William (Billy) Howard Spoor, retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Pillsbury Company, died on November 14, 2014 at his home in Salt Lake City, UT, surrounded by family. He died exactly as he lived, with tremendous grace, great dignity and on his own terms. While our hearts are broken by the idea of life without him, he and our mother, who passed before him, are still very much with us. Our father's incredible work ethic, sense of humor and love of life are at the heart of everything he did. We have all been influenced by his values and spirit. Bill was born January 16, 1923 in Pueblo, CO to Doris Slaughter Spoor and Charles Hinchman Spoor. The family eventually moved to Denver, where he was raised. In 1941, Bill was accepted to Dartmouth College on a full athletic scholarship. He was an incredibly gifted athlete and a fierce competitor. He excelled in all sports, especially football and track and field. In 1942, he volunteered for the US Army's 10th Mountain Division. Bill trained at Camp Hale and spent 3 1/2 years in the Army. Even as a young soldier, his leadership abilities were clearly evident. Instead of being sent overseas with his division, Bill was ordered to officer candidate school. After the war, Bill returned to Dartmouth where he received his degree in history and education in 1949. It was at Dartmouth that he met the love of his life Janet Spain, a student at Smith College. From that moment forward, she would become the most important person in his life. He would forever be ""Billy"" to her. Bill was often heard saying that ""I make the living and Jan makes the living worthwhile."" They were married in NYC on September 23, 1950 and embarked on what was to become, an extraordinary life. After graduating from Dartmouth, Bill began his career with The Pillsbury Company. For more than 20 years Bill focused on his internationalist vision and values, first as Area Sales Manager of Pillsbury's Export Division (New York) and later as Vice President and General Manager of International Operations. He was transferred from New York to Minnesota in 1962. In 1973, he was named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Pillsbury. Bill ran Pillsbury from 1973 until 1985, returning briefly to both positions in 1988. Bill and his team not only brought Pillsbury great profitability, but they ensured it was shared with others. ""Our success as a company fueled our ability to give,"" he said. ""This enabled us to fully fund The Pillsbury Company Foundation and routinely contribute four percent of our domestic taxable income."" Under Bill's leadership, Pillsbury grew dramatically. Much of the growth came through acquisitions, most significantly Green Giant, Haagen-Dazs, Totino's Pizza, Steak & Ale, Godfather's Pizza, American Beauty Macaroni, Van de Kamps and Bumble Bee Tuna, and through the expansion of Burger King. At the time Bill became Chairman and CEO in 1973, Pillsbury sales were $816 million annually, profits were $20 million and earnings per share were $1.60. When he retired from Pillsbury in 1985, sales had grown more than fivefold to $4.7 billion. Profits were $192 million, and earning per share were $4.42. It was, he said, ""a very different company"" when he left. Bill was generous with his time and his good fortune. He served as director and executive committee member of the United Negro College Fund. He helped raise $32 million for the Minnesota Orchestral Association. He served on the executive committee of the Minnesota Historical Society, as a director of the Minneapolis based Inner City Tennis and as chairman of the YWCA Tribute to Women in International Industry. He was also a recipient of the Horatio Alger Award in 1986. Bill enjoyed his work as head of the Capitol City Renaissance Program task force, appointed in 1985 by Gov. Rudy Perpich, to develop a plan for redesigning the area around the Minnesota Capitol. He also served on the National Cambodia Crisis Committee, on the board of the Foundation for Management Education in Central America. He served on the boards of directors of Northwest Bancorporation, Northwestern National Bank, Honeywell, Inc., Dayton-Hudson Corporation, Berkley & Company, Inc., Piper, Jaffray incorporated, The Coleman Company and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts - Las Vegas. Bill's degree from Dartmouth College was one of his most treasured accomplishments. He demonstrated his appreciation in a variety of ways. In return, Bill was honored by Dartmouth with its Presidential medal for Outstanding Leadership and Achievement. He was closely involved with the Dartmouth Dialogues on Leadership, a program established by Pillsbury in his name. His work for Dartmouth and other institutions of learning brought election to Phi Beta Kappa. In 2005, Jan and Bill moved from their Wayzata, MN home of 40 years to Salt Lake City to be closer to their children and grandchildren. An avid fisherman, he and Jan spent many happy hours fishing in Colorado, Minnesota and their beloved Saratoga, WY. He enriched the lives of everyone he touched through his generosity, quick wit, integrity and loyalty. Bill was a larger than life presence, ingenious at turning a phrase, clever and funny beyond measure and lived his life honorably. Bill was preceded in death by his beautiful and loving wife of 63 years, Janet Spain Spoor; his parents Doris Slaughter Spoor, Charles Hinchman Spoor; his sister Dorothy Spoor Arnold and brother Charles Hinchman Spoor, Jr. He is survived by his children Melanie Grace Spoor, Cynthia Field Spoor (Douglas Howard), William Lincoln Spoor (Sarah), six grandchildren: Charles Spoor Howard, Anna Grace Howard, Blakely Madison Spoor, Savannah Spain Spoor, William Walker Spoor and Lincoln Campbell Spoor; his brother T.

484,,"Paid Notice: Deaths SPOOR, WILLIAM 1923, 2014",http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DF1E3AF930A15752C1A9629D8B63,"SPOOR--William 1923 - 2014. William (Billy) Howard Spoor, retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Pillsbury Company, died on November 14, 2014 at his home in Salt Lake City, UT, surrounded by family. He died exactly as he lived, with tremendous grace, great dignity and on his own terms. While our hearts are broken by the idea of life without him, he and our mother, who passed before him, are still very much with us. Our father's incredible work ethic, sense of humor and love of life are at the heart of everything he did. We have all been influenced by his values and spirit. Bill was born January 16, 1923 in Pueblo, CO to Doris Slaughter Spoor and Charles Hinchman Spoor. The family eventually moved to Denver, where he was raised. In 1941, Bill was accepted to Dartmouth College on a full athletic scholarship. He was an incredibly gifted athlete and a fierce competitor. He excelled in all sports, especially football and track and field. In 1942, he volunteered for the US Army's 10th Mountain Division. Bill trained at Camp Hale and spent 3 1/2 years in the Army. Even as a young soldier, his leadership abilities were clearly evident. Instead of being sent overseas with his division, Bill was ordered to officer candidate school. After the war, Bill returned to Dartmouth where he received his degree in history and education in 1949. It was at Dartmouth that he met the love of his life Janet Spain, a student at Smith College. From that moment forward, she would become the most important person in his life. He would forever be ""Billy"" to her. Bill was often heard saying that ""I make the living and Jan makes the living worthwhile."" They were married in NYC on September 23, 1950 and embarked on what was to become, an extraordinary life. After graduating from Dartmouth, Bill began his career with The Pillsbury Company. For more than 20 years Bill focused on his internationalist vision and values, first as Area Sales Manager of Pillsbury's Export Division (New York) and later as Vice President and General Manager of International Operations. He was transferred from New York to Minnesota in 1962. In 1973, he was named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Pillsbury. Bill ran Pillsbury from 1973 until 1985, returning briefly to both positions in 1988. Bill and his team not only brought Pillsbury great profitability, but they ensured it was shared with others. ""Our success as a company fueled our ability to give,"" he said. ""This enabled us to fully fund The Pillsbury Company Foundation and routinely contribute four percent of our domestic taxable income."" Under Bill's leadership, Pillsbury grew dramatically. Much of the growth came through acquisitions, most significantly Green Giant, Haagen-Dazs, Totino's Pizza, Steak & Ale, Godfather's Pizza, American Beauty Macaroni, Van de Kamps and Bumble Bee Tuna, and through the expansion of Burger King. At the time Bill became Chairman and CEO in 1973, Pillsbury sales were $816 million annually, profits were $20 million and earnings per share were $1.60. When he retired from Pillsbury in 1985, sales had grown more than fivefold to $4.7 billion. Profits were $192 million, and earning per share were $4.42. It was, he said, ""a very different company"" when he left. Bill was generous with his time and his good fortune. He served as director and executive committee member of the United Negro College Fund. He helped raise $32 million for the Minnesota Orchestral Association. He served on the executive committee of the Minnesota Historical Society, as a director of the Minneapolis based Inner City Tennis and as chairman of the YWCA Tribute to Women in International Industry. He was also a recipient of the Horatio Alger Award in 1986. Bill enjoyed his work as head of the Capitol City Renaissance Program task force, appointed in 1985 by Gov. Rudy Perpich, to develop a plan for redesigning the area around the Minnesota Capitol. He also served on the National Cambodia Crisis Committee, on the board of the Foundation for Management Education in Central America. He served on the boards of directors of Northwest Bancorporation, Northwestern National Bank, Honeywell, Inc., Dayton-Hudson Corporation, Berkley & Company, Inc., Piper, Jaffray incorporated, The Coleman Company and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts - Las Vegas. Bill's degree from Dartmouth College was one of his most treasured accomplishments. He demonstrated his appreciation in a variety of ways. In return, Bill was honored by Dartmouth with its Presidential medal for Outstanding Leadership and Achievement. He was closely involved with the Dartmouth Dialogues on Leadership, a program established by Pillsbury in his name. His work for Dartmouth and other institutions of learning brought election to Phi Beta Kappa. In 2005, Jan and Bill moved from their Wayzata, MN home of 40 years to Salt Lake City to be closer to their children and grandchildren. An avid fisherman, he and Jan spent many happy hours fishing in Colorado, Minnesota and their beloved Saratoga, WY. He enriched the lives of everyone he touched through his generosity, quick wit, integrity and loyalty. Bill was a larger than life presence, ingenious at turning a phrase, clever and funny beyond measure and lived his life honorably. Bill was preceded in death by his beautiful and loving wife of 63 years, Janet Spain Spoor; his parents Doris Slaughter Spoor, Charles Hinchman Spoor; his sister Dorothy Spoor Arnold and brother Charles Hinchman Spoor, Jr. He is survived by his children Melanie Grace Spoor, Cynthia Field Spoor (Douglas Howard), William Lincoln Spoor (Sarah), six grandchildren: Charles Spoor Howard, Anna Grace Howard, Blakely Madison Spoor, Savannah Spain Spoor, William Walker Spoor and Lincoln Campbell Spoor; his brother T. Richard Spoor (Ann) of Lakeville, CT. Memorials may be directed to the donor's choice."

Joan met her future husband, L. Pierre Ledoux, in the summer of 1941. They were married April 25, 1942 and had a long and devoted marriage. Following the death of her husband in 2001, Joan took over management of his family's company Ledoux & Co., a metallurgical laboratory. She managed the company as President until her death. Joan was a strong woman, full of wisdom and a good sense of humor. She had a great love of life and enjoyed meeting people from everywhere and anywhere. She was interested in knowing the people she met and discussing their interests and lives, having animated conversations and giving excellent advice.

It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our dear friend and colleague Morgan B. Stark, 75, on April 13, 2015. Born in 1939 in New York, New York, Mr. Stark was a legendary investor, dedicated philanthropist and iconic teacher. He is survived by his wife of nearly half a century, Sidney, sons Nick and Mason, daughter-inlaw Jacqueline, and grandchildren Dante and Nicolette. Mr. Stark was a Managing Member of Ramius, LLC where he served most recently as the Chairman of Ramius Alternative Investments and Head of Macro Trading Strategy. Widely regarded as one of the most respected and knowledgeable investors in the industry, Mr. Stark began his career in the 1960s at Chase Manhattan Bank where he received a comprehensive grounding in syndicate management, municipal bonds, bond trading and sales management. He remained with the company in various roles until he joined Chemical Bank as Senior Vice President and Treasury Department Deputy Head in 1979. Mr. Stark's unwavering dedication to his clients and extraordinary knowledge of the financial markets propelled him into roles of increasing importance within the bank, resulting in his appointment to the role of President and CEO of Chemical Securities, Inc., in 1989. After serving in this role for four years, he joined Granite Capital International Group as a Portfolio Manager and Managing Director to develop a non-correlating investment management business. In 1995, he and Thomas W. Strauss joined Ramius as partners with Peter A. Cohen in the development of Ramius' investment management business. Mr. Stark was widely credited for working with his peers to develop Ramius into a successful alternative investment management business with his unwavering commitment to employees and clients. Mr. Stark served as a member of the Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He also once chaired the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Bond Market Association, where he was a long time member. Mr. Stark attended the Cornell University Industrial Labor Relations School and held a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from New York University. He served for three and a half years in the U.S. Marine Corps. In addition to his professional accomplishments, employees recognized Mr. Stark for his generosity and commitment to the long-term welfare of his employees. As Managing Member of Ramius he advocated for employees to have access to a wide range of estate, retirement planning and health care programs and personally advised many colleagues on their use. Known as a skilled raconteur and bon vivant, Mr. Stark had no shortage of hobbies, including music, skiing and golfing. A dedicated gardener, Mr. Stark took up bee keeping in his effort to enhance his floral garden in North Haven, New York. In 2005, Mr. and Mrs. Stark were invited to dinner by legendary violinist and oenophile Itzhak Perlman. Mr. Stark, eager to share his love of fine wines, brought a 1982 Chateau Lynch-Bages. Perlman, it turns out, had planned to serve the very same Bordeaux. A quick friendship developed and Mr. Stark soon after became President of the Board of Directors of the Perlman Music Program where he committed himself to helping the Program renovate its campus to meet the future needs of young musicians. In 2011, Mr. Stark told The Wall Street Journal that his work with the Program, ""Fills my soul,"" and that the young musicians he had met, ""are people that if they don't become the next best and the greatest cello or violin player, they are likely to be doctors or lawyers. But they will be wonderful people."" Mr. Stark was active in a number of industry and philanthropic activities including his position as a member of the Investment Committee for the American Heart Association--Heritage Affiliate. He also previously served as President, Vice President, and member of the Board of Directors of the Dealer Bank Association and as a trustee to various charitable organizations including the Stires-Stark Foundation. Donations may be made in Mr. Stark's memory to The Perlman Music Program, 19 West 69th Street, Suite 304, New York, NY 10023. You will be missed.

282,,"Paid Notice: Deaths STARK, MORGAN",https://www.nytimes.com/Link.asp?I=LS000174653448,"<!-- MORGAN STARK -->STARK--Morgan B.<br/><br/> It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our dear friend and colleague Morgan B. Stark, 75, on April 13, 2015. Born in 1939 in New York, New York, Mr. Stark was a legendary investor, dedicated philanthropist and iconic teacher. He is survived by his wife of nearly half a century, Sidney, sons Nick and Mason, daughter-inlaw Jacqueline, and grandchildren Dante and Nicolette. Mr. Stark was a Managing Member of Ramius, LLC where he served most recently as the Chairman of Ramius Alternative Investments and Head of Macro Trading Strategy. Widely regarded as one of the most respected and knowledgeable investors in the industry, Mr. Stark began his career in the 1960s at Chase Manhattan Bank where he received a comprehensive grounding in syndicate management, municipal bonds, bond trading and sales management. He remained with the company in various roles until he joined Chemical Bank as Senior Vice President and Treasury Department Deputy Head in 1979. Mr. Stark's unwavering dedication to his clients and extraordinary knowledge of the financial markets propelled him into roles of increasing importance within the bank, resulting in his appointment to the role of President and CEO of Chemical Securities, Inc., in 1989. After serving in this role for four years, he joined Granite Capital International Group as a Portfolio Manager and Managing Director to develop a non-correlating investment management business. In 1995, he and Thomas W. Strauss joined Ramius as partners with Peter A. Cohen in the development of Ramius' investment management business. Mr. Stark was widely credited for working with his peers to develop Ramius into a successful alternative investment management business with his unwavering commitment to employees and clients. Mr. Stark served as a member of the Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He also once chaired the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Bond Market Association, where he was a long time member. Mr. Stark attended the Cornell University Industrial Labor Relations School and held a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from New York University. He served for three and a half years in the U.S. Marine Corps. In addition to his professional accomplishments, employees recognized Mr. Stark for his generosity and commitment to the long-term welfare of his employees. As Managing Member of Ramius he advocated for employees to have access to a wide range of estate, retirement planning and health care programs and personally advised many colleagues on their use. Known as a skilled raconteur and bon vivant, Mr. Stark had no shortage of hobbies, including music, skiing and golfing. A dedicated gardener, Mr. Stark took up bee keeping in his effort to enhance his floral garden in North Haven, New York. In 2005, Mr. and Mrs. Stark were invited to dinner by legendary violinist and oenophile Itzhak Perlman. Mr. Stark, eager to share his love of fine wines, brought a 1982 Chateau Lynch-Bages. Perlman, it turns out, had planned to serve the very same Bordeaux. A quick friendship developed and Mr. Stark soon after became President of the Board of Directors of the Perlman Music Program where he committed himself to helping the Program renovate its campus to meet the future needs of young musicians. In 2011, Mr. Stark told The Wall Street Journal that his work with the Program, ""Fills my soul,"" and that the young musicians he had met, ""are people that if they don't become the next best and the greatest cello or violin player, they are likely to be doctors or lawyers. But they will be wonderful people."" Mr. Stark was active in a number of industry and philanthropic activities including his position as a member of the Investment Committee for the American Heart Association--Heritage Affiliate. He also previously served as President, Vice President, and member of the Board of Directors of the Dealer Bank Association and as a trustee to various charitable organizations including the Stires-Stark Foundation. Donations may be made in Mr. Stark's memory to The Perlman Music Program, 19 West 69th Street, Suite 304, New York, NY 10023. You will be missed. Peter Cohen, Tom Strauss, Jeff Solomon and your friends at Cowen and Ramius<br><br>"
