""I'M NOT in the cable business,"" insists Glenn R. Jones, chairman and chief executive of Jones Intercable Inc., Jones Spacelink Ltd., Jones International Ltd. and Mind Extension University. ""I'm in the business of extending the human mind."" Certainly, Mr. Jones, 63, is not your everyday cable executive. The owner of 23-year-old Jones Intercable, the country's seventh-largest cable operator, which owns or manages 44 cable systems serving 1.4 million subscribers in California, New York and 18 other states, sees himself as a visionary pioneer on the information highway, an entrepreneur/ risk-taker, a poet of technology. He works from a high-tech headquarters in Denver. And he reads voraciously, cites science fiction easily and writes books and poetry (as Yankee Jones). Like Ted Turner, Mr. Jones is also producing his own programming. In 1989, he founded the Jones Entertainment Group, which produced the current release ""Household Saints."" And like other cable moguls, Mr. Jones has recently seen his wealth ballooning -- Intercable's shares are up nearly 70 percent since May, trading at around $17 last week -- as Wall Street has become bullish on cable's role in the future delivery of home entertainment. Witness Bell Atlantic's deal for Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator, and the battle between Viacom and QVC Network for Paramount Communications. Indeed, Intercable and Spacelink themselves may merge to help attract a partnership deal or capital from Pacific Telesis or Bell Canada. ""The entertainment business,"" Mr. Jones says, ""impacts the human mind, which is the determination point of the electronic highway. The brain is a three-pound electrochemical device that cooks along at about 25 watts, mostly glucose. It's really the world's first computer."" Mr. Jones's mix of management philosophy and technological jargon suggests a cross between Carl Sagan and Ross Perot. To keep up with the latest ideas, Mr. Jones often buys $500 worth of books at a time and stuffs them into three backpacks, keeping one in the office, one on his five-seater jet and one in the trunk of his white Mercedes. At his Frank Lloyd Wright-style home in Denver, he just finished reading a biography of Jefferson and has started one on John Paul Jones. ""Those people,"" he said, ""talked about the idea of individual freedom and the concept of self-government -- a delicate, tenuous experiment still going on because it was based on having an informed electorate, which brings you right into education. Our democracy needs to become more electronic."" The education of America is Mr. Jones's passion. He has lavished some $30 million on his Mind Extension University since he founded it in 1987 to provide college classes -- with credit -- by cable. This type of education, he said, would not have worked before the advent of the VCR, with its taping capabilities. Right now, 25.5 million subscribers to basic cable systems that carry the MEU channel can watch classes for free, but those seeking credit must enroll at one of the 26 universities. The schools, which charge MEU students less than the full cost of actually attending class, include the University of California at Berkeley, George Washington University, the University of Maryland and Colorado State. Currently, Mr. Jones said, 36,000 students are enrolled in at least one course. Linda Roberts, special adviser on technology for the United States Education Department, gives Mr. Jones credit for being on the cutting edge of the information highway. ""Mind Extension University is a very important example of how we can use today's technological systems, whether cable or interactive fiber,"" she said. While he is proud of his educational mission, Mr. Jones is a bit defensive about MEU's for-profit status as well as its current lack of profits. ""It is a legitimate purpose of the private sector to focus upon and help resolve the intractable problems of our culture,"" he insisted. He added: ""I'm taking the risks. And it's un-American for me not to make a profit somewhere down the line -- about three years."" Mr. Jones is used to being called crazy -- like a fox. ""We started small when people didn't understand the limited partnership concept"" in acquiring cable systems, he said, ""so we had to form our own securities company. We raised $152,000 with the first limited partnership, then started raising $33 million and $55 million at a clip. It was un-American at the time, but it became mainstream when I raised $200 million. Since 1972, we've raised $1.3 billion in capital. We have 170,000 limited partners."" In many ways, Mr. Jones is already living the future. Of the company's 3,600 employees in the Denver area, 350 work in the suburb of Englewood in a glass office building with a helicopter pad. Fiber-optic and coaxial cables snake under the floors. Mr. Jones's circular office has 16 television sets and a computer that can manipulate several satellite dishes. At the center of the building is an atrium, featuring a big reflecting pool with an island. In a ceremony in the atrium each year, Mr. Jones honors one of his employees for a job well done. The employee receives the award on the island as colleagues watch and bagpipes play. ""There's a lot of poetry in business,"" Mr. Jones said. ""Hard as it is."""

Allow the marriage between entertainment and communications giants, we are told, and they will connect students with learning resources, provide a forum for political discourse, increase economic competitiveness and speed us into the multimedia information age. Both broadcast and cable TV were introduced with similar fanfare. The results have been disappointing. Because of regulatory failure and the limits of the technology, they failed to be saviors of education or political life. We love the tube but recognize that it is largely a cultural wasteland."

Like most management lessons these days, it comes from Japan. But this is different from all other Japanese management lessons. This one is about how not to do it. That the lesson was painfully learned in Japan is shown by a simple fact: among all the firms battling for Paramount, not one is Japanese. Three years ago, the only place any sensibly greedy Hollywood studio would look for a buyer or for backing was Japan. After all, in 1989 Sony paid $3.4 billion for Columbia Pictures, owner of the Columbia and Tri-Star studios, and in 1990 Matsushita paid $6.1 billion for MCA, owner of Universal Studios -- still the biggest-ever Japanese takeover in America."

Things slowed down somewhat on the factory floor, though: the average workweek had hit exceptionally high levels recently, but with much of the nation battling ice and snow, it fell by 42 minutes, the biggest shrinkage in 10 years.

He'd worked on programming at ABC and created the Fox network, and he's wanted to get back into prime time -- as witness his failed effort to buy Paramount.

But don't think, as David Letterman suggested, that the ""60 Minutes"" stopwatch will now be ""yours for $49.95."" CBS will, however, get a desired foothold in cable. So why did both CBS and QVC stock jump so sharply?

But until now, talkers have been likely to encounter ear-splitting problems -- sizzling static, interrupted conversations and strange voices one inadvertently overhears on the handsets. Since cordless phones are actually small two-way radios, the farther you travel from the telephone base, the greater the chance for sonic zaps and dead air. A new generation of digital cordless phones using a powerful 900 megahertz (MHz) frequency wipes out most of these problems. These new phones let you roam much farther than the 46 to 49 MHz models, the current standard frequency."

Saying it wanted to rethink its strategy for upgrading its telephone network, the company asked the Federal Communications Commission to suspend its application to offer video services to as many as three million telephone customers in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, the District of Columbia, northern New Jersey and parts of Virginia. The decision by Bell Atlantic surprised many industry experts, who regard the company as a pathfinder for other regional Bells seeking to expand beyond their core business of local phone service. And it underscores the mounting confusion many telephone executives are feeling as they try to adapt their voice networks to an array of new businesses, like video programming and interactive services."

274,1995/04/30,DIARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/30/business/diary-741295.html,"TAKEOVERS The Day Chrysler Fever Broke Two weeks ago, Chrysler's stock soared -- simply because one man, Kirk Kerkorian, said he wanted to buy the company. Since then, the stock has done a tentative dance, with doubts creeping in about the deal but investors, remembering the power of Mr. Kerkorian's 10 percent stake, not quite ready to bail out. But last week the company lashed out at its uninvited suitor, saying it had no interest in ""gambling with Chrysler's future"" and brushing off Mr. Kerkorian's request for a tripling of the dividend (which would add over $100 million to Mr. Kerkorian's annual income). For investors, that seemed to settle it, as the stock fell $2.50 on Wednesday, close to its pre-hysteria level, before creeping up again by week's end. THE ECONOMY Slowing to a Steady Walk Surprise! Interest rates went up -- thanks to the Federal Reserve -- and people stopped buying so much stuff. At the end of last year, Americans were still spending big, and the economy grew at a fast 5.1 percent pace -- just the type of too-frantic growth the Fed wanted to head off. But in this year's first quarter, reality set in, wallets closed -- well, part way -- and economic growth slowed to a 2.8 percent rate, the laziest in two years. Keeping things going were corporations that made big investments in equipment and buildings. All this was apparently fine with the stock market, as the Dow industrials kept bumping along to new records. MUTUAL FUNDS Follow the Money Trail Mutual funds are where the nation's money is, so their vital signs provide good indicators of what, in an economic sense, is going on. If, that is, you can make sense of those vital signs. Last week came word that cash levels in stock funds were down to 7 percent -- the lowest in well over a decade. What's cash for? Basically, redemptions and safety. But with money flowing in and stocks rising, fund managers seem worried about neither. Fund cash is often what powers the market, though, so is this thin wallet worrisome? Not as long as new cash keeps coming -- which it certainly did recently, going into retirement accounts before the dreaded April 17. THE WORKPLACE Those Vanishing Benefits Most employees already know this, of course: companies are getting stingier with benefits. Workers are paying a bigger share of health coverage or being nudged into H.M.O.'s, and must take greater responsibility for retirement through 401(k)'s and the like. But now it's official. A report last week showed that benefit costs for the first quarter showed the smallest rise in eight years. For the past year, in fact, benefit costs rose no faster than overall compensation -- again, for the first time in eight years. The overall report ""confirms that there's no inflation push from wages,"" said Labor Secretary Reich. It also confirms that the days of the all-giving, kindly-uncle employer are vanishing fast. ANTITRUST One Microsoft, Indivisible Soon, no doubt, there'll be a Government agency called the Microsoft Department, or at least a Microsoft Division at the Justice Department. The giant company seems a perennial Washington topic. Just last week Justice officials were defending Microsoft one minute against being called monopolistic and then going to court to block its acquisition of Intuit, maker of Quicken personal-finance software, saying this dominance could lead to higher prices and fewer choices for consumers. No inconsistency, the agency said -- different legal issues. And there's no truth, by the way, to rumors that Microsoft is planning to acquire the Justice Department. Just the mint. BANKING A Human Teller? Naw! In the old days, we'll tell our grandchildren (by e-mail, of course), you actually saw people at bank windows, talked to human beings on the phone, not multiple-choice recordings. They'll smile an indulgent smile, then log on to their sixth-grade math class. It's true, though. Until late April of '95, you could walk into any bank and hand a teller a deposit. But then First Chicago said you had to pay $3 for that honor (unless you had $2,500 stagnating in a checking account) if you could have used an A.T.M. instead. A teller transaction, you see, costs 6 to 12 times what an A.T.M. transaction does, and they had to watch all those pennies. Even though, in yet older days, the world somehow muddled through with -- brace yourselves -- no A.T.M.'s at all. ORANGE COUNTY Mr. Citron Takes His Lumps ""The dog ate my homework"" may work for a young scholar, but for grown-ups, ""the broker ate my lunch"" goes only so far. When you're managing a $7.4 billion government fund, as Robert Citron was in Orange County, you're ultimately responsible. For a while, Mr. Citron insisted he was just a blushing victim when the county lost $1.7 billion, blaming Merrill Lynch for leading him astray, but last week that excuse crumbled when he pleaded guilty to felonies like misappropriating funds and misleading investors. He could get up to 14 years in prison. In other words, derivatives don't make money vanish; people do. INNER CITY Bodegas vs. Pathmark You can't win. In some people's view, the inner city perpetuates poverty partly because a lack of fair-priced supermarkets forces residents to shop at high-priced bodegas. But when a plan emerged for a Pathmark in East Harlem, opponents cried out that the store would hurt bodega owners. The plan seemed doomed right up to the last minute, but then a City Councilman switched sides and the Manhattan Borough Board approved it, the lure of low prices and added jobs apparently winning the day. TECHNOLOGY High-Tech Coffee Break Sometimes we seem to be rushing headlong into a world with all the high-tech stuff jumbled together -- television shows coming out of phones, phone calls coming out of computers, information coming from just about anywhere. But occasionally the world pauses on this mad dash, as when Bell Atlantic decided last week to rethink its idea of offering video services to three million phone customers. Even though the company was well along in the F.C.C. approval process, it said its executives needed to ""to catch our breath."" So does this point, as some suggested, to mounting confusion in this whole pile-up of technologies? Or does Bell Atlantic just want, as it says, to hold out for better fiber-optic technology? Stay, uh, tuned. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION And the Sons Did Homework Thursday was Take Our Daughters to Work Day, a jubilant little affirmative-action idea cooked up a few years ago by the Ms. Foundation. Nationwide, perhaps six million girls played hooky to get a glimpse of the way the adult world works -- or at least the way it works with six million rosy little souls playing hopscotch in the staid hallways of commerce. But ""affirmative action"" is a dirty word these days -- O.K., two words -- so the glee is now tempered with dissension. Why were boys left out? They get precious little chance to watch Dad -- and Mom -- work. Not to mention that if they saw women doing all sorts of jobs, a lesson might sink in. Then again, why shouldn't girls hog the spotlight for a day? Then again . . . oh, who knows."

Phone companies have been bringing and winning First Amendment challenges to the policy in Federal courts around the country.

But it would be a mistake to think that the AT&T breakup signals a reversal of the trend toward giantism or suggests that other companies now trying to grow large through mergers are making a huge error. The truth is that AT&T's decision was driven by peculiar legislative and competitive circumstances that affect it alone. The breakup reveals little about whether other mergers will proceed apace or slack off. Nor will it reshape the media, phone or computer markets. What the decision does reflect is a management that rejected faddish reasons to remain a huge merged entity in order to take account of its company's unique circumstance."

The merger would likely reduce the number of phone companies that will compete for local phone customers, thus lessening the incentive to offer lower prices or better service. But the two companies might be able to show that the merger will create large savings that can be passed along to customers. The Justice Department and Federal regulators owe consumers a probing investigation before they grant approval. The merged company would be the second-largest telecommunications firm, exceeded only by AT&T, with about $25 billion in revenues, 35 million customers and 130,000 employees spread out over 12 Eastern states. Bell Atlantic and Nynex do not serve the same households, so there will be no immediate effect on competition for the business of local phone customers. The merger might nevertheless help customers if it produces substantial cost savings. New Yorkers can also take heart that Bell Atlantic's well-regarded management will almost certainly improve the erratic customer service now provided by Nynex."

Are we moving toward a new national monopoly -- like the old Bell system, before it was broken up -- with control over cable TV and other media? That is the wrong question. Nationally, there is now more choice in the communications field. In the early 1980's, AT&T controlled 80 percent of local telephone service and almost all long-distance service. Today, it has about 55 percent of the long-distance market and that will erode more as the Baby Bells compete.
