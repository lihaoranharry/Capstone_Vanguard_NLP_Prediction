A1 Impeachment in Mexico In a vote that casts doubt on the legitimacy of Mexico's fledgling democracy, Mexico City's popular leftist mayor lost a battle in congress that is likely to force him off the ballot in next year's presidential elections and could see him imprisoned. A1 Pope's Will Is Released According to the will of Pope John Paul II, as he ushered Christianity into the third millennium he wrestled with thoughts about the end of his papacy, perhaps even entertaining a momentous possibility: his resignation. A1 As dignitaries and ordinary worshipers continued to pour into Rome for Pope John Paul II's funeral, the final visitors paid their last respects in St. Peter's Basilica, before his body was to be transferred to a simple cypress coffin. A10 Cardinal Bernard Law, who was forced to resign in disgrace as archbishop of Boston two years ago for protecting sexually abusive priests, was named by the Vatican as one of nine prelates who will have the honor of presiding over funeral Masses for Pope John Paul II. A10 A Secular Mourning in France France may be a predominantly Roman Catholic country, but it is also officially secular. So while the death of Pope John Paul II has brought widespread mourning, there has also been pressure on the French republic not to honor him officially. A12 C.I.A. to Review Faulty Source Porter J. Goss, the director of central intelligence, has ordered an internal review to resolve conflicting claims about why the Central Intelligence Agency did not do more to raise doubts about an Iraqi defector known as Curveball after the German intelligence service questioned his credibility, according to intelligence officials.

A16 NATIONAL A18-24 Higher Gasoline Prices Carry Political Costs The government forcast that gasoline prices would surge even higher and remain high through the summer, underscoring both the economic impact of the sharp rise in energy costs and the growing political risks for President Bush.

B1 Subway Fire Stops Service One transit worker and five subway riders were injured, and more than 600 people were evacuated from three trains, when an underground power room for the subway system caught fire inside a tunnel in Harlem, sending smoke through the tunnels and suspending service on the A, B, C and D lines.

Appearing in Portsmouth, N.H., where 850 people turned out at a talk for writers presented by New Hampshire Public Radio and the Music Hall of Portsmouth, Mr. Brown, right, said it was not his responsibility to grapple with disputes ignited by his best-seller ''The Da Vinci Code,'' The Associated Press reported. He said: ''Let the biblical scholars and historians battle it out. It's a book about big ideas; you can love them or you can hate them. But we're all talking about them, and that's really the point.'' Mr. Brown, a former English teacher, disclosed that he dangles from gravity boots when mulling over a difficult plot point, that he would like to return to the classroom and that, with the exception of ''The Da Vinci Code,'' he rarely reads his work when it is finished. Referring to the recent copyright infringement case involving the book, he said: ''By the way, if anybody in the audience would like to sue me, we have forms out back. Just pick one up on your way out.''

Behind J. S. Bach Tired of all the controversy over who really wrote Shakespeare's plays? O.K. How about: Who really wrote some great Johann Sebastian Bach music? And the answer is Anna Magdalena, the second Mrs. Bach. That, at least, is the theory of Martin Jarvis, a professor at the Charles Darwin University School of Music in Darwin, Australia, and conductor of the city's orchestra, as reported by The Telegraph of London. According to Professor Jarvis, Anna Magdalena (1701-1760), widely regarded as Bach's copyist, actually wrote his six Cello Suites, played a substantial role in the composition of the aria from the ''Goldberg'' Variations and probably wrote the first prelude of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Book 1. Professor Jarvis, who said he used forensic science techniques to scrutinize the manuscripts, said the absence of an original J. S. Bach manuscript of the suites, as well as the music itself, suggested that existing scores in the hand of Anna Magdalena were original. Reaction among scholars and musicians informed of the Jarvis theories, to be published this year, ranged from intrigued to dismissive. Free Philharmonic Concert The New York Philharmonic will give its annual free Memorial Day concert at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine on May 29 at 8 p.m. Xian Zhang, associate conductor, will lead the orchestra in the Overture to Verdi's ''Forza del Destino'' and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5.

Jobs, the company's co-founder and chief executive, was back last week to introduce an iPod that can play video. Behind the News -- The bells and whistles of an Apple product unveiling are never to be ignored, but this time it was wedding bells: iPod and television are the happy couple. The new device can shop online for episodes from some ABC and Disney Channel shows, including from the night before, for about $2 a pop. The move comes after two years of Mr. Jobs's saying that nobody would watch a movie on a two-inch screen. TO BOSTON WE GO The News -- JetBlue said Tuesday that next month it would introduce 10 daily flights between New York and Boston. Behind the News -- It's the kind of airfare that could almost make a Yankee fan want to go into enemy territory: $25 one way, for tickets bought by this Thursday. Thereafter the flight will cost $40 to $120. But the route has long been dominated by the traditional major carriers, and they were not without an answer for JetBlue's latest nudging onto their turf. The next day American Airlines began offering $25 tickets on the same route, and Delta introduced a $40 fare. Take that, rookie. THE FOOT-WIDE JOURNAL The News -- The Wall Street Journal plans to shrink by about the width of the 'Street' in its banner. Behind the News -- The measure comes on the heels of The Journal's plan to shrink its international edition to tabloid size, starting next month. Both moves are in part a response to the increase in the cost of newsprint, an industrywide concern that has led other papers to similar decisions. Making The Journal smaller is expected to save its owner, Dow Jones, about $18 million a year. The company has said that it expected the smaller size to be more appealing to readers. ANOTHER GOOD THING? The News -- Martha Stewart is taking on a new partner, the housing developer KB Homes. The deal calls for a subdivision in Cary, N.C., to incorporate the style of Ms. Stewart's own homes into its 650 houses. Behind the News -- Before anyone who wants to live like Martha packs up the free-range chickens and heads to Cary, there are one or two questions to consider: one, is the housing industry heading into a downturn, and two, is Ms. Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, whose stock has fallen since March, diluting its brand as it branches into areas like satellite radio and music producing? YOU'VE GOT AOL! The News -- AOL.com has positioned itself as a free Web portal in recent months, with much of the content that used to be available only to subscribers now open to everyone. Last week, Time Warner, AOL's parent, officially unveiled the advertising campaign for it (at a cost estimated at $50 million). Behind the News -- The paying user continues to flee AOL, but Web sites that are part of it -- Moviefone, Mapquest, Netscape -- are a draw. That appeal may be behind talks between Time Warner and others regarding potential investments in AOL. Microsoft, Google, Comcast and Yahoo have been named as suitors or potential suitors.",

555,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/20/business/can-cable-fast-forward-past-tivo.html,Can Cable Fast-Forward Past TiVo?,"TiVo, the best-known maker of digital video recorders, may need to worry about people like Peter S. Palermo. But Mr. Palermo may also represent just what the cable television industry has been looking for. A few weeks before the P.G.A. Championship golf tournament in Rochester in August, Mr. Palermo, a real estate broker, was trying to figure out how he would record the broadcast. Mr. Palermo thought about buying a TiVo, the digital video recorder, or DVR. Using a computer hard drive and advanced software, a DVR lets the user pause, rewind and fast-forward even with live television programs. It also provides a much easier way to automatically record programs than is possible with videocassette recorders. In the end, Mr. Palermo was turned off from TiVo by the prospect of having to connect all kinds of wires and adding a new box to his home entertainment system. So, instead, he ordered a relatively new product that his cable company, Time Warner Cable, a unit of Time Warner, has been pitching: a set-top box made by Scientific-Atlanta with a DVR already built in. ''The fact that we could do this without the difficulty and complexity of a stand-alone thing made this a perfect fit,'' Mr. Palermo said in a telephone interview on Friday. Mr. Palermo is not alone, and Wall Street and the television industry are taking note. TiVo pioneered the DVR and the TiVo brand -- like Frisbee, Kleenex and Xerox -- has become synonymous with an entire product category. Nonetheless, TiVo's original business of selling stand-alone DVR boxes, along with a monthly support service, appears in danger of being eclipsed by products that are much less expensive for consumers and are integrated with devices that many consumers are already comfortable with, like television set-top boxes. The new DVR-ready set-top boxes offered by cable companies generally cost consumers nothing upfront and add about $10 to a monthly cable bill. That compares with having to pay at least $200 upfront to buy a stand-alone TiVo recorder and, in most cases, taking on a $12.95 monthly subscription. And stand-alone digital recorders -- not only from TiVo but also from smaller companies like ReplayTV, which is owned by Digital Networks North America. -- often require cumbersome connections to existing set-top boxes and televisions. ''This really is the last stand for the stand-alone boxes; this is a dying product,'' Aditya Kishore, an analyst for the Yankee Group, a technology consulting research firm in Boston, said in a telephone interview. ''This is the last Christmas for the stand-alone TiVo box, or any stand-alone DVR box. By next year, the DVR functionality will be widely available in a wide range of other devices, including the set-top boxes.'' It is an issue with enormous implications for advertisers, broadcasters, cable-television carriers and satellite-television providers. The Yankee Group estimates that, so far, 2.5 million to 2.8 million of the nation's roughly 110 million homes have digital video recorders. But DVR's inspire fierce loyalty from those who have them, terrify advertisers (because they can be used to skip commercials) and are seen by many media experts as the future of television. The Yankee Group estimates that in four years, almost 25 million homes will have digital video recorders and that about two-thirds of those will be DVR's that have been integrated into satellite or cable set-top decoders. Even now, while TiVo is the best-known DVR brand, only about 17 percent of the nation's DVR's are stand-alone TiVo-brand units, according to Yankee Group estimates. By far, the leading DVR provider is the EchoStar Communications Corporation, the No.2 satellite-television provider after DirecTV. EchoStar does business as the Dish Network and has developed a digital recording system, which it combines with a satellite television receiver. Last month, EchoStar announced that it had sold its one-millionth DVR unit. ''We believe that over time, DVR technology is going to be the standard,'' said Mark W. Jackson, an EchoStar senior vice president. ''Everyone is going to have it. It's just a question of when -- and who they get it from, of course.'' Time Warner Cable, the No.2 cable-television provider behind the Comcast Corporation, now offers set-top boxes with built-in digital recording in 28 of its 31 local markets. The company expects to soon announce that it had around 250,000 DVR subscribers at the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, Comcast has been concentrating mostly on video-on-demand, which allows customers to view programs stored on a centralized server operated by the cable company. Still, Comcast is also offering the Scientific-Atlanta digital recorder in a few markets and hopes to widely roll out and market a new DVR-enabled set-top box from Motorola early next year. Those threats are a big reason why TiVo's shares have lost 40 percent of their value in recent months, closing down 31 cents, or 3.5 percent, at $8.67 on the Nasdaq on Friday. That is off their 52-week high from July of $14.51. That same danger is also why TiVo, which is based in Alviso, Calif., is scrambling to remake its business model. While sales are expected to be robust this holiday shopping season, the long-term viability of stand-alone DVR's appears dubious. In response, the company is reinventing itself as a supplier of software to other companies that want to make their own DVR's. ''People traditionally might think of us as a company that builds a box and has a service with that box,'' Michael Ramsay, TiVo's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview last week. ''We have transitioned from that model much more to a pure software and services model for our company. We will spend less and less time on the hardware side of what we're doing, so that people who build the DVR hardware become our customers, not our competitors.'' Consumer electronics manufacturers including the Pioneer Corporation and the Toshiba Corporation are already marketing new sorts of combination products that include digital recorders with TiVo software. But Tivo's goal of becoming a pure software vendor also carries risks of its own, namely: Why should a company that has DVR technology of its own pay TiVo instead? According to senior cable-television executives, TiVo is trying to persuade them to use TiVo software in ''premium'' versions of their DVR products. Those executives say TiVo's pitch is that while Motorola's or Scientific-Atlanta's recording systems might be fine for the low-price end of the market, TiVo's more-advanced software appeals to consumer with more money to spend. Mr. Ramsay of TiVo would not discuss specifics of his negotiations with cable companies, but, for now, executives at the biggest cable companies appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach to TiVo's overtures. In that vein, perhaps the biggest uncertainties facing TiVo are the plans of Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation has agreed to acquire control of DirecTV, a unit of the Hughes Corporation. The News Corporation already controls a company called NDS, which is developing its own DVR technology. The DirecTV acquisition is expected to be completed by early next year, and the NDS relationship raises at least the threat that DirecTV, until now TiVo's most important customer, could spurn TiVo for another partner. A News Corporation spokesman declined to comment. Back in Rochester, meanwhile, Mr. Palermo is focused on the World Series. A former minor league player in the Baltimore Orioles's organization, he said he liked to use his DVR to pause, rewind and analyze the motions of hitters and pitchers. He has repeatedly reviewed the home run by Aaron Boone early last Friday morning that propelled the New York Yankees into the series with the Florida Marlins. ''Let me put it this way,'' Mr. Palermo said of his DVR, ''I got to enjoy that home run a whole lot more than anyone else watching.''",2003/10/20

But it's not too early for federal regulators to stop distracting themselves with small-change debates over the sanctity of the Super Bowl halftime show and focus on remaking the nation's policy on media companies for the 21st century. Comcast should have to work harder to woo federal regulators on this $54.1 billion deal than to persuade Disney shareholders to permit the takeover. It is too soon to offer a final judgment on the merger, but it raises serious concerns about the excessive concentration of media content and distribution channels in one corporation. Comcast will have difficulty countering legitimate fears that marrying the nation's largest cable system with the ABC broadcasting network, with cable networks like ESPN and with movie studios could undermine the competitive marketplace of ideas so crucial to democracy.",2004/02/12

Even so, when ABC broadcasts the 76th annual presentation of the Oscars on Sunday, Feb. 29, the commercials will probably get much more attention than usual. The reason, of course, is the continuing uproar over what took place during the CBS broadcast of Super Bowl XXXVIII on Feb. 1. The complaints that pitches for brands like Bud Light, Charmin, Cialis, Lay's, Levitra and Sierra Mist were almost as tasteless as the antics of the performers in the halftime show have led to renewed calls for more careful consideration of the content of commercials -- particularly during so-called big-event television programs like the presentations of the Academy Awards, the Grammy Awards and the Super Bowl, watched by tens of millions of viewers of all ages.",2004/02/12

373,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/01/business/media/01disney.html,"Disney Posts Higher Profits, Lifted by Hits On Television","The Walt Disney Company announced better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Monday, buoyed by turnarounds in its television and theme park businesses that helped to offset a decline in its movie division. Disney's chief financial officer, Thomas O. Staggs, predicted double-digit earnings growth for the next year. Mr. Staggs spoke from a ballroom at the Walt Disney Resort, where analysts and investors were gathered for their yearly conference. Net income for the first quarter of 2005 was up 5 percent, to $723 million, from $688 million in the period a year earlier. Diluted per-share earnings were 35 cents, higher than analysts' expectations. Thomson First Call had predicted a consensus of 29 cents a share. Revenue was relatively flat, increasing 1 percent, to $8.66 billion. The results were welcome for Disney and its investors. The company has shown signs of a rebound after years of foundering. The ABC network has had solid hits in ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Lost,'' visitors are starting to return to theme parks, and ESPN, one of Disney's most valuable properties, continues to report higher affiliate revenues. The results are also expected to reflect positively on the president of Disney, Robert A. Iger, who hopes to succeed the chief executive, Michael D. Eisner. Mr. Eisner said last year that he would not seek to renew his contract after September 2006. In contrast to most of the company's earnings presentations, at this one, Mr. Eisner and Mr. Iger were absent, attending meetings with directors and senior executives, and did not address the analysts. Many questions about Disney's businesses were left unanswered as Mr. Staggs told the crowd it would learn more at division presentations on Tuesday. This year's analyst conference was subdued, in contrast to last year's meeting, when the Comcast Corporation, the largest cable operator in the United States, made an unsolicited $54.1 billion takeover offer for Disney. At last year's meeting, Disney's strong earnings were overshadowed by questions about its future and what role Mr. Eisner would play in it. In the most recent quarter, ended Dec. 31, operating income in the media networks division, which comprises properties like ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel, was up 36 percent over the period a year earlier, to $467 million. The cable networks soared 67 percent. ''You all have seen what hits do for a network and how the margins can swing dramatically,'' Mr. Staggs said, referring to the ABC network. Parks and resorts, for their part, were up 11 percent in operating income to $258 million, from $232 million a year earlier. Results for studio entertainment were damped compared with the quarter last year, when blockbusters like ''Finding Nemo,'' ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' and the platinum release of the Disney classic ''The Lion King'' buoyed the division to operating income of $458 million. On Monday, Disney announced operating income of $333 million for the same time period, largely because of lower DVD sales. Disney has yet to announce its separation from Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the co-founders of Miramax Films, who are expected to leave Disney and begin their own filmmaking venture. People involved in those talks say an announcement could be made in the next two weeks. Mr. Staggs said Disney was going to expand into video games, investing less than $50 million as it explores the business.",2005/02/01

397,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/arts/27RICH.html,Hollywood Bets on Chris Rock's 'Indecency',"THE total box office for all five best-picture nominees on tonight's Oscars is so small that their collective niche in the national cultural marketplace falls somewhere between square dancing and non-Grisham fiction. But if this year's Oscars are worthless as a barometer of the broad state of American pop culture, there's much to learn from the hype spun by ABC and the motion picture academy to seduce Americans to watch even if they can't distinguish Clive Owen from Catalina Sandino Moreno. The selling of the Oscar show is the latest indicator of the most telling disconnect in our politics: in the post-Janet Jackson era, ''indecency'' is gaining in popularity in direct proportion to Washington's campaign to shut indecency down. Hollywood can read the numbers. Once the feds vowed to smite future ''wardrobe malfunctions,'' the customers started bolting the annual TV franchises where those malfunctions and their verbal counterparts are apt to occur. An award show sanitized of vulgarity and encased in the prophylactic of tape delay is an oxymoron. And so the Golden Globes lost 40 percent of its audience in January on NBC, the Grammys lost 28 percent of its audience this month on CBS. The viewers turned up instead at the competing ''Desperate Housewives'' on ABC, where S-and-M is the latest item on the carnal menu. Though this year's Super Bowl didn't have to go up against that runaway hit, its born-again family-friendliness also took a ratings toll; the audience in the all-important 18-to-49 demographic fell to an all-time low. The viewers perked up only for a GoDaddy.com commercial parodying a Washington ''Broadcast Censorship Hearing'': TiVo reported that the spot's utterly unrevealing ''wardrobe malfunction'' gag was the most replayed moment from any of the game's ads, much as the Jackson-Timberlake pas de deux that inspired it was the TiVo sensation of the year before.",2005/02/27

The Mets' prospects were playing the Detroit Tigers' prospects. One of the Mets' most promising young players on the island, a 17-year-old shortstop named Samuel Jiuz, was making his first start. As he took infield and batting practice, it was easy to see why the Mets are so high on Jiuz. He possesses what scouts call ''plus tools'' -- a strong arm, soft hands, speed and power -- as well as a ''good body.'' Lean and muscular, he appears in no danger of growing fat. Right now, he's listed at 6-foot-3 and 176 pounds, but with better nutrition and weight training, the Mets' senior scout for the Dominican Republic, Eddy Toledo, expects him to put on 25 pounds of muscle over the next few years. Scouts like to match a prospect with the major leaguer whom he most closely resembles; Toledo compares Jiuz to the former All-Star shortstop Tony Fernandez. Both of Jiuz's parents died years ago -- his mother in a motor-scooter accident, his father of a lung ailment -- and he was raised by an uncle in San Pedro de Macorís, the Dominican Republic's most fertile source of major leaguers. Jiuz started playing baseball at age 9 with a makeshift glove, fashioned from a milk carton, and a homemade ball, essentially a small rock wrapped in twine and then dropped in a sock.

They were kvetching that the Federal Communications Commission had gotten it terribly wrong in pushing to loosen the way that cable television channels were packaged and sold. Essentially, the cable contingent says that its current practice of selling a package of 75 or so broadcast and cable channels is better for consumers and the public good than letting people pick and choose the 10 or 20 stations they actually watch. The average price of extended basic cable -- the type of channel package to which most of the nation's 73 million cable-watching households subscribe -- is $41 a month, according to Kagan Research. Plenty of other premium channels and services are available, but the only cheaper option is truly basic: a package of mostly local stations with none of the popular cable channels (ESPN, MTV and CNN, to name but a few).
