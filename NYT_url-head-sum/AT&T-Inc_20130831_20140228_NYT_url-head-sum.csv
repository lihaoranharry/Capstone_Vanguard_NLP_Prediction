He was 41 years old. He was a father, husband, son, brother, friend, accomplished builder, sea captain, big wave surfer, philanthropist, saltwater fisherman, snowboarder, soccer and hockey player. He is survived by his wife, Uli (Ulrike) De Vreese Martinez, his daughters, Juliana De Vreese Martinez, 7, and Esmee Nicolina Martinez, 4, his parents, Antonia Viatori Martinez and Albert A. Martinez, his step-father, Friedrich (Fritz) Pangratz, his sister, the Honorable Stefanie A. Martinez, brother-in-law, Sergeant Steve Garcia, nieces, Isabela Martinez Thibodeau and Sofia Martinez Thibodeau, nephews, Nicolas Martinez and Maximilian Martinez, great-aunt Magali Leiseca, aunts, Maria Ryan, Joanna Martinez, Sister Maria Viatori, OCD, Nancy Anne Viatori, and uncles, Wilfred Martinez, Maximilian Viatori and Robert Ryan. Mark was recognized by colleagues, friends and family members for his honest nature and can-do attitude. There was never an obstacle that Mark didn't meet with a smile and tackle with vigor, determination and grace. His unique style and presence, especially in the face of challenges others would have shied away from, distinguished him as an individual. Doing good by doing right was his way. Mark was defined by generosity and fierce loyalty. Mark invested 100% of himself into everything he committed to - his family, friends, sports and business. Family was paramount for Mark. Mark was a resident of both Manhattan and Southampton, NY. He was born in Rochester, NY on November 7th, 1972. Mark grew up in Rumson, NJ where he attended Rumson Country Day School, Rumson Fair Haven High School and ultimately matriculated to UNC Wilmington, where he was a member of the Chi Phi fraternity. Professionally, Mark built upon the foundation that his father created when he assumed responsibility of Interior Management, Inc (IMI). He had a specific vision for the company, focused on quality workmanship and culture, and has grown the business into Manhattan, the Hamptons, and New Jersey's foremost construction and renovation partner. A Memorial Visitation will be held at Frank E. Campbell at 1076 Madison Ave. Monday January 27th from 4pm-9pm. A Memorial Mass will be held at The Church of St. Ignatius Loyola at 980 Park Ave. on Tuesday January 28th at 4pm. In lieu of flowers the family is requesting donations to Habitat for Humanity."

The board and staff of the Tinker Foundation Incorporated mourn the passing of its former Chairman and President, Martha T. Muse. She died on Sunday, February 9th, in Stuart, Florida after a brief illness. Martha was born in Dallas, Texas in 1926, the daughter of John Blackburn Muse and Kathryn Poole Burbank, but lived in New York City for most of her life. She maintained residences in New York City, Connecticut and Florida. Her principal interests focused on Latin America, but she contributed substantially to educational, corporate and non-profit areas. Martha was a founding director of the Tinker Foundation. She served as its president for 27 years and its chairman for 33 years, retiring in 2008. It was under her direction that the Foundation became a leading funder of Latin American-related activities providing support for educational, environmental, security, economic, legal and governance issues. Martha received her undergraduate degree from Barnard College in 1948 and a master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1955. In 1981 she received an honorary doctorate from Georgetown University. She was the first woman elected as a trustee to Columbia University and was among the first women named to the Board of the New York Stock Exchange and the Council on Foreign Relations. She served on numerous corporate boards including The Bank of New York, May Department Stores, Sterling Drug Inc., ASARCO, ACF Industries and Associated Dry Goods. Her non-profit boards included the Americas Society, the Spanish Institute, and the Luso-American Development Foundation. For her many contributions to the field of Latin American relations she received numerous awards: Orden del Sol del Peru, Order of Bernardo O'Higgins (Chile), Order de Mayo al Merito (Argentina); Ordem Nacional do Cruzeiro do Sul (Brazil), and awards from the Spanish Institute and the Americas Society. She was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Colony Club, the Huguenot Society and the National Society of Colonial Dames. One of her final directives to the Tinker Foundation was incorporating Antarctica-related subjects under its funding mandate. Her support of Antarctica was recognized in 2009 by the establishment of the Muse Prize for Science and Policy in Antarctica, an award for mid-career Antarctic scientists and policy makers. A memorial service will be held in New York City in the late spring. Letters of inquiry and condolence may be sent to the Tinker Foundation, 55 E. 59th St., New York, NY 10022."

Mark was recognized by colleagues, friends and family members for his honest nature and can-do attitude. There was never an obstacle that Mark didn't meet with a smile and tackle with vigor, determination and grace. His unique style and presence, especially in the face of challenges others would have shied away from, distinguished him as an individual. Doing good by doing right was his way. Mark was defined by generosity and fierce loyalty. Mark invested 100% of himself into everything he committed to - his family, friends, sports and business. Family was paramount for Mark. Mark was a resident of both Manhattan and Southampton, NY. He was born in Rochester, NY on November 7th, 1972.

Pete passed away peacefully on the evening of November 19, 2013 in Chatham, New Jersey. Pete was well known and loved by many and lived a rich and rewarding life. The son of Elliston Perot Bissell, Jr. and Ann Packard Bissell, Pete was born In Jamaica Queens New York on May 26th, 1935. He spent his early years in Morristown, New Jersey and Haverford, Pennsylvania. He attended the Episcopal School in Philadelphia and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire in 1953. Pete attended Harvard College, where he majored in Biochemical Sciences. While at Harvard he was a member of the Hasty Pudding, Lampoon, and President of the Phoenix-S.K. After graduating from Harvard in 1957, Pete joined the US Navy as a junior lieutenant. He was married to Edith (Edie) Mabelle Roach of Newtown Square, Pennsylvania in March 1958. Pete and Edie spent the early years of their marriage in Japan while he was stationed at the Yokosuka Naval base attached to a naval intelligence unit. After his discharge from active duty in 1961, Pete continued to serve in the Naval Reserves for 30 years and retired with the rank of Commander. Following his return to Philadelphia in 1961, Pete went to work for Pennsylvania Bell. Pete had a long and distinguished career at AT&T and its predecessor companies including vice president of Diamond State Telephone Company, working in AT&T's international division, and finally serving in AT&T's global strategy group. His career took him to many interesting places including living in Egypt from 1982 to 1984. He also gained recognition through obtaining two patents for proprietary telecommunication devices. Pete retired in from AT&T in 1997. In addition to his work, Pete played a very active role in numerous community organizations including the Kiwanis in Norristown, Pennsylvania, the Rotary Club of Wilmington, Delaware (serving as President in 1981), the Opportunity Center, Inc (a group that seek to educate and help the disabled), and the Urban League of Wilmington. Pete will be remembered fondly by the many lives he touched. He was always willing to lend a helping hand or provide sage advice. Pete had many hobbies gardening, HO Gage trains, model building, furniture making, bridge, military history, fine wine collecting, and painting lead soldiers. An avid golfer, he was a member of the Merion Golf Club, Pine Valley Golf Club, and the Morris County Golf Club. He was also a member of the Morristown Club. Pete was well known as a bon-vivant and a humorous raconteur! After nearly 40 years of happy marriage, Edie passed away. Pete was very lucky and fortunate to fall in love with and in 1999 marry Elizabeth (Betty) Lee Cutler. Pete and Betty had a wonderful time together and spending time with their 13 grandchildren. For many years they spent their winters in Albufeira, Portugal and summers at Fossil Hill Farm in Morristown, New Jersey. In these years Pete and Betty continued to explore the four corners of the earth and hone their prodigious bridge skills.

Anne, Senior Vice President of Emblem Health, a New York based Health insurance Company, had been living and working in NYC for a little over a year. After a successful career with AT&T, she retired in 1998 to pursue other interests, including a short period with Michigan Consolidate Gas and Gen Three in Boston. Anne then came to the Healthcare industry with leadership positions at WellPoint, where she was responsible for the rollout of their Medicare Part D product, then DaVita Inc. with their Home Healthcare Division and finally with Emblem Health where she was responsible for Operations and IT.
