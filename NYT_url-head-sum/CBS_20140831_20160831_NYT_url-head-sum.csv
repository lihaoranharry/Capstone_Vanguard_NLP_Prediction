Award-winning author of non-fiction for young adults; enthusiastic wife, mother, grandmother and friend. Raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. After graduating from Adelphi College in 1937, Rhoda became a ""career girl"". She produced several programs for CBS radio and later wrote feature articles for several national magazines. In 1944, she met Gerald Blumberg, a successful attorney, and they married six months later. Moving from Brooklyn in 1951 to a farm in what was then a rural part of Westchester County, Rhoda dedicated the next 20+ years to raising their four children. She enjoyed teaching her children the joys of nature and sharing her passion for classical music, travel and tennis. When her youngest child entered college in the early 1970s, her interest in history and the exhilaration of research triumphed, and Rhoda returned to her typewriter. During the next 30 years, she wrote and composed over 25 non-fiction books. She had an uncanny ability to find and incorporate fascinating anecdotes that brought history to life for millions of young adults (and their parents). Her books received numerous awards, including the Boston Globe Horn Book Award, the Newbery Honor Medal, Orbis Pictus Award for Outstanding Non-Fiction for Children, and multiple Golden Kite awards. Her books included ""Commodore Perry in the Land of the Shogun"" (1985), ""The Incredible Journey of Lewis and Clark"" (1987), ""The Great American Gold Rush"" (1989), ""Shipwrecked!

Jerry Blumberg died in 2009 shortly after their 64th wedding anniversary.

Ralph was a founder of Viacom International Inc. and served as its President and CEO from 1971 to 1983 and as Chairman until July 1987. Ralph was born in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1933, as a young child, he was forced to flee from the Nazis with his family to Paris, where he was educated. In 1940, they then escaped Paris. A harrowing three-month journey through France ensued, and Ralph carried his grandmother over the Pyrenees mountains. Eventually, under the auspices of the International Rescue Committee, the family arrived in the United States in December, 1940. He began his communications career in radio and joined the DuMont Television Network in 1950. He moved to CBS in 1954, progressing to CBS Group President, prior to the inception of Viacom. Ralph was instrumental in spinning off Viacom from CBS in 1971. During his tenure, Viacom acquired cable television systems, initiated Showtime, The Cable Health Network (now Lifetime), MTV, Nickelodeon, The Movie Channel, VH-1, and bought back the half of Showtime which had previously been sold to Warner. Eventually, Viacom, in turn, acquired CBS. Ralph authored an autobiography, ""Television Tightrope - How I Escaped Hitler, Survived CBS and Fathered Viacom,"" published in April 2007, and also wrote ""How Broadcasting and Cable Happened (in spite of the FCC).""

He was a past-President of both the International Radio & Television Society and its Foundation. In 1985 the IRTS honored him with its Gold Medal, one of the most prestigious awards in communications for his outstanding contributions to the industry. A former director and member of the Executive Committee of the National Cable Television Association, (now the National Cable & Telecommunications Association), Mr. Baruch served for seven years as Chairman of an NCTA committee instrumental in the passage by Congress of the Cable Act of 1984. Under President Reagan, Ralph served for seven years as Chairman of the USIA's Television Communications Board of Advisors and as a member of the President's International Youth Exchange Initiative. In 1988, he served as a Senior Fellow of the Freedom Forum at Columbia University. Ralph was a co-founder, immediate past Chairman and Chairman Emeritus of the National Academy of Cable Programming. He received the Academy's first ""Governor's Award,"" recognizing his contributions to the development of cable programming. He received the cable television industry's highest honor, the Vanguard Award, three of the NCTA's President's Awards, and its Chairman of the Year Award. In 1994 Ralph was honored with a special award from the International Academy of Television Arts and in 1999, Walter Cronkite presented him with an Emmy for the International Academy of Television Arts& Sciences. Seven years later, he was inducted into the Cable Hall of Fame. Then, in 2011, Ralph was the inaugural recipient of the WNET Distinguished Service Award. Ralph was a co-founder of C- Span, and often testified before regulatory agencies and committees of the Senate and House. He also served as Chairman of the NCTA's Pay Cable Committee, instrumental in removing FCC industry restrictions.

Pioneer in Design Journalism and Marketing Linda Rimanich Foa passed away peacefully at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on June 17, 2016 after a long battle with cancer. She is survived by her husband, Conrad, their sons, Justin and Barrett, and grandchildren, Max and Luke. Her abiding interest in others, her incomparable style, and her take no prisoners demeanor, meant that everyone knew that she was ""in the room"". Her always-positive impact on her family and friends will be sorely missed. The stars were already aligning because Linda and Conrad were both born in Wickersham Hospital (across the street from Bloomingdale's); Linda was born there 51 weeks after her future husband. Her family resided in Jamaica Estates, New York City, where she graduated from The Mary Louis Academy. Linda majored in Fashion and Fine Arts at Parsons/NYU. Linda's sense of style, superb writing ability, and natural beauty were a unique combination that was unleashed on the world of design journalism. Linda began her professional career at Fairchild's Home Furnishings Daily and HFN where she was an editor, and penned the still-remembered FYI column. While mothering, she wrote several lead cover articles for New York Magazine, articles for The New York Times Style Section, and co-authored Kids' Stuff, the definitive furnishings guide to children's furniture and home environments [Pantheon/Random House]. In the 1990s, Linda headed and brought Designer's Saturday to prominence; producing a world-renowned annual contract furniture show in New York City that featured over 100 participating showrooms. The food and ambiance offered in the showrooms were even reviewed by Mimi Sheraton in The New York Times. For the past 11+ years, Linda was the Marketing Director of the Architects & Designers building at 150 East 58th Street. She is credited with burnishing the building's ability to attract high-end kitchen, bathroom and furniture showrooms. She contributed to a soaring occupancy rate and was instrumental in partnering with The New York Times to host the building-wide Taste of T foodie event for over a decade. Walking through the building with her, it was obvious that she was loved by tenants and co-workers alike. Linda, along with her spouse, were prominent members of the Lexington Democratic Club. She rose to the party post of District Leader and was a fierce proponent of the Club's role in forwarding and bettering the Democratic agenda. It was with great pleasure that she witnessed the presumptive nomination by the Democratic Party of the first female presidential nominee. The success of her children, Justin [fifth generation owner and CEO of 155 year-old international insurance brokerage firm, Foa & Son] and Barrett (respected, multi-talented lead actor, singer, dancer in two Tony Award-winning Broadway shows, with an eight year series-regular role on CBS's ""NCIS: Los Angeles"") speaks volumes about her exceptional mothering. Linda and her husband, Conrad, did everything together and were rarely apart during their 50 year relationship. A memorial service for Linda will we held at the Unitarian Church of All Souls at 1157 Lexington Avenue (80th Street) on June 28, 2016 at 11:00am. There will be a reception for Linda's friends after the service. 1/3",

He was 84. West and Shapiro, had one of the longest friendships and business relationships in the history of Hollywood. The two boys from the Bronx had known each other since grammar school and then went on to work together for 41 years at personal management/production company Shapiro/West. ""I first met Howie in the schoolyard of Public School 80 in the Bronx when we were eight years old,"" Shapiro said. ""Howie was the new kid at school as he just moved from another Bronx neighborhood. Howie was alone in the schoolyard, sitting on a step near one of the school entrances. I invited him to join me and my friends to play basketball, stickball, curb ball, and touch football. It was love at first sight, and we became best friends since that day. We were partners in buying comic books, we bought our first car together, worked as busboys, and lifeguards/stagehands at the Tamiment summer resort in the Pocono Mountains, where he worked with writers Neil and Danny Simon, choreographer Herb Ross, comedian Dick Shawn, and singer Barbara Cook. It was a great beginning for our showbiz career."" (PS 80 in the Bronx is also the alma mater of Garry and Penny Marshall, Ralph Lauren (nee Ralph Lipschitz), Calvin Klein, and Robert Klein). After graduation from Long Island University and then serving in the Army, West reunited with Shapiro in the William Morris Agency mailroom, and it wasn't long before both began repping talent. West's clients at William Morris included Neil Diamond, Glen Campbell, Anne Murray, Ruth Buzzi, Paul Lynde, Jerry Reed and Greg Garrison (who produced/directed The Dean Martin Show and The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast). He specialized in television packaging, putting together such shows as The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour and The Bobby Darin Show. In 1974, he left the William Morris Agency to help form Shapiro/West. Shapiro recruited West by offering him the presidency of the firm and the parking space closest to the office entrance. West, who also then began repping Marty Feldman, executive produced the comedian's The Last Remake of Beau Geste, which he also developed with the comedy star. He also produced ""In God We Trust,"" which he and Feldman once again developed. In addition to Jerry Seinfeld, Carl Reiner, Peter Bonerz (who was an actor on Newhart before directing multiple episodes of Murphy Brown and Home Improvement), Shapiro/West's client roster included/includes Feldman, Andy Kaufman, director Alan Myerson, Gabe Kaplan, Robert Wuhl, Bill Persky and Sam Denoff (who produced The Dick Van Dyke Show with Reiner and created That Girl for Marlo Thomas), Dick Clair and Jenna McMahon (who wrote for Carol Burnett, created Mama's Family, Facts of Life and It's a Living), Ken Spears & Joe Ruby, Tom Tenowich and Ed Scharlach (""Mork & Mindy""), Sam Bobrick (the prolific playwright who also created NBC's Saved By The Bell and wrote for such classic comedy shows as Get Smart, The Andy Griffith Show, and The Dick Van Dyke Show), and writer Norman Barasch (""Send Me No Flowers"" on Broadway, TV shows ""Rhoda"", ""Benson"", ""Chico & The Man""), and Austin & Irma Kalish (writers for ""All In The Family"", ""Bob Newhart Show"", ""Maude"", etc.), Steve Gordon (writer/director of ""Arthur"" starring Dudley Moore. West also guided the successful career of Bill Lawrence who produced Spin City, Scrubs, Cougar Town. Lawrence's new series ""Undateable"" is in its third season on NBC and the one-hour series Rush Hour (based on the hit film) was picked up by CBS. Together, Shapiro and West were part of the producing team behind the beloved comedy series Seinfeld, for which they won multiple Emmy, Golden Globe and Peabody awards and was named best sitcom of all time in 2012 after a nationwide poll taken by 60 Minutes and Vanity Fair. ""Seinfeld"" ran from 1989 to 1998, leaving at #1 rated show in the country. They also executive produced Andy Kaufman at Carnegie Hall, as well as Kaufman's ABC special, the Paramount feature film ""Summer School"" starring Mark Harmon, and the Universal biopic, Man on the Moon, which was directed by Milos Forman and starred Jim Carrey as Kaufman. West and Shapiro both had cameos in Man on the Moon: Shapiro portrayed comedy club owner Mr. Besserman (a role he had to read for). West play a hard-nosed network executive (Howard didn't have to read), ""he was a natural for the role,"" Shapiro said. They also produced the award- winning documentaries, The Bronx Boys for HBO, and The Bronx Boys Still Playing at 80 for PBS. Shapiro/West is currently working with Seinfeld on the web series Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee. Jerry Seinfeld said ""Howard was doing what he loved until the end. There's nothing better."" But West's true love was Marlene, his wife of 54 years. He is survived by his two children Dayna and Todd, granddaughter, Olivia, and by his great friend George Shapiro.<br><br>",

He was born in Brooklyn, NY and moved to Florida to attend the University of Miami and the University of Miami School of Law where he met his beloved wife Barbara to whom he was married for 60 years. They had two sons, Scott and Gregg, who both followed their father's lead and became lawyers and practiced with him. They were fortunate to have six grandchildren, a constant source of happiness. He knew as a very young man that he was going to be a lawyer and he enjoyed every minute of his career. His favorite place was in a courtroom. His passing will leave a void in the legal community where he was greatly respected by judges, colleagues and opponents alike. As avid supporters of civic and charitable organizations, the Schlesinger family is actively involved in the South Florida community. Mr. Schlesinger served on the Board of Governors of Nova- Southeastern Law Center and served as chairman of the Board of Trustees of Broward Community College. Early on he got involved with Broward Community College because he believed strongly in giving an opportunity for a college education to anyone who wanted one; a building on the Hollywood Campus is named for him. Sheldon J. Schlesinger was one of the most successful personal injury and medical malpractice attorneys in the United States. For over 60 years, he represented individuals and consumers in landmark cases across the nation. He was listed in every edition of the book ""The Best Lawyers in America."" He had, and deserved, a reputation for being one of the best trial attorneys in the United States. The Miami Herald described Shelly as ""The Dean of Broward Civil Litigators."" The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel described him as a ""Bulldog for the Underdog,"" a ""super-lawyer in every sense of the word,"" and ""one of the most powerful personal injury attorneys in the country."" At the conclusion of a lengthy trial where his client emerged victorious, the presiding judge entered a court order describing him as ""one of the most experienced and skilled attorneys which the Florida Bar has to offer,"" and that his ""experience and ability in medical malpractice litigation is exceeded by no one."" Mr. Schlesinger won significant verdicts and settlements in numerous high profile cases. He set national records for plaintiffs' attorneys, including products liability cases against major automotive manufacturers. In 1995, he was part of the landmark legal team that successfully defeated the tobacco industry on behalf of the citizens of Florida. He was one of the founders of the Broward County Trial Lawyers Association and served as its president. He was a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates, one of the nation's most prestigious organizations for plaintiff lawyers. Because of the number of high profile cases he won, he was the subject of numerous interviews and stories in newspapers, magazines and television. He appeared in Time, People, Forbes, Florida Trend, New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. He appeared on CBS 60 Minutes, ABC's 20/20, the Phil Donahue Show, and numerous other national and local television and news programs. Recently, he was inducted into the Trial Lawyer Hall of Fame held at Temple University in Pennsylvania; he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Florida Verdicts Hall of Fame by the Daily Business Review; and he was honored to give a Legacy lecture to his cherished Inner Circle of Advocates.

His passing will leave a void in the legal community where he was greatly respected by judges, colleagues and opponents alike.

Mr. Schlesinger served on the Board of Governors of Nova- Southeastern Law Center and served as chairman of the Board of Trustees of Broward Community College.

For over 60 years, he represented individuals and consumers in landmark cases across the nation. He was listed in every edition of the book ""The Best Lawyers in America.""

Mr. Schlesinger won significant verdicts and settlements in numerous high profile cases. He set national records for plaintiffs' attorneys, including products liability cases against major automotive manufacturers. In 1995, he was part of the landmark legal team that successfully defeated the tobacco industry on behalf of the citizens of Florida. He was one of the founders of the Broward County Trial Lawyers Association and served as its president. He was a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates, one of the nation's most prestigious organizations for plaintiff lawyers. Because of the number of high profile cases he won, he was the subject of numerous interviews and stories in newspapers, magazines and television. He appeared in Time, People, Forbes, Florida Trend, New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. He appeared on CBS 60 Minutes, ABC's 20/20, the Phil Donahue Show, and numerous other national and local television and news programs.

Blank passed away peacefully on December 27, 2014. To all who knew him he was a gentleman and a scholar, a kind man whose intellectual curiosity and knowledge about the world knew no bounds. Son of Louis and Fanny Blank, he was born at home in 1921 in an apartment on the Grand Concourse. Later the family moved to Mt. Vernon, only to lose their house and the family business. While his parents and his brother Seymour and sister Judy moved to Florida so his father could find work, David, already a remarkable student, remained behind in order to complete high school. Later, the family was able to reunite in Mt. Vernon when his father established a second clothing business. From A.B. Davis High School, he went on as a sixteen-year- old to study economics at Columbia University. Money was tight --tuition was $400 and books another $100. But with a $100 scholarship and a summer job with the Department of Agriculture that helped him pay the balance, David was able to ensure there was little financial burden on his family. In June 1941, he graduated, Phi Beta Kappa with Honors in Economics, and when the war broke out, he enlisted. He was assigned to the Third Army in Europe under General George Patton and was ultimately awarded three battle stars. Upon his discharge, and with help from the GI Bill, he returned to Columbia University, and received a Ph.D. in economics in 1950. In the 1950s, Blank's distinguished academic career included teaching at Columbia University, New York University, and the American Institute of Banking, as well as collaborating at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He worked at the Columbia Research Institute for Urban Land Use and Housing Studies and collaborated on numerous articles and books. A 1957 monograph for the National Bureau of Economic Research was written with George J. Stigler, a Nobel Prize winner in Economic Sciences and a key leader with Milton Friedman of the Chicago School of Economics. In 1955, he began a lengthy career at CBS that lasted for almost three decades. His final position was as Vice President, Economics and Research. Over the years, he focused on many varied economic, finance, social and demographic issues such television and violence to election night voter projection. When Blank retired from CBS in 1982, he became a consultant for NBC. In his youth in the late 1930s, the economic necessity that brought about the summer job also helped him develop what would become a lifelong passion. While working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture on a project intended to eradicate the blight of Dutch Elm disease, he acquired a vast knowledge of tree species and a love for them. In 1957, when he and his wife Hilda Schlefstein whom he married in 1948, moved to wooded acreage in Pleasantville, N.Y., they reveled in its beauty. In 2001, several years after his wife had succumbed to a lengthy illness, he moved to the Osborn Retirement Community in Rye, N.Y. There, he enjoyed long walks around its handsome 56 acres. In time, Blank had identified more than 100 tree species on the grounds and a total of more than 1,000 trees. Not only did he map the trees, but he also initiated a program of tagging each tree, and began to give his well-known tree walks that included the story of the rare Dawn Redwood. Today, the Osborne campus is nationally recognized as an Arboretum and nature walks are given a number of times a year. In retirement, he thrived on being surrounded by friends and family, books, and music, and involvement in organizations and foundations that supported issues of interest to him. These issues included womens reproductive rights, a passion that he shared with his wife Hilda, civil liberties, and the state of education. For several years, he presented broad contemporary economic issues to senior citizens in classes he offered at Westchester Community College. He was a man who never tired of learning something new and never tired of living. He will be sorely missed by his daughter Alison Blank, her husband, Jim Murphy, and their children, Michael and Ben, all of whom reside in Maplewood, N.J. 1/3",

He was 77 and had been bravely battling advanced Parkinson's disease for over 16 years. Francis, who was also known as Frank, was born in Montclair, NJ, on November 10, 1937 to the Honorable Frank J. Brunetto, Jr. and Ellen McGowan Brunetto; his father served with distinction as the Municipal Court Judge in Montclair for 37 years. Frank was educated in Montclair and at Kimball Union Academy before attending Michigan State where he was president of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, graduating in 1960. After serving in the US Army, his first job was as a copy writer for Walter Cronkite at CBS News where he also scripted several installments of the Cronkite-narrated CBS series, The Twentieth Century. After CBS, he went on to become the then youngest account supervisor in the history of Hill and Knowlton where he took over responsibility for operations in Nassau and Grand Bahama and played leading roles in bringing major film productions to the Bahamas including the Beatles to film Help, and Sean Connery to film Thunderball. He also directed the press coverage of first royal visit of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip to Grand Bahama, but was most proud of having helped conceive and execute the first annual Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. From Hill and Knowlton, Frank moved on to D'Arcy Advertising where he reimaged the Lufthansa Airlines account, conceiving and executing the Red Baron advertising campaign which was hailed as a watershed transformation of the airline's formerly conservative, regimented public persona. Frank left advertising to follow his entrepreneurial instincts and founded a number of successful media businesses including: Videotape Network which pioneered the production and distribution of the then new technology of video programming to college campuses; The Other Side of the Story which produced and distributed contrarian perspectives on current world events, the reporting of which was then monopolized by the three major news networks, and; Smart Business which pioneered the production of audio tapes on current economic and business issues and won critical acclaim from business editors at the New York Times, International Herald Tribune, Time, and USA Today. Frank also established the Peregrine Media Group, a platform from which he consulted and advised a variety of corporations, trade organizations, government officials, and private individuals on media projects, communications strategies, and writing assignments. He often remarked that his career was graced with the opportunity to work closely with a diverse group of public personalities including, amongst others, William F. Buckley, Jr., Timothy Leary, Arthur Janov, Jean Claude Killy, Edmund Muskie, and Rod Serling. Frank is survived by his sister, Patricia Brunetto Kiernan of Verona, NJ, who is the founder and proprietor of Willing Hearts, a charity consignment store in Caldwell, NJ, a daughter, Kristin Falth Brunetto, and her mother, Lena Falth, both of Chappaqua, NY. He also leaves a devoted group of steadfast friends who rallied an extraordinary effort to support and inspire him in his battle with Parkinson's. Announcements will follow regarding the date of a Memorial Mass to be held at the Immaculate Conception Church in Montclair, NJ, as well as the date for a gathering of friends and family in celebration of the life of Francis McGowan Brunetto to be held at his treasured New York Athletic Club in Manhattan.<br><br>",

Blank passed away peacefully on December 27, 2014. To all who knew him he was a gentleman and a scholar, a kind man whose intellectual curiosity and knowledge about the world knew no bounds. Son of Louis and Fanny Blank, he was born at home in 1921 in an apartment on the Grand Concourse. Later the family moved to Mt. Vernon, only to lose their house and the family business. While his parents and his brother Seymour and sister Judy moved to Florida so his father could find work, David, already a remarkable student, remained behind in order to complete high school. Later, the family was able to reunite in Mt. Vernon when his father established a second clothing business. From A.B. Davis High School, he went on as a sixteen-year- old to study economics at Columbia University. Money was tight --tuition was $400 and books another $100. But with a $100 scholarship and a summer job with the Department of Agriculture that helped him pay the balance, David was able to ensure there was little financial burden on his family. In June 1941, he graduated, Phi Beta Kappa with Honors in Economics, and when the war broke out, he enlisted. He was assigned to the Third Army in Europe under General George Patton and was ultimately awarded three battle stars. Upon his discharge, and with help from the GI Bill, he returned to Columbia University, and received a Ph.D. in economics in 1950. In the 1950s, Blank's distinguished academic career included teaching at Columbia University, New York University, and the American Institute of Banking, as well as collaborating at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He worked at the Columbia Research Institute for Urban Land Use and Housing Studies and collaborated on numerous articles and books. A 1957 monograph for the National Bureau of Economic Research was written with George J. Stigler, a Nobel Prize winner in Economic Sciences and a key leader with Milton Friedman of the Chicago School of Economics. In 1955, he began a lengthy career at CBS that lasted for almost three decades. His final position was as Vice President, Economics and Research. Over the years, he focused on many varied economic, finance, social and demographic issues such television and violence to election night voter projection. When Blank retired from CBS in 1982, he became a consultant for NBC. In his youth in the late 1930s, the economic necessity that brought about the summer job also helped him develop what would become a lifelong passion. While working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture on a project intended to eradicate the blight of Dutch Elm disease, he acquired a vast knowledge of tree species and a love for them. In 1957, when he and his wife Hilda Schlefstein whom he married in 1948, moved to wooded acreage in Pleasantville, N.Y., they reveled in its beauty. In 2001, several years after his wife had succumbed to a lengthy illness, he moved to the Osborn Retirement Community in Rye, N.Y. There, he enjoyed long walks around its handsome 56 acres. In time, Blank had identified more than 100 tree species on the grounds and a total of more than 1,000 trees. Not only did he map the trees, but he also initiated a program of tagging each tree, and began to give his well-known tree walks that included the story of the rare Dawn Redwood. Today, the Osborne campus is nationally recognized as an Arboretum and nature walks are given a number of times a year. In retirement, he thrived on being surrounded by friends and family, books, and music, and involvement in organizations and foundations that supported issues of interest to him. These issues included womens reproductive rights, a passion that he shared with his wife Hilda, civil liberties, and the state of education. For several years, he presented broad contemporary economic issues to senior citizens in classes he offered at Westchester Community College. He was a man who never tired of learning something new and never tired of living. He will be sorely missed by his daughter Alison Blank, her husband, Jim Murphy, and their children, Michael and Ben, all of whom reside in Maplewood, N.J.<br><br>",
