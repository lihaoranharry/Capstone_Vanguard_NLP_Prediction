Baldev Duggal (August 17, 1937 - June 29, 2016), a visionary entrepreneur, who over five decades built several iconic NYC businesses, including Duggal Visual Solutions and The Duggal Greenhouse, passed away peacefully in his sleep early last Wednesday morning, only days after an advance celebration of his upcoming 79th birthday with his family. Duggal was a proud New Yorker and a living manifestation of the American Dream. An immigrant, he came to the United States by himself from India in 1957 with only $200 in his pocket and managed to translate his last name into a global brand in the arts, graphics and media world. Made in India: In 1947, in Duggal's formative years, India won its independence. During the struggles that preceded independence, his father, Biasdev Duggal, an insurance manager, was imprisoned as a local leader for peaceful resistance to British rule. As a boy, Duggal learned a powerful lesson on the power of individuals to make change against the odds. The Land of Opportunity: Duggal arrived in New York Harbor in 1957, alone and with $200 in his pocket to start his new life. Coming from a then small village in India, far from being intimidated by the size and vibrancy of New York City he was energized by it. It began a lifetime love affair with the city he lived in until his death. He managed to get work in photo print shops and as a cameraman for famed NYC television correspondent Gabe Pressman. Whatever barriers existed for young 'third-world' immigrants in the 1950s, he simply couldn't afford to be hindered by them. It wasn't long before he started his own business, Duggal Color Projects. He was hand developing film in a bathtub in a basement apartment in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Soon the legends like Marcel Duchamp, Bert Stern, and Richard Avedon were giving him jobs. His lab was the go-to place for artists in the 1960s. One of his favorite anecdotes of those days was when Andy Warhol's studio once offered to pay him in-kind with original paintings, but he declined as he needed the cash for his struggling small business. The new challenge for Duggal became how to scale his business. Hand-processing film was slow and tedious but was far superior to the automated processes of the day which yielded dull whites. He knew there could be something better and he invented a revolutionary process for film development, the ""dip-and-dunk"" machine, that combined the quality of hand processing with the efficiency and consistency of a mechanical process. This marriage of art and science would be something he would repeat and be known for throughout his life. Vision, Timing and Tenacity: By 1970, his business had grown so much he needed more space. Seeking lower real estate prices, he moved to a 12-story building in Chelsea that he later purchased, in an area that later became 'The Photo District', as other labs and camera shops opened around him to share in the market Duggal was building. At this point, Duggal Color Projects had already expanded into a comprehensive film processing, printing and finishing company that could handle a wide range of jobs for photographers, advertising firms, museums, and corporations. To stay on top, Duggal kept innovating and adding new services for his burgeoning clientele. In the 1980s Duggal saw the potential for Digital services to transform the industry, and he pioneered early electronic retouching services and became the first commercial lab to feature drum scanning technology. While that business took a long time to grow, his early investments gave him a head start and experience no one else had. In the last decades, while many others, including Kodak, failed to make the transition to Digital, Duggal was already an established industry leader with a litany of pioneering firsts. Along the way, Duggal had to ride out many economic downturns, 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Events that would take him and his Company to the brink, but he embodied the toughness New Yorkers are famous for and kept coming back stronger. Today Duggal Visual Solutions, Inc. employs over 350 dedicated employees and boasts over 250,000 square feet of production space in New York City. Green Fields: Never one to stand still, in his 70s, Duggal began to start other businesses. Notably 'The Duggal Greenhouse', formerly a dilapidated warehouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard he had rehabilitated with an eco-friendly design, and transformed into the pre-eminent event space in New York. The huge, column free space with tremendous views of the New York City skyline has attracted the likes of Beyonce, Nike, Christian Dior and CNN, which recently hosted a Democratic Party Debate at the facility. Duggal's interest in Green Technology as both an opportunity and a way to make a positive impact led him to start Lumisolair. The Man: Baldev Duggal was an upbeat charismatic man, always scanning the horizon for what came next. He took on each day with boundless energy and an optimism, which challenged individuals and teams to achieve more than they believed possible. His dreams found their ideal home in New York City, a place that allowed him to experiment without restraint and bring together his love for art and science into a platform that fundamentally transformed how artists and marketers would communicate with the world. Baldev Duggal is survived by his three children Sue, Dave and Michael and eight grandchildren. He is also survived by his brother Sukhdev Duggal.<br><br>"

171,,"Paid Notice: Deaths DUGGAL, BALDEV",http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E6DA113AF934A35754C0A9609D8B63,"DUGGAL--Baldev. The Passing of a Visionary New York Businessman. Baldev Duggal (August 17, 1937 - June 29, 2016), a visionary entrepreneur, who over five decades built several iconic NYC businesses, including Duggal Visual Solutions and The Duggal Greenhouse, passed away peacefully in his sleep early last Wednesday morning, only days after an advance celebration of his upcoming 79th birthday with his family. Duggal was a proud New Yorker and a living manifestation of the American Dream. An immigrant, he came to the United States by himself from India in 1957 with only $200 in his pocket and managed to translate his last name into a global brand in the arts, graphics and media world. Made in India: In 1947, in Duggal's formative years, India won its independence. During the struggles that preceded independence, his father, Biasdev Duggal, an insurance manager, was imprisoned as a local leader for peaceful resistance to British rule. As a boy, Duggal learned a powerful lesson on the power of individuals to make change against the odds. The Land of Opportunity: Duggal arrived in New York Harbor in 1957, alone and with $200 in his pocket to start his new life. Coming from a then small village in India, far from being intimidated by the size and vibrancy of New York City he was energized by it. It began a lifetime love affair with the city he lived in until his death. He managed to get work in photo print shops and as a cameraman for famed NYC television correspondent Gabe Pressman. Whatever barriers existed for young 'third-world' immigrants in the 1950s, he simply couldn't afford to be hindered by them. It wasn't long before he started his own business, Duggal Color Projects. He was hand developing film in a bathtub in a basement apartment in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Soon the legends like Marcel Duchamp, Bert Stern, and Richard Avedon were giving him jobs. His lab was the go-to place for artists in the 1960s. One of his favorite anecdotes of those days was when Andy Warhol's studio once offered to pay him in-kind with original paintings, but he declined as he needed the cash for his struggling small business. The new challenge for Duggal became how to scale his business. Hand-processing film was slow and tedious but was far superior to the automated processes of the day which yielded dull whites. He knew there could be something better and he invented a revolutionary process for film development, the ""dip-and-dunk"" machine, that combined the quality of hand processing with the efficiency and consistency of a mechanical process. This marriage of art and science would be something he would repeat and be known for throughout his life. Vision, Timing and Tenacity: By 1970, his business had grown so much he needed more space. Seeking lower real estate prices, he moved to a 12-story building in Chelsea that he later purchased, in an area that later became 'The Photo District', as other labs and camera shops opened around him to share in the market Duggal was building. At this point, Duggal Color Projects had already expanded into a comprehensive film processing, printing and finishing company that could handle a wide range of jobs for photographers, advertising firms, museums, and corporations. To stay on top, Duggal kept innovating and adding new services for his burgeoning clientele. In the 1980s Duggal saw the potential for Digital services to transform the industry, and he pioneered early electronic retouching services and became the first commercial lab to feature drum scanning technology. While that business took a long time to grow, his early investments gave him a head start and experience no one else had. In the last decades, while many others, including Kodak, failed to make the transition to Digital, Duggal was already an established industry leader with a litany of pioneering firsts. Along the way, Duggal had to ride out many economic downturns, 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Events that would take him and his Company to the brink, but he embodied the toughness New Yorkers are famous for and kept coming back stronger. Today Duggal Visual Solutions, Inc. employs over 350 dedicated employees and boasts over 250,000 square feet of production space in New York City. Green Fields: Never one to stand still, in his 70s, Duggal began to start other businesses. Notably 'The Duggal Greenhouse', formerly a dilapidated warehouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard he had rehabilitated with an eco-friendly design, and transformed into the pre-eminent event space in New York. The huge, column free space with tremendous views of the New York City skyline has attracted the likes of Beyonce, Nike, Christian Dior and CNN, which recently hosted a Democratic Party Debate at the facility. Duggal's interest in Green Technology as both an opportunity and a way to make a positive impact led him to start Lumisolair. The Man: Baldev Duggal was an upbeat charismatic man, always scanning the horizon for what came next. He took on each day with boundless energy and an optimism, which challenged individuals and teams to achieve more than they believed possible. His dreams found their ideal home in New York City, a place that allowed him to experiment without restraint and bring together his love for art and science into a platform that fundamentally transformed how artists and marketers would communicate with the world. Baldev Duggal is survived by his three children Sue, Dave and Michael and eight grandchildren. He is also survived by his brother Sukhdev Duggal. 1/3"

He was 71. Since 2009, Richard fought valiantly against a debilitating and rare neurological disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Along with his family's foundation, he spent the latter part of his life funding and actively engaging the international medical community to launch a bold research effort to combat PSP and discover a cure. His significant investment into brain research and neurodegenerative diseases has been called transformational; the goal is to find a treatment for brain-related diseases. Richard is survived by his wife Darla Moore and three children from a prior marriage, Courtney Rainwater, Todd Rainwater and Matthew Rainwater as well as Richard's brother, Walter Rainwater, sister-in-law, Lori and niece, Kelley. He also leaves behind hundreds of friends, business colleagues and people Richard mentored and launched into entrepreneurship as well as the numerous causes he funded and the countless individuals who were deeply touched by his generosity. ""A person's legacy is truly who they leave behind,"" said Darla Moore, ""and Richard populated this country with extraordinary talent that he recognized when they were very young.

Justice Garibaldi was born November 26, 1934, in Jersey City to Dr. Louis and Marie S. Garibaldi. As an only child, she lived most of her life in Hudson County. The Garibaldis raised their daughter with a strong belief in equal opportunity for women and encouraged her to pursue a nontraditional career path. She was a pioneer and role model to so many. She is survived by loving cousins, adoring godchildren and many cherished friends and colleagues. As a child, Justice Garibaldi attended Stevens Hoboken Academy through 12th grade. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in economics and a political science minor from Connecticut College (New London, CT) in 1956. With an intent to follow in her grandfather's footsteps and attend business school, Justice Garibaldi learned first-hand women weren't accepted. Instead, she enrolled in Columbia Law School as a pathway into the business world and graduated in 1959. In 1963, Justice Garibaldi earned her Master of Laws degree in tax law from New York University School of Law. She was a member of the New Jersey, New York, and District of Columbia Bars and the first woman to serve as president of the New Jersey State Bar Association. Justice Garibaldi began her legal career with the New York Regional Counsel in the Internal Revenue Service. She received extensive trial experience in Tax Court. The Hatch Act restricted government employees from political speech-making and article-writing which ultimately caused Justice Garibaldi to make her next career move. She briefly worked at a firm now known as Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti (Riker, Danzig)-within three years she was made a partner which was virtually unheard of at that time. While at Riker, Danzig, Justice Garibaldi also served as a municipal court judge in Weehawken, NJ, from 1973 to 1975, writing the majority of opinion in several cases affecting women. Justice Garibaldi was introduced to Republican Thomas H. Kean by a Riker, Danzig partner. This ultimately led Justice Garibaldi to serve as co-chair of his gubernatorial campaign. Once elected, Governor Thomas H. Kean nominated Justice Garibaldi to the New Jersey Supreme Court. In 1982, Justice Garibaldi became the first woman appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court- she served as Associate Justice of New Jersey's highest court until she retired in 2000. She authored more than 225 opinions while on the Supreme Court and was known for her advocacy of complementary dispute resolution. She chaired the Supreme Court's committee on that subject, and in 1998, the American Inns of Court Foundation established the Justice Marie L. Garibaldi American Inn of Court for Alternative Dispute Resolution. Justice Garibaldi was the recipient of many awards, including the Medal of Excellence from the Columbia University School of Law. She received honorary degrees from St. John's University Law School, Seton Hall University Law School, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Drew University, Upsala College, St. Peter's College, Caldwell College, and the College of Saint Elizabeth. Justice Garibaldi joined the Hackensack University Medical Center in 2001 and served as vice chair of Hackensack University Medical Center's Board of Governors. She also served on the Hackensack University Health Network's Board of Trustees, as chair of the Executive Compensation Committee and on the Hackensack University Medical Center Foundation's Board of Trustees. She chaired the Hudson Riverfront Performing Arts Center and served as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Italian American Foundation. Justice Garibaldi also served as a director of Crown Holdings, Inc. from 2000 to 2007. She also served as a member of the New Jersey Council on Local Mandates. In addition, Justice Garibaldi served as the secretary of the American Association Order of Malta, USA and executive vice president of the American Society of the Italian Legions of Merit. She also served as a director of the State Chamber of Commerce, New Jersey Bell Telephone Co., and the Washington Savings Bank. She also was a trustee of St. Peter's College. Justice Garibaldi truly enjoyed traveling, reading mysteries, and dinner and dancing with friends. She will be greatly missed by friends, loved ones and colleagues. Justice Marie L. Garibaldi was predeceased by her parents-her father, Dr. Louis Garibaldi passed away in 1975 and her mother, Marie S. Garibaldi passed away in 2013 at the age of 103. The funeral will be on Thursday, January 21 at 9am from the Leber Funeral Home in Union City then to St. Augustine Church where, at 10am, a Mass will be offered. Visitation will be on Tuesday, January 19 from 7 to 9pm, Wednesday, January 20 from 2 to 5pm and 7 to 9pm.

He was 71. Since 2009, Richard fought valiantly against a debilitating and rare neurological disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Along with his family's foundation, he spent the latter part of his life funding and actively engaging the international medical community to launch a bold research effort to combat PSP and discover a cure. His significant investment into brain research and neurodegenerative diseases has been called transformational; the goal is to find a treatment for brain-related diseases. Richard is survived by his wife Darla Moore and three children from a prior marriage, Courtney Rainwater, Todd Rainwater and Matthew Rainwater as well as Richard's brother, Walter Rainwater, sister-in-law, Lori and niece, Kelley. He also leaves behind hundreds of friends, business colleagues and people Richard mentored and launched into entrepreneurship as well as the numerous causes he funded and the countless individuals who were deeply touched by his generosity. ""A person's legacy is truly who they leave behind,"" said Darla Moore, ""and Richard populated this country with extraordinary talent that he recognized when they were very young. Not many people are generous with their time when mentoring young people. Richard was the exception."" Richard has not made any public appearances since 2010. His son, Matthew said his father was the personification of heroism as he battled the illness. ""There is an extraordinary untold story about his heroism and bravery as the symptoms worsened. He was determined to embrace every available moment with his loved ones, and he resolved to establish a robust platform for long term research into tauopathies such as PSP and Alzheimer's Disease,"" said Matthew. ""It's another example of him actually 'willing' something into reality."" Richard's life was undoubtedly extended because of the extraordinary care he received over the last five and a half years. The family is deeply appreciative of Stephen Boyd, Jerry Harper, Robert Patterson, Eric Thompson, Barry Less, Norman Finley, Rick Castle, Scott Rhode and Bonnie Dears. Their loving, professional and attentive care added much quality to Richard's life. Former President George W. Bush partnered with Richard and Rusty Rose in 1989 to purchase the Texas Rangers MLB club. Mr. Bush issued a statement about his friend. ""I was so saddened to learn that my friend Richard Rainwater died this weekend. Richard had a brilliant mind and a generous heart.

Richard's ""fun"" came on the golf course, and he was once a partner in the famed Pebble Beach Golf Club. He also invented a new form of friendly competitive golf for rounds with friends; the game was labeled as ""Two Ball."" A self-described fitness fanatic, Richard, prior to the onset of his illness, was an avid marathon runner. He also loved motorsports and sponsored cars, most notably a 1957 ""muscle car,"" in competitions. Born June 15, 1944 to Walter J. Rainwater Sr. a wholesale grocer, and Regina Dieb Rainwater, a J.C.
