The ripple effect showed up this week in a number of corporate earnings reports. Corning said on Tuesday that its quarterly profit surged 41 percent, in part because of rising sales of its unusually strong Gorilla Glass, which is used in smartphone displays. Gorilla Glass, which is used in roughly 200 million mobile devices, produced about $250 million in revenue for Corning in 2010. James B. Flaws, the company's chief financial officer, told analysts that Gorilla Glass could generate $1 billion in revenue this year."

From a base in East Anglia during World War II, 19 year old Howard Sloan flew 33 missions over Germany. His B-24 was named ""The Stork Club."" When praised for his bravery, he would invariably respond: ""Was there a choice?"" Cheers erupted from a crowd on the beach when, piloting his plane home to the states after the war, he dipped his wings over the Inwood Country Club. Mr. Sloan was born in New York City on March 20, 1924. He graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Pawling Preparatory School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, Class of '45W. He and his late wife, Sonny, along with George and Barbara Bush, were the only two married couples on campus. Dreams of business school were dashed by financial necessity and he joined his father's insurance company, Harris, Sloan and Finn. Characteristically, he turned the experience into a colorful one, representing clients such as Restaurant Associates; Richard Burton, who dispatched him to Rome to deliver a diamond he'd bought at auction for Elizabeth Taylor, or Cartier to present a love bracelet to Valentino, who insisted Howard personally fasten it on his wrist. He became an art insurer, developing great interest and knowledge of art in the process, befriending numerous artists and inspiring a lifetime of collecting: Mayan and PreColumbian sculpture, works by artists as diverse as Giacometti and Bill King, Henry Moore and Lindner. He acquired an art gallery, Multiples, for his wife, Sonny, and Marian Goodman to run. In 1990, he was invited by his friend and mentor, Charles Wohlstetter, to become a partner in the latter's acquisitions of hundreds of independent telephone companies from Alaska to California. They formed Continental Telephone, later known as Contel, in 1962. The company then agreed to be acquired by GTE, a combination that created the nation's largest local telephone company. Sloan remained on the Board of GTE until it was restructured as Verizon. In 1968, an American syndicate acquired an 18th century chateau in Bordeaux with Wohlstetter and Sloan installed as new owners. Chateau Bouscaut was the second most beautiful vineyard in Bordeaux, Sloan proclaimed, second, he said, because he didn't want to boast. Among the many American guests who flocked to visit, his favorite was Mary Lindsay, whom he overheard saying to her husband, then mayor of NYC, ""John, if I have to see one more vineyard, I'll kill myself."" To Sloan's eternal regret, Bouscat was sold in 1980. Mayor Lindsay brought Sloan onto the board of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1984. At that time, according to Andre Bishop, current artistic director, ""Nobody would give you a nickel for the Beaumont."" It is now one of the leading theatrical companies in New York, if not the world. Mr. Sloan served on the Board until his death on Thursday. In 1977, Sloan joined the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center, of which he was Chairman from 1993 to 2000, nominating his successor, Howard Milstein. In January 2013, a congressional extension prepared by Representative Carolyn Maloney in recognition of Mr. Sloan's 15 years of distinguished service and dedication to NYBC's mission, was entered into the congressional record. She cited his humanitarian status and commended his leadership and tireless advocacy. For several years, he presided as Chairman of Northside Center for Child Development, founded by Kenneth and Mamie Clarke, earning a colleague's recent comment, ""There was a time this place wouldn't have existed without Howard Sloan."" He and his wife are to be honored for their dedication to Northside at a gala in May 2017. Howard Sloan died of kidney failure in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on January 21, 2016.

The company's 42.1 million customers will continue to pay 5 cents a phone number each month for regulatory fees in the United States, a company spokesman, Jeffrey Nelson, said. The reduction will begin with billing cycles next week, Verizon Wireless said. Sprint, the nation's third-largest cellphone carrier, lowered its monthly regulatory fee rate to 25 cents from 40 cents on Nov. 1. Verizon Wireless, which is owned by Verizon Communications and Vodafone, has been collecting about $15 million a month with its fee. Under a November 2003 rule by the Federal Communications Commission, mobile phone users can keep their numbers when they switch providers. Verizon Wireless, which is based in Bedminster, N.J., has said about three customers switch to its service and keep their phone numbers for every one who leaves for another provider."

The new app was created during a 24-hour ''hackathon'' this month with engineers from Facebook and representatives from the advertising agency R/GA, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, at Facebook's Manhattan headquarters.

Rolling Rock's volume has fallen 25 percent in the last two years, an analyst at UBS Securities, Caroline Levy, said in research note.

The attorneys and staff of Proskauer Rose, LLP, mourn the passing of Howard N. Lefkowitz, a senior partner in Proskauer's Corporate Department. We have lost not only a colleague and a friend but also a lawyer's lawyer who was known for his scholarship and pioneering spirit. In the 43 years Howard worked at Proskauer, he developed an impressive and diverse practice. A visionary in the emerging field of private equity, which would evolve into one of the firm's most active practice areas, he represented institutional investors-including Verizon, JPMorgan and others-in their investments in private equity funds that totaled in the billions. Nationally recognized for his work in partnership and limited liability company law, Howard authored the New York Limited Liability Company Forms and Practice Manual and co-authored Transactional Lawyers Deskbook: Advising Business Entities. He had extensive experience with alternative investment vehicles, and he lectured frequently on limited partnerships, limited liability companies and fiduciary obligations. In 2006, the American Bar Association presented Howard with the Martin I. Lubaroff Award in recognition of his work on partnership law. Howard, known for his love of the law, was a tremendous resource to his colleagues, who relied on his deep knowledge, particularly of New York law and Delaware partnership issues. As his friend and colleague Bruce Lieb remembers, Howard knew the answers to questions that many of us did not realize were questions. Howard retired in 2006 but continued to practice. He spoke and wrote frequently, and he contributed his professional time to organizations including the Private Investment Fund Forum, the ABA and the TriBar Opinion Committee. An expert on wine as well as the law, Howard enjoyed an extensive wine collection and contributed articles to food and wine magazines. Howard received his B.A. from Cornell University and his law degree from Columbia University Law School, where he was a Kent Scholar and an editor of the Columbia Law Review.

Howard graduated Cornell University where he met Midge. Served as an officer in the US Navy in the destroyer fleet at Newport, RI, and graduated from Columbia Law School, where he became an editor of the Law Review and a Kent Scholar. Howard practiced corporate and partnership law at Proskauer, Rose, Goetz and Mendelsohn (now Proskauer Rose) his entire career of over 40 years, retiring as a senior partner in 2005.

The hall, opened in 2001 as part of the $265 million Kimmel Center in Philadelphia, has a ''low level of remembrance,'' and a ''relatively low level of impact of the orchestral sound,'' the design firm Artec said in its study, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported yesterday. The report said ''enormous technical difficulties (and cost)'' would be involved in repairing the flaws. The newspaper also reported that the Philadelphia Orchestra is in talks with a small Finnish label, Ondine, to distribute a series of albums that the orchestra would record itself during live performances. EMI dropped the orchestra from its last major recording contract in 1996, amid widespread retrenchment in the classical music industry.

4727,,Audiovox Workers Dodge a Big Bullet,http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E3DD1730F931A2575AC0A9629C8B63,"WHEN the Audiovox Corporation, the Hauppauge electronics company known for everything from car stereos to flat-screen television sets, sells off its cellphone operations later this year, nothing earthshaking is expected to happen. The subsidiary's 269 employees are expected to show up the morning after the sale, slide into their same desks, make their calls and carry out their assigned duties as if nothing, or at least very little, has happened. After nearly two decades distributing other companies' cellphones to Verizon, Sprint, Nextel and their predecessors, in June Audiovox announced a $165 million deal to sell its cellphone subsidiary, the Audiovox Communications Corporation, to UTStarcom of Alameda, Calif."

The friend, Irene Dische, went on to become an acclaimed novelist in Germany -- her wonderful story ''Berlin Snowfall'' first appeared in The New Yorker -- and Ms. Mann, who now starts her 15th season as artistic director of the McCarter Theater in Princeton, began a career that has won her four Obies, a Peabody, a Christopher and the prestigious Hull-Warriner award, presented by Edward Albee, among other honors."

An art historian and a chemistry professor argue over the authenticity and value of a statue in this new drama by the scientist and playwright Carl Djerassi (1:30).

The 1980 cult roller disco film about a Greek muse sent to earth goes Broadway -- and it's about time. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CORAM BOY' Set in 18th-century England, this melodrama about imperiled orphans is big and broad but not particularly deep. With a cast of 40, an orchestra in the pit and bursts of choral music (Handel, mostly) decorating the proceedings, it is tastefully splashy and certainly impressive, but less emotionally engaging than you might hope (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BETROTHED' Rachel Dickstein weds dance and spoken drama in a distinctive theatrical language. The marriages in this lovely and uneven work are less convincing: aiming to depict women's views about matrimony, this piece, based on three dissimilar short stories, actually depicts marriage as an imprisoning convention from which all three heroines escape. It's no accident that the first part of this triptych, based on Jhumpa Lahiri's story ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar,'' provides the defining image of the work as a whole: wreathed in a haze of (implied) incense and saffron, this lovely sequence is the strongest of the evening (1:20). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DAUGHTER OF A CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY' A standard-issue solo play about a fascinating Cuban family (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE RECeiPT' A lost bar receipt provides a one-way ticket to bedlam in a clever and diverting show that mirrors the idiosyncrasies of modern life as two young archaeologists study a ''lost'' city and postulate on a day in the life of one of its inhabitants (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway * 'HAMLET' Gorilla Rep specializes in outdoor performances of Shakespeare; this workshop is an indoor performance of an outdoor performance, which removes the gimmick and leaves, simply, good theater. The strong cast revolves around note-perfect portrayals of Claudius and Gertrude (Elizabeth McGuire is particularly fine); of the Polonius family (Al Twanmo plays the patriarch as a kind of insurance salesman battling forgetfulness); and, finally, of Hamlet, which Jacob H. Knoll pulls off as an angry young Dane. Christopher Carter Sanderson, the director, shows that the play's the thing, indoors or out (3:00). Roy Arias Theater Center at Times Square Arts Center, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton. (Midgette) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BAD BLOOD (MALASANGRE)' A wife is offered a lucrative job in Texas; her husband moves with her from Puerto Rico but rails against the condition of being a Latino in the United States. Presented in Spanish and English on different nights, this play by Roberto Ramos Perea is full of ideas and anger, but the political fury of the husband is not, in the English version, completely borne out by his characterization, and you can see the charting of the play a little too clearly between the lines (2:30). Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 354-1293; closes on Sunday. (Midgette) 'BEYOND THERAPY' This Christopher Durang play is still pretty funny, and all the more interesting because it is performed in American Sign Language by New York Deaf Theater. Unobtrusive speaking actors provide the dialogue for the benefit of nonsigners, but in the production's best moments they're hardly needed, so animated are the actors and their hands (1:45.) Actors Theater Workshop, 145 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger) 'COUPLES' An evening of eight one-acts offers an update on the battle of the sexes. Some skits work better than others, but each has a kernel of conflict and flashes of humor. Likewise, some characters are more fully drawn, while others border on stereotype. The best of the two-handers, however, is both funny and poignant (1:40). WorkShop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, fourth floor, (212) 695-4173; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'ON THE VERGE' An amusing revival of Eric Overmyer's play about three Victoria-era ladies who set out, armed with parasols and machetes, to explore a terra incognita. As they ''whack the bushes'' into virgin territory, they soon discover they are traveling into the future (2:00). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 777-4280; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'REALISM' and 'JUMP!' The stately Jean Cocteau Repertory (now known as the Exchange) gets a hipster makeover with two foul-mouthed and aggressive new provocations from Britain (1:30 each). Kirk Theater, 420 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) * 'WEST MOON STREET' Rob Urbinati's adaptation of Oscar Wilde's short story ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' delightfully mines a comedy of manners, a meditation on premarital fear, out of a clever mystery of fate. The performances, one and all, are first-rate (2:00). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'CASTING ABOUT' (No rating, 86 minutes) The documentary filmmaker Barry J. Hershey (''The Empty Mirror'') has created this record of casting calls for lead actresses in a dramatic feature that he wrote but has yet to direct: a seemingly Hemingwayesque drama involving a wounded combat photographer, a nun, a dancer and a painter's model. ''Casting About'' is a solid documentary about how art is made but it is also an unnerving inquiry into power relationships between filmmakers and performers and, more pointedly, between men and women. (Matt Zoller Seitz) THE CONDEMNED' (R, 100 minutes) This simple-minded vehicle for the wrestling star Steve Austin follows a bunch of muscle-bound lowlifes as they fight to the death for the benefit of an Internet reality show. Leaden and inept, the movie fails to deliver even the action goods, presenting every fight scene in such quaking, extreme close-up that it's difficult to tell who's pummeling whom. Fortunately, the language of pain is universal. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden) 'DELTA FARCE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) In his second vehicle Larry the Cable Guy takes greater risks, sharing significant screen time with two co-stars (his ''Blue Collar Comedy'' colleague Bill Engvall and D J Qualls) and asking viewers to accept him as a soldier and romantic leading man. When he and his buds are plunked down in Mexico en route to Iraq and liberate a village plagued by marauders, a metaphor for the war proves utterly brain-dead. For starters, where's the oil? (Andy Webster) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'THE EX' (PG-13, 89 minutes) The best jokes in this scattershot screwball satire -- about the cutthroat workplace, job insecurity, upward mobility, political correctness, yuppie marital tensions, and the disabled -- have claws that leave scratches. (Holden) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP ALONE' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Taiwanese, Malay, Mandarin and Bengali) A dreamy, melancholy tale of three-way desire, shot in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and imagined by the director Tsai Ming-Liang with his usual blend of sensuality and formal rigor. (Scott) 'IN THE LAND OF WOMEN' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This mopey comedy is the film equivalent of a sensitive emo band with one foot in alternative rock and the other in the squishy pop mainstream. The movie would like to think of itself as a softer, fuzzier ''Garden State.'' (Holden) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) 'LUCKY YOU' (PG-13, 124 minutes) Eric Bana plays a poker player with daddy issues (Robert Duvall is his dad), and Drew Barrymore is an aspiring singer who catches his eye in this tepid Las Vegas romance. It's not terrible, just content to break even. (Scott) 'MEET THE ROBINSONS' (G, 93 minutes) Actually, if you see them coming, run in the other direction. (Scott) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) 'PROVOKED' (No rating, 113 minutes) Holding fast to the movie-of-the-week formula perfected by Lifetime Television, Jag Mundhra's overly restrained drama is based on the true story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, a London-based Punjabi housewife who torched her sleeping husband in 1989 after suffering a decade of abuse. Unfortunately, by keeping its inflammatory subject matter at arm's length, ''Provoked'' does exactly the same to its audience. (Catsoulis) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Rachel Saltz) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'THE TREATMENT' (No rating, 86 minutes) Oren Rydavsky's adaptation of the Daniel Menaker novel about love and psychoanalysis in New York has its heart and head in the right place, but not much else, including its sympathetic stars, Chris Eigeman, Famke Janssen and Ian Holm. (Dargis) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series JEAN GENET ON FILM (Monday and Tuesday) This French writer, radical and colorful ex-criminal is represented by two of his works adapted for film: Christopher Miles's 1974 version of ''The Maids,'' starring Glenda Jackson and Susannah York (Monday), and Tony Richardson's ''Mademoiselle'' (1966), based on a Genet story as touched up by Marguerite Duras (Tuesday). BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) JULES AND JIM (Today through Sunday) François Truffaut's New Wave classic, about two best friends (Oskar Werner and Henri Serre) who fall in love with the same spritely woman (Jeanne Moreau) on the eve of World War I, is the designated ''Weekend Classic'' this week at the IFC Center. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $11. (Kehr) ALLAN KING (Tonight through Thursday) A continuing retrospective devoted to one of Canada's most accomplished documentary-makers, who is not to be confused with his near-namesake, the comedian Alan King. This is unlikely for anyone who has seen the searing film ''A Married Couple,'' Mr. King's 1969 cinéma-verité study of a marriage in crisis, which is screening tonight. ''The Dragon's Egg: Making Peace on the Wreckage of the Twentieth Century'' (1999), screening tomorrow, concerns the uneasy relationship between native Estonians and the Russians imported into their country by Stalin. ''Dying at Grace'' (2003), one of Mr. King's most recent films, is an intimate portrait of five terminal patients in a Toronto Salvation Army hospital (Wednesday and Thursday). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) LEE MARVIN: THE COOLEST LETHAL WEAPON (Today through Thursday) Week 2 of a retrospective devoted to Marvin, a silver-haired ex-marine who became one of the last great movie stars. Highlights this week include ''The Spikes Gang,'' a rarely screened 1974 coming-of-age film directed by the perennially underestimated Richard Fleischer and featuring Marvin as a wounded outlaw who takes three teenagers under his wing (tonight and tomorrow); Robert Aldrich's 1973 Darwinian duke-out ''Emperor of the North Pole'' (Saturday and Tuesday); and, for the truly fearless, a brand new print of Joshua Logan's insanely misconceived musical ''Paint Your Wagon'' (Sunday), with a talk-singing Marvin joining the nonsinging Jean Seberg and the barely verbal Clint Eastwood in a frontier ménage-à-trois. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. LAURIE ANDERSON (Tonight) Ms. Anderson's entrancing performances weave coolly surrealistic songs and reflective monologues with a witty, seamless dream logic. She unveils a new piece as part of David Bowie's High Line Festival. At 7:30, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com or highlinefestival.com; $37. (Ben Sisario) JOSEPH ARTHUR (Wednesday) Romance, despair and the struggle for faith intermingle in Mr. Arthur's songs, which can float in a gorgeous acoustic reverie or flare up in electrified anger. With Stars of Track and Field. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) DAN BERN (Tuesday) With a nasal sing-speak that recalls the young Bob Dylan, Dan Bern offers smooth folk-rock and a world-weary cynicism. (''There's nothing innocent about a newborn babe,'' he sings, ''that a few years here can't cure.'') At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $16. (Sisario) JIM CAMPILONGO ELECTRIC TRIO (Monday and Thursday) A well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band, the Little Willies, Mr. Campilongo has had a Monday night residency at the Living Room forever. Also on the bill this week is Mike Viola, whose strident power-pop is laced with jagged wit. At 8 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; no cover. Mr. Campilongo's trio also plays on Thursday at 8 p.m. at Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. (Sisario) * VINICIO CAPOSSELA (Tuesday) Calling himself an ''enchanter,'' Mr. Capossela, one of the cleverest and most eccentric musicians in Italy, spins enigmatic fantasies of both skid row Americana and mythological Italy in a grittily elegant cabaret-jazz style that recalls Tom Waits and Paolo Conte. He makes his American debut at Joe's Pub with a band that will include the guitarist Marc Ribot, a Waits collaborator who has appeared on Mr. Capossela's records as well. At 7:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) CITIZEN COPE (Sunday) Clarence Greenwood, a k a Citizen Cope, is the umpteenth singer-songwriter to use hip-hop beats and drawled, rap-sung vocals in search of novelty. With Soulive, a guitar-organ-drums group from Woodstock, N.Y., whose hip-hop-spiked jams pay groovy homage to 1960s soul-jazz and to the funk of Sly Stone and Stevie Wonder. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) COCOROSIE (Tomorrow) As CocoRosie, the Casady sisters, Sierra and Bianca, make a swirling psychodrama out of hints of trip-hop, chirping crickets and cooed Billie Holiday-ish vocals. For this concert they will be accompanied by teenage poets presented by UrbanWord NYC, an organization that offers free writing workshops for young people. At 7:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Sisario) DEVIN THE DUDE (Tonight) This Houston rapper, a raunchy but self-deprecating comedian with a mellow flow, has lingered on the fringes of fame since making an appearance on Dr. Dre's album ''2001,'' released eight years ago. He might learn a lesson from Snoop Dogg, André 3000 and the other big names who have guest spots on his new album, ''Waitin' to Inhale'' (Rap-a-Lot): nobody becomes a rap star by being laid-back, man. With Bavu Blakes, Grit Boys, Surreal, DJ Kutz, Gator and DJ Rapid Ric. At 10, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) * FROG EYES (Tonight and tomorrow night) One of the quickly multiplying side projects of members of the Canadian indie-arty band Wolf Parade (see also Handsome Furs, below), Frog Eyes sets Carey Mercer's frantic, David Bowie-like vocals against even more frantic keyboards and guitars, creating the melody-overload soundtrack to life in fast-forward. With Alex Delivery and Chris Garneau. Tonight at 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. Tomorrow night at 8, Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $10. (Sisario) * BEBEL GILBERTO (Tuesday and Wednesday) Bossa nova becomes a cool drink of electronics-infused bubbly in the songs of Ms. Gilberto, who, like her father, João Gilberto, makes her music as weightless as it is delicious. With Federico Aubele. At 7:30 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $25. (Sisario) * HANDSOME FURS (Wednesday and Thursday) ''What we had don't mean a thing'' may not be the kind of lyric you'd expect from an engaged couple. But as Handsome Furs, Dan Boeckner of Wolf Parade and his fiancée, Alexei Perry, play bleak, hollow dirges propped up by bluesy guitar and spare electronics. It's darkly beautiful and has a ring of honesty, but still, can you imagine the honeymoon? With TK Webb on Wednesday and Sam Jayne on Thursday. At 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) HEAVEN AND HELL (Tomorrow) Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio in place of Ozzy Osbourne. Again. Which means it's effectively 1980 and not very exciting. Again. Come early for the opening acts: Megadeath and Machinehead. At 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 203-2500, artscenter.com; $29.25 to $59.25. (Sisario) * JESUS AND MARY CHAIN (Monday and Tuesday) In the mid-'80s, William and Jim Reid of this Scottish band proved that to make so-called revolutionary rock all you need is a Beach Boys chord progression, dark waves of feedback and a whole lot of slouch. But to have a legacy -- the kind that makes people buy pricey tickets to a reunion concert, like this one -- you also need durable songs, and if the Reids' nihilistic bonbons (''Just Like Honey,'' ''Darklands'') were never hits exactly, they remain paragons of melodic economy, disfigured by noise. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) JUCIFER (Tuesday) For a two-member group -- Amber Valentine on guitar and vocals, Edgar Livengood on drums -- Jucifer makes a mighty noise with its songs about death and desolation. It blasts its way through power-chorded mayhem, slow or at punk speeds, topped by Ms. Valentine's airy voice. With Object and Skeleton Breath. At 7 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $10. (Jon Pareles) TALIB KWELI (Tonight) This socially conscious Brooklyn rapper, the former partner of Mos Def in the seminal '90s group Black Star, is interested in much more than bling. With a hard-nosed, staccato style, he rhymes about ghetto entropy and geopolitics: ''I wanna write the songs to right the wrongs.'' At 11, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $35. (Sisario) MARTINA McBRIDE (Tonight) Nobody delivers a heavy-handed ''social issue'' song like Ms. McBride, whose soaring country-rock can make numbers about battered women (''Independence Day''), abused children (''Concrete Angel'') and teenage pregnancy (''Beautiful Again'') sound upbeat. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $35 to $90. (Sisario) 'MOUNTAIN STAGE' (Tomorrow) Sooner or later every old-fashioned country radio program comes to New York for a broadcast from the big city. This West Virginia performance show, begun in 1983, is on a short tour of the Northeast, and guests at the Town Hall stop tomorrow include Joan Osborne, Nellie McKay, David Bromberg, the Roches and Toby Lightman. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $35 to $65. (Sisario) NO FUN FEST (Tonight through Sunday) Now something of a spring tradition, this four-day festival of noise-rock -- and any other kind of avant-garde music, as long as it's clamorous and loud -- concludes this weekend. Tonight are Incapacitants, Mouthus with Axolotl, Sissy Spacek and Carlos Giffoni, the festival's organizer. Tomorrow's bill has the most potential, with the veteran Japanese noisemongers Merzbow and Keiji Haino, as well as Demons, Religious Knives, Tom Recchion and Oblivia. Sunday's closing show is headlined by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, and also features Aaron Dilloway (formerly of Wolf Eyes), Burning Star Core with Zaimph, and Leslie Keffer with Rodger Stella. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 6 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Richards Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007, thehookmusic.com or nofunfest.com; $18 (sold out tomorrow). (Sisario) JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Wednesday) Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn and depressed, sung with the guileless vulnerability of a 2 a.m. phone confession, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' She has a Wednesday residency this month at the Living Room. At 11 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) OLLABELLE (Tonight) This local quintet of two women and three men worships blues, country and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, playing traditional songs like ''John the Revelator'' and originals that connect them to classic roots-rock. At 7:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) OXFORD COLLAPSE (Thursday) Drawing from the tense jangle of 1970s and early-'80s American groups like Television and the Feelies -- a refreshing shift from the Gang of Four-Joy Division axis that has defined New York retro-rock for years -- Oxford Collapse beefs up its anxious, speedy songs with cathartic smashes and unison chants. With Centipede E'est and Excellent. At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $8. (Sisario) * JOHN PIZZARELLI AND JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) These married musicians have been called ''the Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim, Dave Frishberg, Paul Simon, and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross join hands. (Through May 26.) At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 Tuesday through Thursday; $85 tonight and tomorrow. (Stephen Holden) PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES (Tomorrow) This Seattle band, with a knack for angular, heartfelt melodies that cut through clouds of noise, is on its farewell tour. With Moonrats and Call Me Lightning. At 9 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $15.50. (Sisario) ANNIE ROSS (Tuesday) When this jazz legend barks out ''I Got Rhythm,'' she turns this great Gershwin standard into a hipster's credo. If you've got as much rhythm in your body and music in your head as Ms. Ross does at 76, who indeed could ask for anything more? At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Flatiron district, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden) SECRET MACHINES (Tomorrow) The slowly unfolding, keyboard-driven compositions of Secret Machines have a stark, minimalist side; a glimmer of country; some pulsating; and a streak of Pink Floyd grandeur that swells to fill the room. There's a haunted undercurrent amid the pomp. The band plays with the Bellmer Dolls and Dragons of Zynth as part of the High Line Festival. At 9 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com or highlinefestival.com; $26.50. (Pareles) * BEANIE SIGEL (Tuesday) Recently this gruff Philadelphia rapper has been in and out of jail, been shot in the arm and found himself caught in the middle of a big-league rap feud. But fans of Beanie Sigel, whose rhymes detail life on the lam and the sad minutiae of prison life (''You hearing grown men moan at night''), will mob this club show not only for the rare chance to see him perform -- you never know when he'll be back -- but also for a preview of his eagerly awaited new album, ''The Solution.'' At 8:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) STEELY DAN (Monday and Tuesday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature,'' and its members, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but has become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as lead guitarist. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Pareles) * GWEN STEFANI, AKON, LADY SOVEREIGN (Tonight and Sunday) She may sing about morning sickness and motherhood on her latest album, ''The Sweet Escape'' (Interscope), but Gwen Stefani has not slowed down; for her latest tour expect a full-fledged pop circus, with sexed-up cheerleader routines and costumes garish enough to rival Madonna's. With Akon, the ubiquitous Senegalese-American crooner, whose amorous songs are explicit without seeming nasty. (Some disagree: Verizon withdrew its sponsorship for this tour because of Akon's onstage behavior at a recent club appearance.) Also on the bill is the spark plug of British rap, Lady Sovereign.

(Sisario) ROD STEWART (Tomorrow) His four Great American Songbook albums may not represent the most distinguished readings of those songs -- ditto the Bob Seger and Creedence Clearwater Revival covers on his recent ''Still the Same Great Rock Classics of Our Time'' (J) -- but when Rod Stewart lets go of his smugness, that whiskey tenor of his can be a powerful interpretive instrument. Doesn't happen often, though. At 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9303, nassaucoliseum.com; $52 to $125.

(Chinen) DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this one, led by his former trombonist Slide Hampton, happily exploits.

(Chinen) * BRUCE HORNSBY, CHRISTIAN MCBRIDE, JACK DEJOHNETTE (Wednesday) An unlikely but not unpromising summit of Mr. Hornsby, whose identity as a singer-songwriter often overshadows his lithe abilities as a pianist; Mr. McBride, a jazz bassist who has also worked prominently in pop; and Mr. DeJohnette, a drummer whose elastic propulsion creates its own stylistic world. They are preparing for the release of an album together, and raising funds for an arts education initiative called JazzReach. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B.

The production, staged by Lynne Hayden-Findlay and conducted by Carmine Aufiero, is double cast: Justin Ryan and Peter Hakjoon Kim alternate in the title role. Giving singers opportunities to perform is the mission of the company.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Roberta Smith) * International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Holland Cotter) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Cotter) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'Apocalypse Then: Medieval Illuminations From the Morgan,' through June 17. The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Neue Galerie: 'Van Gogh and Expressionism,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) The Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Philosophy of Time Travel,' through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world's latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: Matthew Brannon, 'Where Were We,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein's brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Taryn Simon,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown CLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity. The gallery setting eliminates the usual distance; the startling intimacy allows you to experience afresh the momentum and innovations of Monet's astounding trajectory in the span of three small galleries. Basically, it is a chance to encounter, up close and in detail, the evolving ways of seeing and painting that established the originality, historical importance and continuing irresistibility of Monet's art. It should not be missed. Wildenstein & Company, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through June 15. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo * 'Gego, Between Transparency and the Invisible' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * 'Rebel, Rebel: Remembering Karlheinz Weinberger (1921-2006)' The self-taught Swiss photographer Karlheinz Weinberger, who died last year at 81, began his career taking pictures for a gay club in Zurich, but found his true subject in rebellious, working-class teenagers who dressed to shock in the 1960s and '70s. The Weinberger pictures in this show are fairly tame, as if chosen to complement the cooled-out work of the three younger artists -- Ryan McGinley, Walter Pfeiffer and Collier Schorr -- who surround him. But at his best, he's in a class by himself. Anna Kustera, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, kusteratiltongallery.com, through next Friday. (Cotter) Last Chance * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE' Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound, is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Katrin Sigurdardottir: High Plane V' Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir's ''High Plane V,'' a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org.; closes on Monday. (Benjamin Genocchio) * JOHN ZURIER: PAINTINGS It may be a bit late in the game for sincere monochrome paintings, but this San Francisco artist, who made a wan impression at the 2002 Whitney Biennial and is now having his solo debut, often pulls it off. Mainly, he refuses to be programmatic. His colors range from black to bright. The proportions of his canvases are constantly shifting. And his brushwork is an active, varied ingredient, free of bombast. To some extent he reiterates the monochrome the way James McNeill Whistler foretold it, with a bit too much misty preciousness, perhaps, but with genuine feeling. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441, www.peterblumgallery.com/soho.html; closes tomorrow. (Smith)"

Sunni participation is critical to the election and while a boycott is far from certain, American officials fear the election will be regarded as illegitimate if there is one. A1 Two suicide car bombs exploded within 15 minutes of each other in eastern Baghdad, killing at least 10 Iraqis and one American soldier, Iraqi and American officials said. The first bomb exploded next to an American military convoy, military officials said, and the second near a police academy. A10 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld paid an unannounced visit to Iraq, greeting troops, conferring with commanders and mapping out strategy with Iraqi leaders in an effort to ensure that elections can be held. A11 Dissent Eases on Afghan Vote The quest by opposition candidates to have Afghanistan's first presidential election nullified appeared to fade on Sunday, as some candidates moderated their stance in light of a consensus proclaiming the election, while not problem-free, a success because of the high turnout and low level of violence. Officials expect a final result to take two or three weeks. A3 3 Die at Hands of Bomber A suicide bomber blew himself up at a Shiite mosque in Lahore, Pakistan, killing himself and three other people and wounding at least eight, Pakistani officials said. The suicide attack comes just a day after unidentified gunmen killed a leading pro-Taliban Sunni cleric and his aide in Karachi. The killing had raised fears of reprisal attacks among the minority Shiites. A3 First Clue in Egyptian Bombing Investigators disclosed their first lead into the triple suicide bombing on the Sinai Peninsula with the confession from a Bedouin tribesman that he recently sold a large quantity of explosives to a young Egyptian man. The authorities now have a physical description of the man, said an Egyptian officer. A8 Taiwan Leader Calls for Talks President Chen Shui-bian called for opening peace talks with mainland China, in a conciliatory overture following President Hu Jintao's consolidation of power last month in Beijing. He also called for an emphasis on arms control. A5 More U.S. Troops in Colombia The number of American military personnel in Colombia will double, to 800, in the coming months, based on a weekend vote in the United States Congress. The action was welcomed by President Álvaro Uribe's government for its fight against Marxist rebels but condemned by human rights monitors, who warned of a sharp escalation in Colombia's conflict.

But over the last 10 months, the administration's efforts to carry out the first phase of that law, providing drug discount cards to the elderly, have been plagued with difficulties. A1 Prosecutor in the Spotlight Ronnie Earle, who has been the prosecutor in Travis County, Tex., since Jimmy Carter won the White House, is in the spotlight as he pursues a case with ties to one of the most powerful Republicans in the country, Representative Tom DeLay, whose ethical problems in Washington could help Democratic candidates for the House. A14 National Issues in Swing State Local and regional issues usually dominate Wisconsin politics, but a sharp debate over the war in Iraq and domestic security is shaping the Senate race in the state this year. The debate on the two issues is at least as sharp as in the presidential race, where Wisconsin is considered a swing state. A16 Edwards Makes the TV Rounds John Edwards appeared on five Sunday morning talk shows, keeping the Democratic campaign in the public eye as John Kerry limits his campaigning in the next few days to prepare for the third and final presidential debate, in Tempe, Ariz. A17 Up to 62 television stations owned or managed by the Sinclair Broadcasting Group -- many of them in crucial swing states -- will show a documentary highly critical of Senator John Kerry's antiwar activities 30 years ago within the next two weeks, Sinclair officials said.

The host of the gathering, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, right, hopes progress can be made in balancing Britain's proposal to scale back farm subsidies that benefit countries like France with French and German demands for a reduction in Britain's annual budget rebate. DOWN TO THE WIRE -- Europe's protectionist agricultural policy -- not just its $50 billion in subsidies to farmers but also its high tariffs on imports -- is creating quite a trans-Atlantic row. The United States says Europe's refusal to bend is threatening the future of world trade talks, scheduled to resume in Hong Kong in December. Developing countries want both the United States and Europe to open their markets wider, and Washington is proposing steeper reductions in subsidies and tariffs than capitals like Paris are prepared to accept. The European Community is expected to come up with a revised offer later this week. HIGH-TECH TRAVEL -- Starting Wednesday, all passports issued by the 27 countries participating in the United States Visa Waiver Program, which allows business travelers and tourists to enter the country for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, must display a digital photo of the holder.

Durable-goods orders for September will be reported on Thursday. Third-quarter gross domestic product numbers come out Friday. SLOWING DOWN -- Earnings reports will ease a little from last week's pace; many companies will report results but fewer big names are among them. Here are the highlights: Today, American Express, Merck, Texas Instruments; tomorrow, BellSouth, DuPont, International Paper, Northrop Grumman, U.S. Steel; Wednesday, Boeing, ConocoPhillips, Lucent; Thursday, Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, Verizon.

(Showtime) A SINGLE MAN (2009) Colin Firth, in the first of his Oscar-nominated roles (he's currently favored to win for best actor for ''The King's Speech''), plays George, a middle-aged professor in 1962 Los Angeles who, in one emotion-filled day, prepares to commit suicide after the death of his longtime lover, Jim (Matthew Goode). Nicholas Hoult is the flirty student and Jon Kortajarena the charming hustler who cross George's path; Julianne Moore (above with Mr. Firth) is Charley, the close friend who wishes she and George could be more. Reviewing this directorial debut from Tom Ford, the former creative director of Gucci, following the outline of the 1964 novel by Christopher Isherwood, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times: ''That Mr. Ford has placed so much weight on Mr. Firth suggests that he knows how valuable his actor is to his first effort. And while 'A Single Man' has its flaws, many of these fade in view of the performance and the power of Isherwood's story. Part of the radical importance of Isherwood's novel is its insistence on the absolute ordinariness of George's life, including with Jim, whose relationship together is pictured only briefly in both the novel and the film, and yet reverberates deeply (then as now). Mr. Ford's single man might be less common than Isherwood's, a bit too exquisitely dressed. But with Mr. Firth, Mr. Ford has created a gay man troubled by ordinary grief and haunted by joy, a man apart and yet like any other.'' 10:30 A.M.

In preparation, both sides filed court memorandums on Tuesday. Prosecutors recommended that Arenas serve three months in jail, according to The Washington Post. Arenas pleaded guilty on Jan. 15 to storing four unloaded guns in the Wizards' locker room at the Verizon Center, and using them in a joke with his teammate Javaris Crittenton. As part of his plea agreement, prosecutors filed only a single gun possession charge. The Post reported that the Assistant United States Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh was seeking a jail sentence because Arenas provided inconsistencies in his dealings with prosecutors and showed little remorse other than how the incident impacted his career. ''If any other individual without fame, power and the wealth of this defendant, brought four firearms into the District for the purpose of a similar confrontation, the government would seek their incarceration and the court would almost certainly give it,'' Kavanaugh wrote, according to The Post."

5721,2000/10/12,U.S. May Pressure Landlords to Allow Digital Competition,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/12/business/us-may-pressure-landlords-to-allow-digital-competition.html,"The Federal Communications Commission is considering issuing new rules today that would take a step toward forcing commercial landlords to open their buildings to almost any communications carrier that wants access to their tenants, according to people close to the commission. As new forms of digital communication have swept the nation and hundreds of companies have emerged to provide them, landlords of apartment buildings and office towers have had an almost inviolable right to determine which companies may set up shop inside their properties. Now that may begin to change. Government officials and industry executives said commission members and their staffs were still battling over the proposals yesterday afternoon and it was possible the F.C.C. could postpone any action. But whether the issue is addressed today or in the near future, the battle lines have been drawn. Consider 450 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, a building near 44th Street that includes the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell, a law firm, and Cline Davis & Mann, an advertising agency. Hines Interests, the building's manager, holds stakes in Broadband Office and Allied Riser Communications, young companies that wire office buildings and offer advanced communications services. Hines has allowed the two to install equipment at 450 Lexington and has yet to give other carriers the same access. Davis Polk and Cline Davis refused to comment, as did Broadband Office. But communications companies that think they are being shut out, as well as some consumer advocates, have not hesitated to attack a system they say is unfair. ''Given the paucity of local communications competition that has emerged since the telecommunications deregulation act of 1996, it's absolutely critical to use every mechanism possible to jump-start greater consumer access to multiple telecommunications providers,'' Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, said yesterday. ''This would be one step forward for breaking down barriers to local competition.'' Others see the matter differently. ''To us, a building is a community,'' said Steve Peterson, a vice president at Hines, a commercial real estate company based in Houston. ''In Texas alone there are 419 registered CLEC's,'' he added, using industry jargon for competitive local exchange carriers. ''Can we have 419 carriers and their equipment in our building? The answer is no.'' ''We're not trying to exclude anybody,'' he said. ''But we want to make sure that all of the carriers are there for the long haul, and yes, we want to maintain a little bit of control over the process. It's our building, after all.'' The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the commission to foster increased competition in local markets, and the F.C.C. chairman, William E. Kennard, a Democrat, has made that a primary goal. But realizing that any attempt to exert direct jurisdiction over landlords would be fraught with political and perhaps legal difficulties, the commission appeared to be leaning toward trying to deal with the controversy indirectly. Rather than regulate landlords, the F.C.C. was considering issuing rules that would prohibit carriers from agreeing to exclusive real estate deals, according to industry executives and people close to the commission. Under the proposal, the carriers, who almost always are subject to regulatory certification, would not be allowed to sign a contract under which they would be the only company allowed to install a network in an office building. In addition, the commission appeared to be leaning toward requiring communications carriers to share their space within office buildings with competitors. To serve business customers who spend thousands of dollars a month on communications services, some companies prefer to install advanced antennas on roofs. Others like to put some sort of switch or router in the basement. Many want to install wiring throughout the building. The landlords control a company's ability to deploy its system. If this fight sounds familiar, it should. In many ways, the debate is just the latest variation of AT&T's battle to retain control over Internet services delivered over its cable system, or, for that matter, the fight over whether America Online must open its instant messaging system to rivals. With some exceptions, landlords have almost the same power in apartment buildings as in office towers. But the issue has become ripe in the business sector because some carriers prefer to install equipment in the buildings of businesses they serve. Such equipment is generally not required to serve residential consumers. The conflict over access to commercial buildings is bubbling over just now because the real estate industry is more involved than ever in the communications business. Landlords are taking financial stakes in new carriers in exchange for giving those carriers the sometimes exclusive right to install equipment. Phone giants like Verizon Communications and SBC Communications, which already have lines into almost all the roughly 750,000 office buildings across the nation, have not been on the front lines of this debate. Those with complaints are generally smaller, newer companies. ''We're seeing an increasing amount of landlords who are interested in choice only to the extent that they have taken a financial interest in a carrier,'' said David S. Turetsky, a senior vice president at Teligent Inc., a new local communications company, and a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department. ''What they all have in common is that none of those models respects the ultimate choice of the tenant.'' Broadband Office was formed by a consortium of real estate companies, together with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm. Joey D. Mooring, a spokesman for Allied Riser, said his company had granted warrants, a form of equity ownership similar to stock options, to some real estate companies that have opened their buildings, but would not be specific. ''Tenants within the buildings should have the ability to choose who their provider is,'' he said. As a business proposition, lobbyists for the real estate industry tend to agree. But as a matter of regulation, they say the government has no right to tell landlords who can and cannot come in. ''This is something that's driven by the tenant market, and tenant choice is the way for people in the real estate industry to be successful,'' said Roger Platt, spokesman for the Real Access Alliance. This group, formed by many of the nation's biggest real estate companies, has lobbied the F.C.C. to back off. ''Building owners are being portrayed as evil characters out of a Dickens novel,'' he said. ''One of the fundamental aspects of being a manager of property is you have the right to both include certain people and to exclude certain individuals. There are narrow constitutional restrictions on that, but otherwise the Constitution is very clear.'' That argument has found some resonance at the F.C.C. At least one commissioner, Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican, has made it clear from the start that the case for forced access is weak at best, said Helgi Walker, a legal adviser to Mr. Furchtgott-Roth. ''Even if such statutory authority were within the discretion of the commission,'' she said, ''the exercise of that discretionary authority would at least raise questions about the constitutionality of its action.'' Taking a page from AT&T's playbook, the Real Access Alliance has suggested voluntary guidelines for preserving competition. In addition to other rules, the commission may make a point of trying to hold the alliance's members to those commitments. Some communications experts suggested that having taken intermediate efforts would be a necessary building block in any future effort to regulate property owners more directly. In the end, however, the companies that have complained appear more interested in getting fast access to buildings than in helping the F.C.C. expand its jurisdiction. ''The point is really to create a process that shortens something that already works,'' said William J. Rouhana Jr., chairman of Winstar Communications, a new local carrier. ''We get access to a lot of buildings, but it takes us an average of nine months to do it. Almost every landlord starts out wondering if they shouldn't consider doing an exclusive, and once that's off the table then the whole process is shortened.''"

At lesser-quality telecom and media services companies, like Global Crossing, Nextel Communications and PSI Net, high-yield corporate debt and convertible bond issuance ballooned to $275 billion, a compounded annual rate of 60 percent, in the period."

In New Jersey, Blossom A. Peretz, the ratepayer advocate, called on the Board of Public Utilities to reduce Verizon's charges for such access to less than $10 per line a month, from the $16.21 the board set in 1997. That fee was voided last year by a federal judge saying that they have been set in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Bruce Cohen, general counsel for Verizon New Jersey, said yesterday that Ms. Peretz was asking his company to ''subsidize our competitors'' by providing them access ''at a rate below our cost.'' In New York, the attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, urged the Public Service Commission to adopt access-fee cuts recommended by an administrative law judge.

It said the charge was needed because it had to pay fees to local phone companies, predominantly Verizon, for access to networks to complete in-state long-distance calls. A Verizon spokeswoman, Ivette Mendez, said yesterday that there was no justification for the fee increase because the access fees Verizon charges have gone down. The disagreement is the latest in a dispute between AT&T and Verizon over fees AT&T pays to use Verizon's system. AT&T customers whose long-distance bills are less than $1 will not have to pay the new fee, nor will customers in its program for low-income customers. Joseph P. Fried (NYT)"

Cellular antennas and data lines had already been out; now, all of a sudden, land lines went, too, and everyone from court officials to F.B.I. agents were scrambling to get phone service. More than three weeks later, it is clear that some solutions emerged quickly, and also that the easy part is over, with the hard part just beginning. The damaged Verizon building, a switching center in a 32-story Art Deco building on West Street, has equipment in five sub-basements that were flooded by a water-main break and firefighting efforts even before 7 World Trade Center collapsed into the side of the building, ripping gaping holes into walls lined with millions of dollars in equipment."

As one 1990's survey of Internet politics concluded, virtual communities ''resemble the semiprivate spaces of modern health clubs more than the public spaces of agoras'': ''instead of meeting to discuss and debate issues of common concern to the society, members of these virtual communities meet largely to promote their own interests and to reinforce their own like-mindedness.'' As a result, the cultural critic David Shenk wrote in his book ''Data Smog,'' ''It appears that rather than our world becoming a cozy village, we are instead retreating into an electronic Tower of Babel, a global skyscraper. Instead of gathering us into the town square, the new information technology clusters us into social cubicles. There are fewer central spaces, and not even a common channel.''"

''I usually never even remember my dreams,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''This one I remembered. Two weeks later, the dream was reality.'' And so it happened that on Monday night, for the fourth week in a row, a queue of workers from the World Trade Center site filed into Mr. Cohen's 75-seat TriBeCa Playhouse at 111 Reade Street. It is the playhouse closest to the disaster scene, and they were there to be entertained at the Stage Door Canteen. The basic idea is to bring Broadway and Off Broadway talent to ground zero.

Seizing on the national mood, President Bush has called for the creation of a civil defense service that would supplement security efforts by the police, fire departments and public health agencies. That call to civic duty mirrors a bipartisan Senate proposal that would quintuple the size of AmeriCorps, the domestic Peace Corps initiated by President Bill Clinton.

It is a ritual of appraisal of performance and achievement of goals that is approached with dread -- sometimes by the reviewer, too. Now come these reviews of the review process. Alan Heisey, who now publishes a consumer magazine and a newspaper for the construction industry in Toronto, recalls a manager whose oral evaluation of his work many years ago was more than generous. The evaluation came while Mr. Heisey was a material control supervisor for a television manufacturing factory. He recalls the manager saying, ''If you aren't the best man who ever worked for me, you are one of the best, and I am glad I've got you.'' Mr. Heisey writes, ''That kind of praise has never occurred before or since, but it is memorable, I think, particularly because he fired me a month later.'' ''Annual appraisals for staffers in hundreds of diverse field offices across the country were a huge problem for my company,'' writes George Zucker of Haverford, Pa., remembering his days as a journalist. ''They were still working on it when I retired. ''Our personnel mavens didn't want appraisals heavy on praise and light on red flags. 'We don't become a great company by telling each other how great we are,' was an oft-quoted adage.'' He added: ''The problem was finding credible ways to grade outstanding staffers. Good people expect good reviews and can be overly sensitive to negative feedback. They might quit to find more appreciation elsewhere. ''One year the field managers were ordered to rank each of our staffers numerically. It was a disaster, and the personnel chief was livid when the managers were called to New York the next year for a post-mortem.'' As Mr. Zucker recalls it, the personnel chief ticked off some of the failures of the new system and then looked directly at Mr. Zucker as he said: ''One manager had half his staff ranked in the top 10. How can you do that?'' Mr. Zucker said he replied, ''I had a bunch tied for No. 1.'' There were no rankings after that. ''I am a human resources professional, so you would think that we would treat our own as we preach,'' says Sharon Scheirer, the human resources director at the Equinox Resort in Manchester, Vt. ''One of the positions I held was as a regional manager for a Fortune 500 company. My boss, the vice president for human relations, was located in the Midwest. One day, after my first anniversary, a confidential envelope arrived with my name on it. Surprise! It was my performance review, thanking me for my excellent work during the year. No discussion, no notice that the review was on the way -- just a one-sided appraisal with some dollars attached. ''I now use this example of how not to do it when coaching managers during performance appraisal training.'' ''I have been on both sides of the performance review process, the giver and the receiver,'' writes Joseph Stagnitta of Hyde Park, N.Y., a retired product manager in the world trade division of I.B.M. ''And yes, the task can be dreaded by both parties.'' One time, he said, he was surprised to receive a performance review based on a one-week-old plan ''delinquently submitted by my then current manager.'' ''I challenged the appraisal,'' he added, ''and it was escalated to higher management, which upheld my position that the appraisal was not fair. ''Then, in another instance I had an opportunity to provide the surprise when I declined signing an agreement about my performance review when, in response to my inquiry about what I need to do to improve my rating even further, I was told, 'Walk on water.' ''From that point on, I never rated my company a '1' in the annual opinion surveys, at least not till they showed me how they could walk on water.'' ''As a career changer, I was used to political performance reviews to keep me under the glass ceiling for my age,'' writes Karen S. Kendler, a computer consultant and freelance writer from Riverdale, the Bronx. ''However, one of the worst I ever had was one where my manager forced me to give low priority to technical growth as a career growth objective and then gave me performance feedback indicating I needed to concentrate more on technical growth. ''Damned if you do and damned if you don't.'' Kevin C. Naff of Baltimore, now a manager of business development at Verizon Wireless, knows what to do when he wants a good laugh. He pulls out a review he received seven years ago. While working as an assistant editor for a business trade magazine, he writes, he reported to an editor who was ''one of those types who feels obligated to nit-pick only so she can remind you who's in charge.'' ''She presented my review, which told glowing tales of my superior, flawless performance,'' he recalled. ''Then I turned the page. There, under the section titled 'Needs Improvement,' she wrote: 'Kevin needs to inprove his poofereading skills.' '' Mr. Naff is still laughing."

In recent years, healthy competition has revolutionized the market for many telecommunications products, from long distance to cellphone services.

5181,2002/05/12,Dig It,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/12/magazine/dig-it.html,"For about 300 years, Murray Street was a street. Then, last winter, after the World Trade Center went down, it was dug up and turned into a hole. Not a little hole. Not a hole with a few flags and two or three workers and a blinking yellow light. The hole that was Murray Street was a crumbling and steaming and wooden-plank-reinforced earthen gash, which, if it weren't lying sideways across the border of TriBeCa and the financial district, would have been about 100 stories tall. In January, on a cold, clear morning, just after the underground version of Murray Street had been opened up, Mike Redes, a project manager for Empire City Subway, a Verizon-owned company that maintains utilities under the street, was standing on a single-family-home-size plot of subterranean real estate in which Murray Street meets Church Street. Over the previous several weeks, the area had been excavated nearly in its entirety, revealing an open stream of cables and conduits, pipes and mains that separated the former World Trade Center from the rest of Manhattan like a moat. As Redes stood there, as he waved his arm and pointed into the man-cut crevasse, men with short shovels were scrambling into the hole, tossing up steaming dirt. ''What the heck am I gonna do?'' he says. ''I've got to put a manhole in!'' (A manhole is a vault that allows technicians to gain access to underground cables without tearing up the street. The entrance is covered by, yes, a manhole cover.)"

Seidenberg, the chief executive of Verizon Communications, mused at an investment conference that his company might bid for WorldCom ''for the fun of it'' if the stock price of that long-distance and Internet carrier continued falling. Since then, WorldCom's shares have dropped 80 percent, to $1.58 on Friday. But as Mr. Seidenberg wryly suggested, conditions in the communications sector are so tough that Verizon has no real interest in WorldCom at any price. Verizon, along with rivals like SBC Communications, BellSouth and Deutsche Telekom, all have plenty of their own problems without taking on WorldCom's, which include gigantic debt and an accounting investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission."

The pricing regulations are meant to let rivals viably compete with the entrenched local phone companies by leasing access to their networks rather than having to build expensive duplicate systems. Although local telephone competition has been slow to catch on for a variety of reasons, rivals have blamed the intransigence of the dominant local companies."

With its unusual shape, somewhat like a cello, its airy ambience, beautiful wood paneling and velour seat covers, Verizon Hall immediately felt like an inviting space to hear a concert. But you were reluctant to place your hand on a railing for fear of getting smudged with wet varnish. The air-conditioning system was stuck on high, and the hall was freezing. Given this, many critics and concertgoers were hesitant about making a pronouncement on the question that mattered most: How are the acoustics?"

Most likely, you would guess your local telephone company, but the thick, heavy book could easily have come from one of the increasingly prominent independent publishers. In a humorous effort to explain the difference to consumers, Yellow Book USA, the largest of the independents, introduced this month its most expensive campaign since the company was founded in 1930 as a Long Island community directory. The campaign, with the theme ''Yellow Book.

The loss, corporate Europe's biggest, succeeded in overshadowing the $12 billion loss in 2001 reported last month by Vivendi Universal, the French media giant, as European companies scramble to reassess the value of assets acquired at the height of the boom in technology, Internet and telecommunications stocks."

Lucent Technologies, the large maker of communications equipment, said last week that its sales would decline much more than expected, about 15 percent this quarter, as its main corporate customers reduce spending.

But a cellphone isn't a perfect solution: for one thing, unless people know to call you on it, they may miss you by calling a land-line number instead. Even eliminating the land line at home won't necessarily help; callers may still miss you by dialing only your office phone. But there are other ways to ensure that you are never out of touch no matter what phones you use. A variety of services are available that make it easy for callers to find you. These services can be particularly useful for families in which one member travels a lot, the children are away at school or elderly relatives need to stay in touch."

A supremely confident swinger, he would rather play the genially reverent custodian of the American popular songbook, concentrating on the pleasure to be found in his material. He is so comfortable on the stage that he makes relaxation and rhythmic command appear synonymous. Yet because he relishes abrupt dynamic shifts and stylistic juxtapositions, his singing is full of surprises. A song that begins as a half-whisper can build to a fierce final shout, and jazz riffing can transform into flowery semioperatic flourishes. When Mr. Bennett chooses to zero in on the raw emotion of a ballad, however, the payoff is usually electrifying. During the Duke Ellington segment of his Carnegie Hall concert on Wednesday evening in the Verizon Music Festival, Mr. Bennett introduced ''Mood Indigo'' as his favorite Ellington song and bit into it with a keening vengeance. Pitching it near the top of his upper register, he turned it into a sustained cry of anguish that culminated in a rending melismatic descent on the final word: ''die.''"

Still, during his solo piano set on Thursday night at the Jazz Standard -- part of a five-day series within the Verizon Music Festival, which is presenting a fine array of solo jazz pianists -- he played short pieces, paused to introduce new songs, welcomed the audience a few times and played host. This is what young jazz musicians do these days: it is an effect of having heard all your life the two contradictory, mindless pseudo-truisms that jazz is America's great music of the people and that it can be understood only by a narrow, smug elite. In fact, jazz is a viable art, and much remains to be said in it.

Under federal bankruptcy law, which is aimed at giving troubled companies a chance to reorganize and return to financial health, the government may not revoke a license ''solely because'' the holder has sought protection from its creditors. The federal appeals court here ruled last year that the F.C.C. violated this law by seizing the licenses for which NextWave had promised to pay more than $4 billion. Catching the telecommunications roller coaster at a high point, the commission then reauctioned the licenses to Verizon Wireless and other major companies for $16 billion. But the licenses have never been released because of the legal battle. A victory for NextWave would allow the company to use the licenses to finish building its wireless network or sell them to another company."

''Tell me about it,'' Mr. Floyd says in an empty conference room where the walls are covered with maps with neighborhoods limned by squiggly lines. ''This is not for easy public consumption.''"

Verizon is appealing the case, which will determine whether copyright holders can use a shortcut subpoena process to gain access to personal information about Internet subscribers they suspect of illegally copying material online. The company said yesterday that it was asking Judge John Bates to block his order in Federal District Court in Washington until the United States Court of Appeals could review the case. The company argues that the recording industry's view of its rights under copyright law is incorrect and unconstitutional because it would violate the privacy of its subscribers. The recording industry association said it would oppose Verizon's effort to block the order. Amy Harmon (NYT)"

So when the bonus period ended recently because her contract had expired, her monthly bill nearly tripled. She knew she had to quickly find another plan to keep pace with her use, but which one? Mobile phone carriers are competing aggressively these days for customers.

Still, a visit is less about the Olympics as they were than about life as it was. Lake Placid has the rhythm of a small town, albeit one with the sophistication to have played host to the world, and its pace is spiked by active people who embrace the mountain and lake setting that has attracted visitors for centuries.

That represents 4.5 million more households, the companies said. BellSouth and rivals like Verizon Communications Inc. want to compensate for declines in their calling business by adding customers for Internet access, which they say is as much as 50 times faster than dial-up phone links. The carriers are competing with cable television companies, which also sell fast Web connections. Last week, Verizon said it would make 10 million of its phone lines capable of delivering fast Internet access, after the Federal Communications Commission deregulated installation of equipment."

We've come a long way since Mr. Cooper's first call, though not quite as far as we need to go before wireless phones fulfill their ultimate promise. High on the list of shortcomings is the fact that customers can't keep their number if they change service providers. If Verizon Wireless or Cingular had been around 30 years ago to sell Mr. Cooper a service plan, he would have had to stick with the company all these years, unless he'd been willing to surrender his number.

Clarke in the science-fiction novel ''2061: Odyssey Three'' predicted a future as follows: ''With the historic abolition of long-distance charges on 31 December 2000, every telephone call became a local one, and the human race greeted the new millennium by transforming itself into one huge, gossiping family.'' That future may be at hand, only a few years behind schedule, as a result of the telephone industry's declining economic fortunes, increasing competition and recent technological advances. Starting with MCI, which introduced its Neighborhood plan in April 2002, most leading phone companies -- AT&T, BellSouth, Qwest Communications, SBC Communications and Verizon -- have rolled out programs that allow customers in some states to make unlimited local and national calls for one flat monthly price."

As the chairman of the Internet job board known as Monster, Taylor has built a central hub for the world's job seekers and located it just down the hall from his large corner office. Actually, the hub is somewhat less grand than it sounds: a brightly lighted room, dense with the fug of electronic heat, lined with rows of Dell computer servers. These are the company's databanks. Monster currently has about 26.5 million résumés on file and lists about a million help-wanted ads from employers every month. ''Each of these servers can do 480 job searches a second,'' Taylor said as we paused in front of some blinking equipment on a recent afternoon. ''We get two million visitors per day and 30,000 new résumés. People come here quietly and stomp around looking for work. They're here right now.'' Taylor can quickly relate what the traffic through this room says about the state of health-care jobs (strong and growing), general desperation (we're still in a trough) and manufacturing (those 2.5 million lost jobs may not be coming back). He considers Monster an early indicator of trends in the broader market. So it is not encouraging to hear that at this moment, in midspring, a rebound is not visible -- postings by employers remain flat to down."

Cellphones can transmit both voice and photos, but millions of people prefer to fire off short, painstakingly typed text messages. What's next, a comeback tour for smoke signals? The popularity of Nextel, whose cellphones double as national walkie-talkies linking its customers, proves the point. Remember walkie-talkies? To speak, you have to hold down a button on the side of the phone. Only one of you can talk at a time. You can say ''Over!'' after each utterance (although these days, a little beep conveys the same point)."

A Verizon spokesman, Mark Marchand, would not say how much the contract was worth. Nortel expects to report a profit for 2003 after net losses of more than $35 billion in the preceding five years. Nortel is winning orders as carriers upgrade networks with packet-switching technology, which compresses voice and data traffic so it can be sent together over high-speed lines. Shares of Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, rose 92 cents, to $5.68. The shares are down from a high of $89 in July 2000. Verizon shares rose 8 cents, to $36.56."

Many excesses of the 1990's have been wrung out, and the chances that chief executives will reap hundreds of millions of dollars from cashing in stock options have diminished."

Lindsay, declaring that he was at ''perhaps the most important event of my administration,'' picked up a telephone at police headquarters and made a ceremonial call to a three-digit number, 911. The call did not go through, so the mayor dialed again. Then again. Finally, someone realized he was using an inside phone line, and pushed a button. With that, the mayor managed to complete the call, and officially launch the city's 911 line. Last year, New Yorkers dialed 911 an average of 23 times every minute, using a simple phone number now chiseled into public vocabulary, habit and expectation. Yet the 911 operation that grew since Mr. Lindsay made those first calls is less a seamless network of police, fire and ambulance services than a brittle contraption -- fragmented, uncoordinated, and in parts, dangerously obsolete and vulnerable, according to city and emergency response officials."

The coolness between the orchestras dates to June 1984, when Herbert von Karajan, the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, canceled its concert in Salzburg, Austria, and invited the Vienna Philharmonic instead, because he and his players were at odds over his decision to appoint a woman, Sabine Meyer, as clarinet soloist."

4867,2004/05/26,Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: NextWave Settlement Approved,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/business/technology-briefing-telecommunications-nextwave-settlement-approved.html,"NextWave Telecom has won approval of a settlement with federal regulators that resolves a dispute over a $4.3 billion debt for airwave licenses purchased at government auctions. NextWave agreed last month to return most of its spectrum licenses to the Federal Communications Commission and either give back other airwave rights or pay $386 million out of proceeds from their sale. The accord, approved by Judge Adlai S. Hardin Jr. of Federal Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, gives mobile carriers like Verizon Wireless another opportunity to buy the licenses. ''I have been before you a lot of times in the past six years and there have been a lot of twists and turns in this case,'' a NextWave lawyer, Deborah Schrier-Rape, told Judge Hardin. ''We are here to end the problem that has governed NextWave for the past six years.'' The legal battle between NextWave and the commission culminated in a United States Supreme Court decision last year that allowed NextWave to keep the spectrum that the government reclaimed in 2000. NextWave owed the commission $4.3 billion out of $4.8 billion for the licenses won in auctions in 1996 and 1997 and the debt remained an obstacle to its successful reorganization. The company expects to submit a reorganization plan by July, said Michael Wack, a NextWave lawyer and spokesman."

As part of its deal with Verizon Communications, which owns the other 55 percent of Verizon Wireless, Vodafone can demand up to $20 billion for its stake in the venture, to be paid in two equal payments.

Created in 1987 when its predecessor, Fleet Call, started buying spectrum licenses used by radio dispatchers, the company teetered financially for years. It has few ties to telephone giants like Verizon and AT&T. And its offbeat ''Push To Talk'' service, which lets cellphones double as walkie-talkies, was considered too cute to be a threat in the turbulent mobile phone market."

Eager to survey this amazing growth industry, I sat down and, for the first time in my life, studied for the SAT. Night after night, surrounded by dozens of helpers, print and electronic, I worked my way though sentence completions, vocabulary tests, word problems and algebraic equations that I had not a prayer of being able to solve.

Beginning with its billing cycle next week, Verizon Wireless will eliminate a 40-cent monthly fee to cover the costs associated with a rule, enacted a year ago, allowing customers to keep their phone numbers when switching service providers. Responding in part to Sprint, which cut a similar fee to 25 cents from 40 cents, Verizon, the nation's second-largest mobile phone carrier, will forgo $15 million a month. Dimes add up when you have more than 40 million customers. GOING NUCLEAR -- The future, it appears, is going to be a tough place to get to. A consortium of countries, including members of the European Union, along with South Korea, Japan, China, the United States and Russia, has been working on a futuristic fusion reactor that will be three decades and about $10 billion in the making. But creating a clean and everlasting source of energy may be simple compared to figuring out where to build the reactor.

Given union readiness to strike in the face of even modest efforts to slim generous health plans, these costs almost certainly doom unionized workers to few if any real wage increases for years to come. Do union leaders get this trade-off? Are they hamstrung by political dynamics that make it hard to approve even sensible health plan changes that can be cast as ''givebacks''?

In considering offers during a two-month bidding war, the board decided that the current dollar value of the deals was just one consideration. The directors also tried to determine what the deals would be worth a year from now, when regulators are likely to sign off.

4856,2005/08/21,Politicized Scholars Put Evolution on the Defensive,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/national/21evolve.html,"When President Bush plunged into the debate over the teaching of evolution this month, saying, ''both sides ought to be properly taught,'' he seemed to be reading from the playbook of the Discovery Institute, the conservative think tank here that is at the helm of this newly volatile frontier in the nation's culture wars. After toiling in obscurity for nearly a decade, the institute's Center for Science and Culture has emerged in recent months as the ideological and strategic backbone behind the eruption of skirmishes over science in school districts and state capitals across the country. Pushing a ''teach the controversy'' approach to evolution, the institute has in many ways transformed the debate into an issue of academic freedom rather than a confrontation between biology and religion."
4469,2005/08/23,"A Book to Read Carefully, With a Physical Therapist Near",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/23/books/23big.html,"''Hunger's Brides,'' Paul Anderson's debut novel, is certain to be one of the biggest books of the fall. The question is how many readers will want to do the heavy lifting required to read it. At 1,360 pages (not counting 8 pages of titles and contents at the beginning of the book and 8 blank pages at the end, presumably added for production reasons) the book, quite simply, is massive. It weighs 4 pounds, 9 ounces, equivalent to two and a half copies of ''The Da Vinci Code,'' and it is thicker than Verizon's Manhattan telephone directory (either the white or yellow pages)."
4237,2005/08/23,Store Owner Hurt In Midtown Shooting,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/23/nyregion/23shot.html,"The owner of a frozen dessert store on Madison Avenue near 37th Street was shot last night as he was closing the store shortly before 10, the police said. The owner, a 52-year-old man, whose name was not released by the police, was shot twice in the chest inside the store, Candy Club, at 238 Madison Ave., and staggered outside to a folding chair in front of it, witnesses said. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was listed in very critical condition, the police said."
3577,2005/08/24,Verizon to Sell High-Speed Net Connections for $14.95 a Month,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/technology/24internet.html,"Verizon Communications said yesterday that it would start selling high-speed Internet connections for $14.95 a month to attract customers with slower dial-up connections and to compete with cable companies. The company also formed a marketing alliance with Yahoo, which has created a Web portal for Verizon customers. This largely displaces a similar deal Verizon had with Microsoft for MSN to be its Web portal."
4106,2005/08/25,Wireless Firms Seek Big Deal: Cellular System For the Subway,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/25/nyregion/25phones.html,"The decision to introduce cellphone service in the city's underground subway stations touched off a flurry of interest in the telecommunications industry yesterday, as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority began soliciting bids for a 10-year contract that will involve immense technical complexity and probably be worth $50 million to $100 million. Representatives of the country's four largest wireless companies -- Cingular Wireless, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile -- all said yesterday that they were considering submitting proposals to build the wireless voice and data network, which will cover 277 of the city's 468 stations. Companies that make wireless hardware -- cables, radios and antennas -- also expressed interest. Bids are due on Oct. 12."
4244,2005/08/27,A Monthly Mystery,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/27/business/27phone.html,"For many Americans, figuring out the monthly phone bill has become the consumer's equivalent of deciphering hieroglyphics, with baffling new fees creating a thicket of items at the bottom of the bill. Some providers like MCI have even started adding a ''paper bill'' fee to pay for the bill itself. Some of the add-ons are new, like the ''property tax allotment,'' ''carrier cost recovery fee'' and ''single bill fee.'' Others, like the ''subscriber line charge,'' are growing as a portion of an average monthly bill."
4311,2005/08/28,Siren Songs,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/opinion/nyregionopinions/WE_Siren.html,"If the Indian Point nuclear plant is going to stay where it is -- on the Hudson River, in a region populated by millions of people and served by an overburdened network of congested roads and highways -- and keep doing what it does, and if a disaster at the plant, however unlikely, requires evacuating vast numbers of those people as quickly as possible, it only makes sense to have a warning system that will work when you need it to. In other words, all the time."
4537,2005/08/28,"More Convenience in Subway, Or Just More Screech?; Views Differ on City's Plan to Allow Cellphone Service in 277 Stations",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/nyregion/28phone.html,"Lily Li, a real estate broker, takes the bus instead of the subway so that she can use her cellphone to keep track of her 7-year-old son. Alonzo Munden, a retail worker, stands in line at a pay phone on the subway platform so he can tell his wife when he will arrive home. Yoram Silagy, a lawyer, sees the subway as a sanctuary from the irritating din of idle cellphone chatter. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's decision to invite companies to install an underground wireless phone and data network, linking the airwaves of 277 stations to the world of the streets above, could profoundly alter the time-tested rhythms of the New York City subway system. Passengers like Ms. Li, Mr. Munden and Mr. Silagy, all Manhattan residents, could find their routines enhanced or disrupted -- or both."
4235,2005/08/30,An IPod Cellphone Said to Be Imminent,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/30/technology/30apple.html,"Apple Computer and Motorola plan to unveil a long-awaited mobile phone and music player next week that will incorporate Apple's iTunes software, a telecommunications industry analyst who has been briefed on the announcement said on Monday. The development marks a melding of two of the digital era's most popular devices, the cellphone and the iPod, which has become largely synonymous with the concept of downloading songs from the Internet or transferring them from compact discs."
4103,2005/08/31,MCI Called Close to a Deal on Back Taxes,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/31/business/31mci.html,"MCI Inc. is close to an agreement to pay a total of $315 million in back taxes to 15 states and the District of Columbia, according to a person briefed on the negotiations. A settlement, which could be reached as early as the middle of next week, would close one of the many legal actions stemming from the 2002 bankruptcy of WorldCom, MCI's predecessor."

In this insecure age, improvements like these make sense, assuming they work as advertised. The $212 million package includes many more cameras to watch and record the millions of passengers who hurry through the system every day. The surveillance technology is also expected to include new motion sensors and a new kind of electronic eye that is supposed to be capable of spotting a bag a few seconds after someone has left it under a seat."

Mr. Ebbers was sentenced to 25 years in prison in July after jurors in New York convicted him of conspiracy and securities fraud and seven counts of making false filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission that drove WorldCom into bankruptcy. Judge Barbara S. Jones of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who previously ordered Mr. Ebbers to surrender to prison on Oct. 12, granted his request to remain free until his appeal is decided.

Being a landlord means dealing with multiple challenges: choosing the right tenants, planning for a panoply of legal, financial and maintenance obligations, navigating the bureaucratic maze and understanding that for the small landlord there are no economies of scale -- no discount on the low-volume fuel bill; top dollar to the tradesman called in because there is no plumber on staff; in fact, probably, no staff.

At the same time, as part of Verizon's consolidation efforts, he helped the company buy the old AT&T headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., for $100 million. Next, Equity Office hired him and his team to act as leasing agent for the former Verizon headquarters, with 1.1 million square feet of space.

September 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' The New York City Opera is already in session, having last week presented new productions of Strauss's ''Capriccio'' and Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Patience,'' and a revival of Mark Lamos's acclaimed production of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' repeated today. These and another revival, of Rossini's ''Viaggio a Reims'' on Sept. 22, will carry the company through to its next new production, of Dukas's ''Ariane et Barbe-Bleu'' on Oct. 6. Continues today. New York State Theater. CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER The cellist David Finckel and the pianist Wu Han, a husband-and-wife team announced last year as music directors of the society, finally make their presence felt in performance, with the pianist Emanuel Ax, the percussionist Don Liuzzi and others. Thursday. Alice Tully Hall. LOUISIANA PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA The only thing that seems clear is that the orchestra will not open its season on this, its scheduled date. Here's hoping that it can get up and running before the season is out. Thursday. Orpheum Theater, New Orleans, (504)523-6530. www.lpomusic.org BACH CHORAL WORKSHOP Once again, Carnegie Hall jumps the gun on its official opening in the main auditorium with a professional training workshop, this one led by the Dutch Bach specialist Ton Koopman. A week's activities involving 24 singers and a chamber orchestra culminate in a concert of cantatas. Sept. 19. Zankel Hall. METROPOLITAN OPERA The big drama at the Met this season promises to take place behind the scenes. The plot has Joseph Volpe, the imperious and irascible general manager, grooming his successor, the ambitious and often testy Peter Gelb, recently of Sony Classical records -- and this at a time when finances and audiences are slumping. If the two get through it alive, Mr. Gelb will undoubtedly be as thrilled as Mr. Volpe when the season ends with a Volpe farewell gala, on May 20. Here, meanwhile, is the season-opening gala, with Isabel Bayrakdarian, Susan Graham and Bryn Terfel in Act I of Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' Angela Gheorghiu and Mr. Terfel in Act II of Puccini's ''Tosca'' and Denyce Graves and Plácido Domingo in Act III of Saint-Saëns's ''Samson et Dalila.'' James Levine, not yet in complete thrall to the Boston Symphony, conducts. Sept. 19. Metropolitan Opera House. NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Whatever surprises or challenges the orchestra's season may hold (like a timid ''focus'' on Elliott Carter, consisting of four works) are not apparent in the first week, which presents two programs conducted by Lorin Maazel, both built on the same model. On opening night, Evgeny Kissin plays Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto, and Mr. Maazel conducts Strauss's ''Don Juan'' and a ''Rosenkavalier'' Suite. In the subscription concerts that follow, Lang Lang plays Chopin's First Piano Concerto, and Mr. Maazel conducts Mahler's First Symphony. Sept. 21-24, 27. Avery Fisher Hall. ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA It has been a long courtship -- long enough that the orchestra got into a scrape with management last year, in a bitter lockout (or strike or whatever), and that its new music director, David Robertson, has been bruited for positions in Chicago and elsewhere even before officially taking over this orchestra. It finally happens, in a bracing program including Claude Vivier's ''Lonely Child'' and John Adams's ''Harmonielehre.'' Sept. 23-25.

LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA From his new perch at Carnegie Hall, the orchestra's former manager Clive Gillinson watches as his onetime charges make their annual visit to Lincoln Center. The orchestra has in recent years provided, perhaps too readily, a forum for its venerable music director, Colin Davis, to indulge old specialties anew, but the results are often compelling. The golden oldies here are Verdi's Requiem, Sibelius's ''Pohjola's Daughter'' and ''Kullervo,'' and Vaughan Williams's Sixth Symphony and Walton's First. Look not so much for blazing revelations as for the comforts of accumulated wisdom and the mellowness of age and familiarity. Sept 28, 30; Oct. 2. Avery Fisher Hall. NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Neeme Jarvi begins his tenure as the orchestra's music director with a surprise er, ''Surprise'': Haydn's Symphony No. 94. But any hint of real adventure -- and there are a few this season -- will have to await future programs, as Saint-Saëns's Piano Concerto No.2 (with the excellent Marc-André Hamelin as soloist) and Rachmaninoff's ''Symphonic Dances'' fill out the program.

PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Yuri Temirkanov and the orchestra generally come to New York bearing big Russian masterworks, and the first concert, opening the Carnegie Hall season, runs true to form with Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto (played by Yefim Bronfman) and Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony. But the other two programs are surprisingly cosmopolitan, with works by Weber, Brahms, Dvorak and Sibelius. No matter, there is plenty of scope for Mr. Temirkanov to display his inimitable command of the long line. Sept. 29-Oct. 1. Carnegie Hall. NEW YORK COLLEGIUM The ensemble opens its eighth season sonorously and antiphonally, with music of Giovanni Gabrieli from Venice at the turn of the 17th century. The program, conducted by Andrew Parrott, includes motets, canzonas, sonatas and a 17-voice Magnificat. Sept. 30.

The record labels have already begun to celebrate -- if you can call a recording named ''Lamentate'' (the Hilliard Ensemble, from ECM New Series) a celebration. Harmonia Mundi France has released a tribute album, with performances led by Paul Hillier. And now comes a DVD, ''24 Preludes for a Fugue,'' a documentary about Mr. Pärt and his music. It should be fascinating to see how far the filmmakers could burrow into his hermetic existence. September. Naxos/Idéale Audience.

A related article is on Page 89. 'ORION' In assembling this big work, commissioned for the Athens Olympics in 2004, Philip Glass seems to have been as much impresario as composer, bringing together longtime collaborators from around the world.

''We Are the World'' with a punch, perhaps, and a powerful one, according to some who have experienced it. Oct. 4, 6-8.

Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)721-6500. www.lincolncenter.org 'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEU' Leon Botstein is more widely valued as a champion of obscure repertory than as a conductor per se. And in fact, he presented this little-known opera by Paul Dukas in concert with the American Symphony Orchestra in 1999. So it is fitting that he makes his conducting debut at the New York City Opera with it. Carol Vaness was to have made a triumphant return to the company in the demanding title role but canceled because of an injury. Renate Behle replaces her. Opens Oct. 6. New York State Theater. VIRGIL FOX LEGACY With a variety of organists on hand, performances and discussions honor the memory of the ultimate switched-on master of the instrument on the 25th anniversary of his death. Don't expect the obsequies to be subdued. Oct. 7-10. Various churches in Manhattan, (212)799-9300; (800)486-6628. www.LegacyConcerts.com 'TROUBLE IN TAHITI' Caramoor, the home of a popular summer music festival, is expanding its activities during the concert season. Here Michael Barrett conducts members of Caramoor's Bel Canto Soloist program in Bernstein's witty little opera. (Bernstein later wrote a less witty companion piece, ''A Quiet Place,'' whose absence is no great loss.) Oct. 8. Caramoor, Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1492. www.caramoor.org BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA You can almost see the fun that James Levine is having, planning entire orchestral seasons. At the Metropolitan Opera, it is, say, ''Don Giovanni'' or ''Fidelio,'' ''Don Carlo'' or ''Tristan und Isolde,'' ''Wozzeck'' or ''Moses und Aron.'' Those are wonderful choices, but they are limiting, night after night, year after year. This well-stuffed program is a prime example of a fertile imagination at play: Elliott Carter's ''Three Illusions,'' in its New York premiere; Lukas Foss's masterwork ''Time Cycle,'' with Dawn Upshaw as vocalist; Ives's ''Three Places in New England''; and Gershwin's Piano Concerto in F, with Jean-Yves Thibaudet as soloist. Oct. 10. Carnegie Hall. JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA The Juilliard School celebrates its centenary with special events throughout the season, but this is the official anniversary concert. Dennis Russell Davies conducts Webern's Six Pieces (Op. 6) and Schubert's Ninth Symphony as well as a work commissioned for the occasion, Einojuhani Rautavaara's ''Manhattan Trilogy.'' Oct. 11. Carnegie Hall. MARIN ALSOP Ms. Alsop was already drawing wide attention before her recent fracas with the players of the Baltimore Symphony over her appointment as music director in 2007. And surprisingly, given that her reputation has been as a champion of unfamiliar repertory, that attention was for a recording of Brahms's First Symphony with the London Philharmonic Orchestra on Naxos, the first in a complete CD cycle of the Brahms symphonies. Here she conducts that First at the New York Philharmonic, along with works by Prokofiev and James MacMillan. Oct. 14-15, 18. Avery Fisher Hall. BEAUX-ARTS TRIO The group has just turned 50, at least in the person of its founding pianist, Menahem Pressler. It is in its scond of three seasons surveying all the piano trios, violin sonatas and cello sonatas of Beethoven. Oct. 14; Dec. 2; April 21. Metropolitan Museum. APRILE MILLO This soprano, who went from quick stardom at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere to lower-profile engagements and cult status, is evidently making a new bid for stardom. She was acclaimed as Tosca at the Met last season, and now she makes her recital debut at Carnegie Hall, with the pianist Ken Noda. The repertory will range from Puccini, Verdi and Donizetti to Brahms and Mahler. Oct. 14. Carnegie Hall. In addition, Ms. Millo will sing the title role in Leoncavallo's ''Zazà'' in a concert performance by Teatro Grattacielo. Nov. 12. Alice Tully Hall. CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA An adversarial press is hardly new to the conductor Franz Welser-Möst, after his rude baptism at the London Philharmonic a decade and more ago. Now he finds himself embattled in Cleveland with Donald Rosenberg, the chief critic of The Plain Dealer. The root complaint seems to be that Mr. Welser-Möst is no Christoph von Dohnanyi, his predecessor. Granted. Mr. Welser-Möst is his own man. And some of us -- having heard at least as many brilliant moments as lesser ones from him, especially in Brahms -- would like to know that man better. Here, at any rate, is more Brahms, the First Symphony and the ''Academic Festival Overture,'' as well as the New York premiere of Chen Yi's ''Four Seasons.'' Oct. 17. Carnegie Hall. CECILIA BARTOLI The program this adventuresome musical sleuth sings here -- as yet unidentified music by Alessandro Scarlatti, Caldara and Handel -- presumably duplicates in large part her new Decca recording, ''Opera Proibita.'' In the first decade of the 18th century, when opera and other theatrical works were banned in Rome by the pope, composers wrote underground, for private performances, or resorted to subterfuge, writing operatic works masquerading as oratorios and the like. For obvious reasons, much of this music has been slow to come to light, and Ms. Bartoli's album is said to include premiere recordings. If anyone can turn these pieces into instant classics, it is Ms. Bartoli. Oct. 19. Carnegie Hall. NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG The festival opens its 18th season with ''Since the 70's: A Generation of Song,'' featuring works by the likes of William Bolcom, John Musto, John Corigliano and Ricky Ian Gordon. Oct. 19. Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330. www.nyfos.org CHRISTOPHER MALTMAN He ''may have the world's most perfect baritone voice at the moment,'' The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote after Mr. Maltman performed in Brahms's ''German Requiem'' with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Although you try to maintain a certain critical skepticism, claims like that catch your attention, especially when they are seconded by reports from trusted acquaintances. Here is a chance to judge for yourself, as Mr. Maltman performs a wildly varied song recital, with Malcolm Martineau as pianist. Oct. 20. Zankel Hall. BARD MUSIC FESTIVAL After two hectic festival weekends in August, there is, evidently, still something to say about Copland and his world. Just ask Leon Botstein. (No, you won't even have to ask.) Oct. 21-23. Fisher Center, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900. www.bard.edu/bmf 'PIANO FORTE' The Met Museum has been presenting ever more impressive series of piano recitals in recent years, paying particular attention to young competition winners. This new season-long series presents some of those but also includes established veterans. The organization is based on juxtapositions of repertory. Sergey Schepkin leads off here with a program of Bach and Brahms. Fazil Say and Frederic Chiu chime in later with more Bach and Brahms. Antti Siirala, Stephen Kovacevich, John O'Conor and Martin Kasik play Beethoven and Schubert. Marc Laforêt and Alexei Grynyuk play Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Begins Oct. 22. Metropolitan Museum. ROYAL STOCKHOLM PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA It is undoubtedly a fine orchestra, but much of the attention here will be focused on its music director, Alan Gilbert, a youngish American of whom big things are expected. The first program is unusual: an extended set of Scandinavian vocal works, sung by Anne Sofie von Otter, followed by Mahler's Fifth Symphony. The second, apart from the New York premiere of Anders Hillborg's ''Exquisite Corpse,'' is more standard: Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, played by Lars Vogt, and Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony. Oct. 22-23. Carnegie Hall. 'THE MINES OF SULPHUR' There are works that you know exist, for one reason or another, yet never get a chance to hear (unless the conductor Leon Botstein lives in your neighborhood). And then there are works that seem to come out of nowhere, like this 40-year-old opera by Richard Rodney Bennett. The production comes from the Glimmerglass Opera, where it was the surprise hit of last summer, and Glimmerglass forces have already recorded the work for Chandos. David Schweizer directs, and George Manahan conducts. Opens Oct 23. New York State Theater. ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S A new Telarc recording of Mozart's Requiem, conducted by Donald Runnicles, has been acclaimed as much for Robert Levin's inspired completion of that unfinished work as for the typically splendid work of the Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus. Here Mr. Runnicles imports that choir to steal a march on the Mozart year, with the stirring Requiem and the ineffable ''Ave Verum Corpus.'' Oct. 27. Carnegie Hall. SHOSTAKOVICH CENTENNIAL In any major Shostakovich celebration, you can trust that the symphonies and the string quartets will be tended to, as they are this season by Great Performers at Lincoln Center. But there are still vast tracts of repertory lying fallow. Here the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center cultivates one of those tracts, the chamber repertory, but studiously leaves the string quartets to others. Good forethought. Oct. 28, 30; Nov. 1. Alice Tully Hall. BACH CHOIR OF NEW YORK The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, having found a new conductorless playmate, performs for the first time with chorus. The estimable Kent Tritle, the innovative and tireless music director at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue, is the choir's artistic and music director. It joins Orpheus in Bach's Magnificat as part of the band's Carnegie Hall concert on Dec. 3. But the groups also combine in two full programs of Bach cantatas in the Met's Medieval Sculpture Hall. Oct. 31; March 13. Metropolitan Museum. 'MESSIAH' If you're going to have yet another recording of Handel's perennial, it may as well be one to provoke thought or visceral reaction. And the more standard the work, the more you can count on Nikolaus Harnoncourt to tee you off at some point. It should be revealing to see how Mr. Harnoncourt's views on the work may have changed since he recorded it 20 years ago, given his various adventures inside and outside the early-music world since. A strong vocal cast (Christine Schäfer, Anna Larson, Michael Schade and Gerald Finley) joins the Arnold Schoenberg Choir and the Concentus Musicus Wien. October. Deutsche Harmonia Mundi. November CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In his last season as the orchestra's music director, Daniel Barenboim comes calling to New York with three programs centering on big symphonies: Bruckner's Fifth, Schubert's Ninth and Mahler's Fifth. The rest is Schoenberg, Elliott Carter and the inevitable (this season) Mozart. Nov. 3-5. Carnegie Hall. GIDON KREMER Mr. Kremer is a violinist of consummate refinement and technique. If you have any doubt, watch for his new recording of Bach's unaccompanied sonatas and partitas, to be released by ECM New Series next month. (Having heard Mr. Kremer perform the works in concert three years ago, I will recommend the recording, sound unheard.) But Mr. Kremer's service to music has gone far beyond his brilliant fiddling, particularly in spreading the good word about a number of East European composers. Alfred Schnittke was one of his early causes and continues to be a favorite. Here Mr. Kremer presents the New York Philharmonic premiere of Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No. 5. Mikko Franck conducts, and Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony fills out the program. Nov. 3-5. Avery Fisher Hall. ANGELA HEWITT Ms. Hewitt is an admirable Bach pianist, deft, graceful and outgoing, though she is not always entirely riveting. Here she plays the first book of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier,'' and it will be fascinating to see how well she conveys the interiority, intensity and concentration of these pieces. Nov. 5. Miller Theater. McDUFFIE DUTTON KIRSHBAUM TRIO The literature for string trio is not so rich that there are many permanent ensembles. But this ad hoc group of solo-caliber players -- the violinist Robert McDuffie; the violist Lawrence Dutton, of the Emerson String Quartet; and the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum -- should do just fine in works by Mozart, Beethoven and Dohnanyi. Nov. 5. 92nd Street Y. 'CHANT WARS' We tend to think that what has come down to us as Gregorian chant is a simple, monolithic and changeless body of music. Nothing of the kind. The men's contingents of two respected early-music groups, Sequentia and Dialogos, square off to dramatize the formative ninth-century conflict between the cantors of Charlemagne and those of the pope. It is a program the groups have been honing for several years, and a recording of it is to be released by Deutsche Harmonia Mundi in October. I'm not sure who plays whom, but my money is on Sequentia (maybe only because I haven't heard Dialogos). Nov. 6. Metropolitan Museum. 'THE LITTLE PRINCE' At the New York City Opera, Rachel Portman's opera about well, you know. The production is by Francesca Zambello, with sets and costumes by Maria Bjornson. Opens Nov 12. New York State Theater. ENGLISH CONCERT This once pioneering period-instrument group has been re-energized by the firebrand violinist Andrew Manze, as it shows once again in its new recording of Heinrich Biber's Missa Christi Resurgentis on Harmonia Mundi France. Biber seems to be a particular passion of Mr. Manze, who in this concert sandwiches Biber works between his own reconstructions of ''original'' versions of two of Bach's orchestral suites. Nov. 14. Zankel Hall. 'ROMÉO ET JULIETTE' Two years ago, as she was emerging from a vexing period of vocal troubles, Natalie Dessay spoke tentatively about expanding her repertory to include this Gounod opera, pending her successful return to the Met as Zerbinetta in Strauss's ''Ariadne aux Naxos.'' The deal must already have been in the works for this new production, and fortunately, Ms. Dessay's intervening fortunes have done nothing to scotch it. Ramón Vargas is a practiced Roméo, and Guy Joosten directs. Opens Nov. 14. Metropolitan Opera House. PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA So, in the wake of the Marin Alsop flap at the Baltimore Symphony, how much does it matter if an orchestra and its music director do not madly love each other? Philadelphia appears to be a test case at the moment. Several players were vocal in their opposition to the hiring of Christoph Eschenbach four years ago, and many a discouraging word is still heard. In any case, the Eschenbach-Philadelphia chemistry has not set the world on fire -- or even the American Northeast, preoccupied as it is with James Levine and the Boston Symphony. Mahler's gloomy and portentous Sixth Symphony, which Mr. Eschenbach conducts here, in the orchestra's first New York appearance this season, may strike close to home. Nov. 15. Carnegie Hall. BRADLEY BROOKSHIRE Approaching the seventh annual concert of his eight-part survey of Bach's complete works for his instrument, Mr. Brookshire remains perhaps the most skilled and inventive Bach harpsichordist in New York. (No backhanded compliment intended, but that's another story.) Here Mr. Brookshire plays the ''French Overture,'' the ''Italian Concerto'' and the three- and six-part ricercares from ''A Musical Offering,'' along with a wild card: the premiere of Charles Wuorinen's ''Harpsichord Divisions.'' Nov. 16. St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212)378-0248. www.stbarts.org 'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' Britten's, that is, presented by the Juilliard Opera Center, directed by Eve Shapiro and conducted by David Atherton. (For that matter, Shakespeare's, too, presented by the Juilliard Drama Division during the same period -- a rare opportunity.) Nov. 16, 18, 20. Juilliard Theater. 'SHELTER' The Bang on a Can composers -- Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe -- return to BAM with another large-scale multimedia work, performed by the unlikely combination of the hard-charging musikFabrik and the ethereal Trio Mediaeval. The theme of the work, as described in BAM's brochure, takes on added resonance soon after a horrendous hurricane: '''Shelter' mines the myriad connotations of the work's title -- physical structures, intimate personal exchanges, a metaphoric home for our beliefs -- ultimately questioning whether what we build can protect us against the destructive power of the world around us.'' Nov. 16-19. BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100. www.bam.org DAVID ROBERTSON ''Seeing Debussy, Hearing Monet'': this is not what people have in mind when they talk about orchestras turning into museums. (By the way, how did ''museum'' come to be a pejorative? There are daring museums and stodgy ones, contemporary museums and classical ones. We might do better if some of our orchestras were more like certain museums. But that's for another day.) This concert, exploring the parallels between Debussy and Monet, is the first of four with the St. Louis Symphony in Mr. Robertson's Perspectives series at Carnegie. In two others, in the spring, they will perform Michael Jarrell's melodrama ''Cassandre'' and John Adams's Sept. 11 piece, ''On the Transmigration of Souls.'' Nov. 18. Carnegie Hall. ANNE-SOPHIE MUTTER It's a little hard to get around the cheesecake in the press kit (well, not all that painful), but the idea of Ms. Mutter's Mozart Project seems to be that she is recording (again, at least in large part) all of Mozart's major works for violin. The chamber works are still to come. Here, on two CD's, are the five concertos and the glorious Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola, with Yuri Bashmet. Ms. Mutter conducts the London Philharmonic Orchestra from the fiddle. November. Deutsche Grammophon. 'LA TRAVIATA' If you missed Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón in Verdi's opera at the Salzburg Festival this summer, you may want this recording. If you heard them, you may want it even more. November. Decca. December 'AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY' Having gotten back into the commissioning of operas a quarter-century ago, the Metropolitan Opera has carried on fitfully. John Harbison's ''Great Gatsby'' was the last to appear, in 1999. Tobias Picker's ''American Tragedy,'' based on the Dreiser novel, will be directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted (whatever the reason for James Levine's reticence) by James Conlon. To its credit, the Met is throwing a lot of vocal star power at the work: Patricia Racette, Susan Graham, Jennifer Larmore, William Burden, Nathan Gunn and others. Opens Dec. 2. Metropolitan Opera House. TRIO MEDIAEVAL It seemed almost too convenient, a couple of years ago, when this gifted female vocal trio appeared on the scene just as Anonymous IV was about to leave it. But subsequent concerts and recordings have only solidified the credentials of the trio, which is based in Oslo. A new recording, ''Stella Maris,'' is due out this month on ECM New Series. The trio's Christmas program here, laced with Norwegian traditional songs, is sure to be a delight. Dec. 10. Weill Recital Hall. ST. THOMAS CHOIR For years, when Gerre Hancock directed this choir, it presented the ''Messiah'' of choice in the New York holiday season. I have yet to hear how that ''Messiah'' may have changed under St. Thomas's new director of music, John Scott, but I have no reason to suspect anything less here. (I did hear Mr. Scott conduct the choir in Bach's ''St. John Passion'' in March, and you won't want to miss his reprise of that masterwork on April 4.) Dec. 13, 15.

A related article is on Page 88. BALTIMORE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The management's decision to hire Marin Alsop as the orchestra's next music director met with sharp resistance from the players when it was announced in July. Although the rancor was aimed mainly at management, for what was called a hasty hiring process, Ms. Alsop, who is to take over in 2007, also came in for direct criticism. Pleasantries were quickly re-established, but the first real test of the altered relationship comes here, as Ms. Alsop visits with music by Mozart, Dvorak and Christopher Rouse. Jan. 12-13. Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, (410)783-8000. www.baltimoresymphony.org JONATHAN NOTT This British conductor made a considerable impression in the spring, when he visited New York with both the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra and the Ensemble Intercontemporain. And that impression was only enhanced by the release of several of his Bamberg recordings by Tudor. He has set himself a difficult task in his New York Philharmonic program, with Strauss's ''Alpine Symphony,'' a big, lumbering work that doesn't get a lot of respect. (I, for one, would take it any day over, say, the ''Sinfonia Domestica.'') To fill out the program, the violinist Joshua Bell will play John Corigliano's ''Red Violin'' Concerto. Jan. 12, 14. Avery Fisher Hall. 'THE MANY FACES OF MOZART' Last season, before he was installed as music director of the New Jersey Symphony, Neeme Jarvi took over its annual winter festival and steered it toward one of his passions, Nordic music. Now that he is in place, he stands aside and lets others (Gilbert Varga, Bernard Labadie and Vladimir Feltsman) tend to the winter festivities kicking off Mozart's 250th-birthday year. (How come? Does Mr. Jarvi see where all this Mozart mania is heading?) Jan. 12-29.

'THE ESSENCE OF LIGETI' The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center picks up where the Miller Theater left off in its season-opening celebration of Gyorgy Ligeti. In the middle program, the coruscating pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard plays several of the thorny études. Jan. 13, 15, 17. Alice Tully Hall. THOMAS HAMPSON The American baritone makes a stop in ''Song of America,'' a 12-city tour presented in part by the Library of Congress, which provides a touring exhibition of rare musical manuscripts. Wolfram Rieger is the pianist. EMI Classics is to supply a companion CD in November, just before the start of the tour, in Kansas City, Mo. Jan. 19. Carnegie Hall. MISSA SOLEMNIS Beethoven's sacred masterpiece is always an event, but the vocal soloists (to say nothing of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus) should lift this one to a lofty plane. They are Deborah Voigt, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson (if she is healthy and singing again in what is supposed to be a busy season for her), Ben Heppner and René Pape. Some team! Jan. 19-21. Symphony Hall, Boston, (617)266-1492. www.bso.org ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE If you feel compelled to program Mozart (as everyone does this season), you could hardly do better than John Eliot Gardiner and his forces. Here they offer a program of the last three symphonies (Nos. 39, 40, 41), soon to become a cliché, as it happens. And with the Monteverdi Choir, they perform the Mass in C minor alongside the Requiem. Jan. 22. Avery Fisher Hall. Jan. 23. Alice Tully Hall. 'THE PASSION OF OSVALDO GOLIJOV' Great Performers at Lincoln Center throws its considerable resources into a major, monthlong celebration of the Argentine-American composer, including two of his recent big works, the opera ''Ainadamar'' and the ''Pasión Según San Marcos.'' Jan. 22-Feb. 22. Various Lincoln Center theaters. BERLIN PHILHARMONIC Talk about dodging a bullet. Just a few years ago Carnegie Hall was contemplating a boneheaded merger with the New York Philharmonic -- in effect, closing in on New York. Now Carnegie is opening to the world, developing special relationships with far-flung orchestras. Its first is with the Berlin Philharmonic, which will present an eight-day residency involving community activities as well as concerts in 2007. In the meantime, Simon Rattle and the orchestra are visiting with four concerts, more than any other foreign orchestra this season. The repertory is rich and varied, ranging from Haydn and Mozart to Strauss and Mahler, from Schoenberg's Variations (Op. 31) and Ravel's ''Ma Mère l'Oye'' to the New York premieres of Thomas Adès's ''Asyla'' and Hanspeter Kyburz's ''Noesis.'' Both Carnegie and the Berlin Philharmonic seem, after a bit of foot-dragging, to be embracing the 21st century while other institutions slouch toward oblivion. Jan. 25-28. Carnegie Hall. 'THE MAGIC OF MOZART' It promises to be a hectic year for Mozart pilgrims. With the New Jersey Symphony winding down its multiweek festival and with John Eliot Gardiner and his forces having hit and run at Lincoln Center earlier in the week, the New York Philharmonic presents yet another wave of Mozart, with Lorin Maazel conducting the ''Coronation'' Mass, the ''Vesperae Solennes de Confessore'' and five mostly familiar symphonies, and Jeffrey Kahane playing and conducting two familiar piano concertos. Alas, it's that old Mozart magic that we know so well. Jan. 26-Feb. 14. Avery Fisher Hall. FOCUS! 2006 The Juilliard School's contemporary-music festival, in its 22nd season, is up to the minute. Subtitled ''New and Now,'' it features in each program a work commissioned by the school as part of its centennial celebration. The press material even lists a work by Paul Schoenfeld composed in 2006. Let's hear it for procrastination. Jan. 27, 30-31; Feb. 1-3. Juilliard Theater. HILLIARD ENSEMBLE This superb male vocal quartet spoiled us last season by appearing in a mixed conformation with the captivating soprano Joanne Lunn. But we should not hold it against the men for returning to their roots in music of Guillaume Dufay, Josquin Desprez and Nicolas Gombert. This is a typically compelling presentation of the treasurable series Music Before 1800. Jan. 29. Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212)666-9266. www.mb1800.org February STEVEN ISSERLIS It hardly seems possible that this brilliant and well established English cellist has yet to make his New York recital debut, but so says the Y. He does so in his usual thoughtful fashion, with music by a series of composers each of whom mentored the next: Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, Dvorak, Suk and Martinu. Feb. 7. 92nd Street Y. STAATSKAPELLE BERLIN Already, the orchestra's two Mozart programs begin to feel like piling on. Daniel Barenboim conducts the last three symphonies (Nos. 39-41) over two programs rather than one, as John Eliot Gardiner will already have done and as Lorin Maazel will be doing at the same time a few blocks uptown. Even before you hear it, it all begins to sound the same. Feb. 11-12. Carnegie Hall. ROYAL CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA Obviously Carnegie Hall is less vigilant about the duplication of major works in a season than it used to be. Or maybe it just doesn't shove the big guys around. Here, a mere three weeks after Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic let Richard Strauss blow his own horn in ''Ein Heldenleben,'' Mariss Jansons and his Amsterdam orchestra, in their second program, re-examine the life of our self-proclaimed hero. (Fortunately, this musical autobiography was written long before Strauss's involvement with the Nazis.) But in the first program comes an even more grandiose statement, this one less about Shostakovich himself than about his world in cataclysm: his mighty ''Leningrad'' Symphony, which Mr. Jansons should project to a noisy fare-thee-well. Feb. 14-15. Carnegie Hall. JAMES LEVINE Here are a couple of weeks that should tell much about the status of Mr. Levine's honeymoon with Boston Symphony audiences. The first week's program consists of three works by Schoenberg: the Five Pieces and the Variations for orchestra, and ''Pelleas und Melisande.'' The second week's sole offering is Schoenberg's ''Gurrelieder,'' a work steeped in Romanticism (but to know that, you have to be able to get past dread of the composer's name). In fact, Schoenberg even carries into a third week, with his Chamber Symphony No. 1, but all will be forgiven when Beethoven's Ninth Symphony follows. If Mr. Levine can pull off this kind of programming, he really has something going in Boston. Feb. 16-18, 21; Feb 23-25. Symphony Hall, (617)266-1492. www.bso.org KIROV OPERA Valery Gergiev and his hard-working company from St. Petersburg pay their annual visit to Washington, this time with Puccini's ''Turandot,'' Wagner's ''Parsifal'' and Verdi's Requiem. The quality of the performances may depend on just how hard the company has been working lately. The Kirov is now in its fourth year of a 10-year residency at the Kennedy Center, which, press materials say, was ''made possible by Alberto Vilar.'' So he paid in advance? Feb. 19-26. Kennedy Center, (202)467-4600; (800)444-1324. www.kennedy-center.org CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA Well, you have to admit, it isn't as obvious as, say, Kremerata Baltica. Even when I saw that the pianist Andras Schiff was playing and conducting, it didn't occur to me: Andrea Barca is Mr. Schiff's name in Italian. (Don't you hate having to admit your ignorance to a publicist?) The cappella is Mr. Schiff's hand-picked chamber orchestra, made up of notables including the entire Panocha Quartet. Here is still more Mozart, though it's likely to surpass most of what has come before. Over three concerts, Mr. Schiff will play six piano concertos and lead three other choice works, including the Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola. Feb. 21, 23, 25. Carnegie Hall. March VIENNA PHILHARMONIC Among the more laughable aspects of the fracas between Riccardo Muti and the Teatro Alla Scala in Milan last season (and there were many) were dire reports in the European press that Mr. Muti, tyrant that he obviously was, had burned his bridges and might never find gainful employ again. Conductors of Mr. Muti's stature are in short supply, and he is now, as he was before, in constant demand in the highest international circles. And a good thing for New York, which not only got to hear him in April in evident harmony with the New York Philharmonic but gets to hear him again here in one of his prime collaborations, with the proud (not to say haughty) Vienna Philharmonic, which is nobody's punching bag. The three concerts include the expected Germanic fare (Mozart, Schubert, Richard Strauss and Hindemith) as well as works by Bartok and Falla. It's the next best thing to having been at La Scala last May, when Mr. Muti returned with the Vienna Philharmonic in tow. March 3-5. Carnegie Hall. AUDRA McDONALD The Houston Grand Opera has commissioned a new opera for the Broadway star, to be presented as part of a one-woman double bill with Poulenc's ''Voix Humaine.'' In the new work, said to be a lighter foil to Poulenc's gloomy opus, Ms. McDonald will be surrounded by frequent collaborators: the composer Michael John LaChiusa, the director Lonny Price and the conductor Ted Sperling. Opens March 4. Wortham Theater Center, (713)228-6737; (800)626-7372. www.houstongrandopera.org RUSSIAN NATIONAL ORCHESTRA It's a bit perverse of Great Performers at Lincoln Center to attach the title ''Winter Dreams'' to the orchestra's Tchaikovsky minifestival, which does not include the wonderful ''Winter Dreams'' Symphony (No.1), too seldom heard. Instead, the first program offers the bombast of ''Manfred'' and the predictability of the First Piano Concerto (with Yefim Bronfman as soloist). The other programs, more constructively, explore Shakespeare through the lens of Tchaikovsky and Tchaikovsky through the lens of Stravinsky. The fast-rising young Russian maestro Vladimir Jurowski makes his New York orchestral debut. March 5, 6, 8. Avery Fisher Hall. 'MAZEPPA' No one has contributed more to the Russification of Western music over the last decade or two than Valery Gergiev, through visits by the Kirov Opera and Orchestra of the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg and through his own activities with Western ensembles. Mr. Gergiev's proselytizing continues apace at the Met, with a presentation of Tchaikovsky's Pushkin-based ''Mazeppa,'' produced in collaboration with the Maryinsky Theater. Yuri Alexandrov is the director. Opens March 6. Metropolitan Opera House. IAN BOSTRIDGE The peerless English tenor begins his Carnegie Hall Perspectives series with a program of Britten (''Winter Words'' and ''Canticles''), sharing the stage with the countertenor Bejun Mehta, the baritone Nathan Gunn, the pianist Julius Drake and others. A Bostridge recording of Britten orchestral song cycles with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic should already be out in November. Mr. Bostridge's later Perspectives concerts involve the Belcea Quartet, the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes and the soprano Dorothea Röschmann. March 8. Zankel Hall. 'TREEMONISHA' It is surprising that so little attention has been paid to this rousing opera during recent decades despite the sustained popularity of its creator, Scott Joplin. The Collegiate Chorale performs it here in a semistaged version -- a nice gesture, since Robert Shaw, the chorale's founder, presented the first modern performance of the work in 1971 (with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus). March 9. Alice Tully Hall. ATLANTA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Having heard the crack Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus in Mozart's Requiem with the Orchestra of St. Luke's in October, you can now hear the full Atlanta Symphony Chorus in Verdi's Requiem. Robert Spano, fresh from his first encounter with Wagner's ''Ring'' in Seattle last month, tackles this most operatic of liturgical works. March 11. Carnegie Hall. KIROV ORCHESTRA Shostakovich hardly needs a festival to make his way these days, any more than Mozart does. But it happens to be his centenary year, and attention is being paid -- perhaps nowhere more stylishly than at Lincoln Center. The Great Performers series is presenting all 15 string quartets, played by the Emerson String Quartet, and (over two seasons) all 15 symphonies, conducted by Valery Gergiev and divided between the two orchestras he directs, the Kirov and the Rotterdam Philharmonic. Mr. Gergiev kicks things off with the Symphonies Nos. 1, 2, 7, 9 and 10. March 12-13. Avery Fisher Hall. ALEXANDER LONQUICH This pianist, in his New York debut, may be someone to keep a close eye on. Reliable word out of Europe suggests that he is superb. The repertory, though extending from C.P.E. Bach to Wolfgang Rihm, is mostly basic: Mozart, Schumann and Chopin. March 15. 92nd Street Y. JORDI SAVALL Suffice it to say that Mr. Savall's performances at the Met Museum in April -- alone on his viola da gamba, with family members and with his ensembles -- were perhaps the early-music highlight of the last season. Mr. Savall will be active around the city, at Weill Recital Hall on March 2 and at the Miller Theater on March 4. Here he takes part in a gamba master class, a conversation and a concert by Hespèrion XXI. March 15-16. Metropolitan Museum. THOMAS QUASTHOFF The Carnegie calendar so far says only that the bass-baritone Mr. Quasthoff is singing works of Mahler and Schubert. That's good enough for me. Justus Zeyen is the pianist. March 18. Carnegie Hall. 'WALL TO WALL STRAVINSKY' The annual free 12-hour composer marathons at Symphony Space are among the more popular events in any New York concert season. But the immersion treatment should prove particularly apt and revealing with Stravinsky, who worked in so many radically different forms and styles over his career. The producers promise a little of everything, and it should be enough to make any compleatist's head spin. March 18. Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212)864-5400. www.symphonyspace.org LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Kurt Masur is loyal to his friends, and his appearance here, as music director of the orchestra, begins the way his tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic ended in 2002, with the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter playing Beethoven's Violin Concerto. The other music in these two programs is also vintage Masur, including Dvorak's Eighth Symphony and Mahler's First. March 20, 26. Avery Fisher Hall. 'LYSISTRATA' ''Or the Nude Goddess,'' goes the subtitle of this opera by Mark Adamo, presented at the New York City Opera. The New York Times report from the premiere in Houston in March pointed out that only a statue was nude. But it also implied that the work, with ''almost too many ideas for its own good,'' had room for improvement. Might some of those ideas have gone by the boards? Opens March 21. New York State Theater. VERDI'S REQUIEM It is distressing that the New York Philharmonic seems to be spending so much of the season lagging behind the curve. This performance, conducted by Lorin Maazel, follows not only Robert Spano's with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus at Carnegie Hall (by less than three weeks) but also Colin Davis's with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in September, in the same hall. Great Performances at Lincoln Center also anticipates the Philharmonic with a Mozart festival in Avery Fisher Hall -- John Eliot Gardner conducts Mozart's Symphonies Nos. 39-41 less than three weeks before Mr. Maazel does the same -- and with Tchaikovsky's Suite No. 3 and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 10. Well, at least the Philharmonic beats Lincoln Center to the punch with Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5. Don't these people talk to one another? March 29, 30; April 1, 4. Avery Fisher Hall. 'DON PASQUALE' James Levine, during his three decades at the Metropolitan Opera, has generally conducted new productions. But Donizetti's music here is so squarely focused on the voice and so heedless of the orchestra that it comes as a bit of a surprise to see the heavily burdened Mr. Levine busy himself with it. Certainly, those lustrous vocal parts should be well conveyed by Anna Netrebko and Juan Diego Flórez. Otto Schenk, as director, will have to stray far from his Germanic predilections to achieve the requisite light touch. Opens March 31. Metropolitan Opera House. April YOUNG CONCERT ARTISTS This organization's track record is good enough that when it presents its annual program of concertos, you can be pretty sure you'll hear at least one extraordinary performance -- and maybe three. My money here is on the double-bassist DaXun Zhang, who did a sensational stint with the Silk Road Project last year. But there is probably no reason to expect less of Lise de la Salle, a pianist, or Jose Franch-Ballester, a clarinetist. Keith Lockhart conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. April 5. Rose Theater. YO-YO MA Our reigning cellist has spoiled us by presenting all six Bach cello suites in a single evening. Still, only a miserable ingrate (who, me?) could feel shortchanged by a concert of three of these great works, the Suites Nos. 3, 5 and 6, in what promise to be brilliant and knowing performances. And think of the possibilities for encores. April 5. Carnegie Hall. NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Leonard Slatkin conducts a typical mix of new and old, American and European -- typical, at least, since a former regime at Carnegie discouraged some of his more adventurous programming. Works by Barber, Corigliano and Melinda Wagner sit alongside music by Beethoven, Rachmaninoff and Elgar. Emanuel Ax is the pianist in Beethoven's Third Concerto and Ms. Wagner's ''Extremity of Sky.'' April 6-7. Carnegie Hall. ROTTERDAM PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Valery Gergiev picks up his two-season survey of the Shostakovich symphonies with Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 15. April 9-10. Avery Fisher Hall. 'SOLOMON' Americans are likelier to know the early-music conductor René Jacobs from recordings than from live performances. And if you don't know his recordings, you should definitely remedy that in October, when his version of Handel's oratorio ''Saul'' comes out from Harmonia Mundi France; to judge from an advance copy, it is vivid and exciting in its search behind the letter for the spirit of the score. Whatever familiarity you do have with Mr. Jacobs's recent work is likely to make you run, not walk, to hear his performance of ''Solomon,'' another great Handel oratorio, with the English Voices and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. The countertenor Lawrence Zazzo, splendid as David in ''Saul,'' sings Solomon. Lisa Milne is his queen and Marie Arnet the Queen of Sheba. April 16. Alice Tully Hall. MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH If it's a Shostakovich year, can the composer's great friend be far behind? Mr. Rostropovich conducts the New York Philharmonic in Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1, with Maxim Vengerov as soloist, and the Symphony No. 10. Though Mr. Rostropovich is looking frail (by his standards) these days, expect vigor and passion. April 19-22. Avery Fisher Hall. SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Michael Tilson Thomas, who is recording all the Mahler symphonies with the orchestra, keeps it in fighting trim with the Adagio from the Symphony No. 10 in the first program, the Rückert Lieder (sung by Celena Schafer) in the second. April 19-20. Carnegie Hall. 'POCKET CONCERTOS' The Miller Theater, in its relentless pursuit of the new, institutes a three-year project of commissions for concertos with small chamber orchestra. The composers here are Julia Wolfe, John Musto, Ichizo Okashiro and Benedict Mason. And the solo instruments are as eccentric as tuba, double bass and accordion. April 22. Miller Theater. EMERSON STRING QUARTET As its part of Lincoln Center's Shostakovich centenary tribute, this esteemed group plays all 15 of the string quartets, as it did in 2000. Again, it will hew closely to chronological order, with only a couple of transpositions within programs to make for more effective sequences. (The deeply introspective and claustrophobic Eighth Quartet, in particular, almost has to come last to work its full power.) April 27, 30; May 4, 11, 14. Alice Tully Hall. VLADIMIR ASHKENAZY This veteran pianist is many things, but you don't necessarily think of him as a Bachian. So his recording of both books of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'' should tell a lot. Is he just keeping up with the Barenboims, or is he doing them one better? April. Decca. May 'RODELINDA' Renée Fleming is far from my notion of the ideal Handelian, but if her star power is what it takes to get the thing on the boards, so be it. This was the sleeper hit at the Met last season, and the addition of the splendid German countertenor Andreas Scholl can't hurt. Opens May 2. Metropolitan Opera House. 'PAULUS' Kent Tritle is so busy away from his church job that you tend to forget just how much he continues to accomplish there, especially with his invaluable series Sacred Music in a Sacred Space. Here he closes the season (begun on Oct. 20 with Haydn's ''Creation'') with a lovable oratorio by Mendelssohn, a more youthful, less grandiose sibling to ''Elijah.'' Mr. Tritle's chorus and orchestra are sure to put it across stylishly. May 4. Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212)288-2520. www.saintignatiusloyola.org MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE Milton Babbitt spent many years as the ultimate insider in contemporary American classical composition. Minimalism, the New Romanticism and other trends have since radically altered the scene, leaving Mr. Babbitt somewhat on the outside, looking in. But it is touching to see his longtime champions stand by him: specifically, in a program celebrating his 90th birthday, the conductor James Levine and the pianist Robert Taub. May 10. Weill Recital Hall. 'PARSIFAL' With admirable magnanimity, James Levine stepped aside in 2003 and deeded one of his favorite operas, which only he had conducted at the Met in a quarter-century, to Valery Gergiev. But good will runs only so far in the world of Wagnerian Realpolitik, and Mr. Levine has reclaimed his podium. The starry cast includes Ben Heppner, Waltraud Meier, Thomas Hampson and René Pape. Opens May 12. Metropolitan Opera House. VERIZON HALL ORGAN FESTIVAL Great pipe organs are coming back into the concert hall, whether reinstalled, as at Severance Hall in Cleveland; rebuilt, as at Symphony Hall in Boston; or newly built, as at Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles. The Kimmel Center in Philadelphia, the home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, is also installing a new one, among the largest in the United States, built by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders in Lake City, Iowa. And the center will celebrate the installation with a two-week festival, beginning with concerts of the Philadelphia Orchestra. May 11-25. Kimmel Center, (215)893-1955. www.kimmelcenter.org EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK Before there was Richard Strauss, before there was Hector Berlioz, there was a great orchestrator: Jean-Philippe Rameau. Frederick Renz leads his period-instrument band in suites from Rameau's operas and ballets. The season brochure lists no specific repertory. It hardly matters; whatever it is, it is sure to sparkle. May 20. St. James's Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street, (212)280-0330. www.EarlyMusicNY.org PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The orchestra enters a brave new music-director-less world this season, with Andrew Davis acting merely as music adviser. So it is evidently improvising a bit on tours, traveling this time in regal style, with Christoph von Dohnanyi in a program including Bartok's deeply involving Divertimento along with works of Haydn and Tchaikovsky. May 23. Carnegie Hall. 'GRENDEL' Elliot Goldenthal is the composer, but Julie Taymor, as co-librettist, director and puppet co-designer, may be the prime selling point of this new work, a riff on ''Beowulf.'' Eric Owens sings Grendel; Denyce Graves, the Dragon. The production will travel from Los Angeles to the Lincoln Center Festival, which was a partner in the commission. Opens May 27. Los Angeles Opera, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, (213)972-8001. www.laopera.com June 'FALSTAFF' The Falstaff of choice these days is Bryn Terfel, whom you can hear sprawling through Verdi's bawdy comedy beginning on Sept. 23 at the Met. Thomas Quasthoff may never be a rival onstage, because of his physical limitations, but his earthy voice and outsize personality should make a powerful and affecting impact in concert performances. The ones here, with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Franz Welser-Möst, end the orchestra's season with the usual bang. June 8, 11. Severance Hall, (216)231-1111. www.clevelandorch.com YURI TEMIRKANOV For his first concert as music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, in January 2000, Mr. Temirkanov led a towering performance of Mahler's ''Resurrection'' Symphony. Now, with a nice symmetry, he offers the same work in his last concert as music director (and with the same vocal soloists, Janice Chandler-Eteme and Nancy Maultsby). For those with long memories, these performances should tell much about how the orchestra has fared under Mr. Temirkanov's watch.

Leon Botstein, the American Symphony's music director, offers another take on the Russian connection, posthumous as it is, and a refreshingly offbeat approach to the Mozart year with concert performances of two small operas: Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Mozart and Salieri'' and Dargomizhsky's ''Stone Guest,'' which takes its cue, via Pushkin, from the vengeful statue of the Commendatore in ''Don Giovanni.'' June 11. Avery Fisher Hall. DANIEL BARENBOIM It seems just yesterday that the players of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra were complaining about their new music director, Daniel Barenboim. But Mr. Barenboim has survived for 17 years. (So is there hope for Christoph Eschenbach in Philadelphia after all?) Now the orchestra bids Mr. Barenboim farewell in grand fashion, with three concerts, each including a valedictory ninth symphony: Mahler's, in the first program, with Elliott Carter's ''Soundings''; Bruckner's, with Pierre Boulez's ''Notations I-VII''; and Beethoven's, with his ''Choral'' Fantasy.

Each evening after work, Ms. Wagenknecht and her partners would step onto a dark and barren street.

The restaurant, modeled after the brasseries of Paris, was none other than Odeon, and it became no less than a late-night clubhouse for a whole generation of New Yorkers, the place where the go-go 80's played out. The art dealer Mary Boone was a regular, as were Lorne Michaels, John Belushi and Jay McInerney, whose novel ''Bright Lights, Big City'' featured an image of the restaurant on its cover.

Now some upstart cellphone companies are using high-speed wireless Internet access and content like video clips and MP3's to lure a smaller but lucrative audience: technologically astute teenagers and young adults. The new wireless company Amp'd Mobile plans to begin testing the waters this week. Though its campaign does not officially start until December, an offbeat teaser campaign will try to persuade potential customers to wait until the end of the year to sign up for cellphone service so they do not miss the introduction of Amp'd Mobile."

When you discover that the film was developed in partnership with the Campbell Soup Company and that Mr. Jones plays a man named Campbell, hopelessness over the ever imperiled future of free-thinking consumerism clashes with the seductive voice of Mr. Jones rising in your head, reminding you that Verizon will save you money on your long-distance cellular phone service. What a staggering surprise it is to find that the movie, ''The Reading Room,'' which has its premiere tomorrow evening on the Hallmark Channel, does not unleash the sins the circumstances of its production would imply. As William Campbell, a wealthy widower, Mr. Jones is permitted all the integrity available to him; never, for instance, is he forced to down a cup of chowder from a can."

For this renowned orchestra's many admirers in the New York area, Tuesday night's concert at Carnegie Hall provided a chance to find out how things are going.

Once you've been down the high-def path, you don't want to go back. Which is also why I've been so perplexed by all the hoopla surrounding the Disney-Apple deal announced a few months ago. In case you've been living in a media-deprived cave, Disney, owner of the ABC television network, agreed to allow people to download weekly episodes of two of its most popular shows, ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Lost,'' onto an iPod, a wonderful device for music, but one whose tiny screen forces you to squint to see video images.

Ringtones aren't a large piece of the $12 billion American music industry, but the mobile sector is one of the few in which executives foresee growth.

The digital lifestyle I see portrayed so alluringly in ads is not possible when the Internet plumbing in our homes is as pitiful as it is. The broadband carriers that we have today provide service that attains negative perfection: low speeds at high prices. It gets worse. Now these same carriers -- led by Verizon Communications and BellSouth -- want to create entirely new categories of fees that risk destroying the anyone-can-publish culture of the Internet. And they are lobbying for legislative protection of their meddling with the Internet content that runs through their pipes. These are not good ideas.

Yet neither of us was prepared for our evening-long tussle with a horde of rock 'n' roll barbarians. Their cudgels were cellphones. These boors stood with their phones held aloft during the show, intermittently bellowing the lyrics into it for the benefit of some unfortunate friend on the other end. The scourge included camera phones and larger digital cameras as well, scores of them. Their owners elbowed their neighbors, stomped toes and shoved. One disgruntled patron uttered a faint, ''Yo!

On radio stations across the country, it sounds like two things at once. Sometimes you hear the never-ending aftershocks of grunge; plenty of nth-generation alt-rock bands are still following the trail blazed by Nirvana and others. And sometimes you hear the still-burgeoning sound of emo, the sentimental punk offshoot; plenty of fresh-faced, girl-obsessed boys are finding ways to woo listeners beyond the confines of the Warped Tour. This is a culture clash that's also a musical generation gap: the 90's versus the 00's. (Sadly, it's starting to look as if the current decade will never get a pronounceable name.) You don't hear much talk about grunge these days, yet the sounds of the 1990's have endured, along with some of that decade's most perplexing fashion statements. (For starters: wool hats, worn indoors.) The veterans persist: Nine Inch Nails, Foo Fighters and Audioslave (formed from the remnants of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) all find themselves near the top of the rock 'n' roll heap. And a horde of popular but unheralded bands continue to crank out hits by recycling the mildly disaffected sound of 90's guitar rock: Nickelback, Seether and all the rest. Right now, the Florida band Shinedown is responsible for one of the country's most popular rock songs, a vaguely Soundgardenish power ballad called ''Save Me.''"

There's probably nobody who looks particularly good in the Katrina situation, with the possible exception of the military when they were allowed to act. Q. Should we build redundant networks so disasters don't knock out communications? A. I don't think so. In Katrina and most particularly in the tsunami, everything that was physically there was swept away. I doubt that we are going to be able to harden these things in enough locations so that it makes a difference, given the unpredictability of disasters. Rather, I think the answer is response and resilience in the network capability. Q. How could we have faster communications recoveries? A. There are two parts of the issue.

Hours before the Oscars ceremony, AT&T announced that it would again make a giant deal, agreeing to buy the BellSouth Corporation in a proposed $67 billion purchase that is scheduled to close early next year. The takeover will have a substantial impact on Madison Avenue because there have been so many agencies spending so much money on behalf of the two companies as well as their mobile communications joint venture, Cingular Wireless."

But there's one big difference: even though fans could hear ''So Sick'' on the radio for the last two months, they couldn't buy it at popular online services like iTunes or Rhapsody, or anywhere else for that matter. Breaking from the music industry's current custom, the singer's label -- Island Def Jam -- decided not to sell ''So Sick'' as an individual song before Ne-Yo's album hit stores last week. Label executives worried that releasing the track too early might cut into sales of the full CD -- a fear that figures heavily in the music world's lumbering entry into the digital marketplace."
