Born in Kansas City on December 10, 1921 to a prominent family in the area since the early 1800's. His family fortune was wiped out in the Depression and still only a boy; John found five jobs while going to school when most men couldn't find one. As a young man, he started out as a cashier for the securities firm of Harris, Upham. One day, he was asked to fill in for a stock trader who was sick. Though shy, he quickly showed he was a natural born trader ""not a charts and research"" trader but a visceral trader whose great instinct would benefit many people, for decades to come. In 1954, Big John was a managing partner of Uhlmann & Latshaw, which then merged with EF Hutton & Co. making him the youngest partner in Hutton's history. He rose to become Executive Vice President, managing director, member of the executive committee and director of E.F. Hutton Inc., the E.F. Hutton Group and E.F. Hutton International and his opinions on the economy have been widely quoted, and he was an oft-requested speaker. When most men retire, he did and became the Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer of B.C. Christopher & Company. Later, he left the brokerage business to become Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and owner of what he named Latshaw Enterprises, Inc., which included Latshaw Tools, Wescon Products Company, Anderson & Forrester, Coast Wire & Plastic Tech, Inc., and MC Electronics, and held positions at numerous other ventures. Civic duty ran in his family and President Harry Truman, who was friends with his uncle, Judge Latshaw, befriended him as a young man so John was always involved in politics not just as a contributor for local, state and national races but by devoting his time for his friends who ran for state office or working on national campaigns such as: running the Re-elect Nixon campaign for Missouri and Kansas for the landslide victory in 1972. Later, he was National Chairman of Democrats for Ford as he was, in fact, a life-long Democrat, which illustrates his independent spirit and preference for people not adherence to rigid ideas and he was a great supporter on both sides of the aisle. He was appointed His Majesties' Royal Thai Consul to the United States by His Majesty the King of Thailand. Years later, in 1983, at Saranrom Palace, Bangkok, Thailand, Mr. Latshaw was decorated by the Prime Minister of Thailand with the Chaturathabhorn of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant Award, the highest award given to a civilian, in honor of their contributions to Thailand. A decade later, he was decorated with The Knight Commander of the Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand at the Thai Embassy in Washington, D.C. He was also honored and made a Knight Hospitalier of Malta by the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem. He received the Citation of Merit for Outstanding Achievement and Meritorious Service in Business and Public Administration in 1957, the first year such an award was given by the University of Missouri.

He was an innovative thinker who refused to quit. He loved life and lived by his motto of ""making money and having fun - but not one without the other"" and made life, frankly, just more fun. A gentleman with a delightful sense of humor, and an impish grin, he always had a twinkle in his eye. In his teens, he could clear the dance floor but even at the end of his life, he could still make women swoon as they fondly recalled, ""he was the best dancer"". He was well known throughout the world but always proud to be from Kansas City - a city he loved so much and supported, and his adopted home of Naples, Florida.

A gentleman with a delightful sense of humor, and an impish grin, he always had a twinkle in his eye. In his teens, he could clear the dance floor but even at the end of his life, he could still make women swoon as they fondly recalled, ""he was the best dancer"". He was well known throughout the world but always proud to be from Kansas City - a city he loved so much and supported, and his adopted home of Naples, Florida. He was preceded in death by his parents, Edna Parker Latshaw and Ross W. Latshaw; his son, Henry John Latshaw III; his brothers, Parker Latshaw, Robert Latshaw, and sister, Mercedes Anderson. He leaves behind his two daughters: Lady Jaffray, Constance, and Elizabeth Albright Latshaw.<br><br>",

(HBO) TELL THEM ANYTHING YOU WANT: A PORTRAIT OF MAURICE SENDAK In 1964 Mr. Sendak's ''Where the Wild Things Are'' won the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished picture book of the year -- and almost overnight became a bedtime classic. On Friday the filmmaker Spike Jonze (''Being John Malkovich'') will bring the book's wolf-suited protagonist, Max, and its fearsome menagerie to the big screen. In this documentary from Mr. Jonze and Lance Bangs, filmed at Mr. Sendak's Connecticut home and studio beginning in 2003, the writer and illustrator, above, now 81, muses on the things that inspired his creations, from his difficult relationship with his parents and his bond with his older siblings, to his fascination with death. He also reveals his philosophy about communicating with children. ''Tell them anything you want,'' he says. ''If it's true, you tell them.'' The film features photographs from Mr. Sendak's early childhood and excerpts from his sometimes controversial works, including ''In the Night Kitchen,'' which features drawings of a naked boy and was No. 25 on the American Library Association's list of the 100 most frequently challenged books from 1990 to 2000. 8 P.M.

As expected, Fox said it had signed a multiyear deal with Don Imus, right, the host who was fired by CBS Radio and MSNBC two years ago after making racial remarks about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. His program was revived by the radio company Citadel and the rural television network RFD-TV, but Mr. Imus ended the television deal last month. The simulcast, to be shown from 6 to 9 a.m. Eastern time, is expected to buoy the low-rated Fox Business Network, which began in October 2007. Mr. Imus doesn't make financial news a regular part of his talk show, but Fox said the program ''will incorporate additional business news into its format.'' Notably, three of the anchors partially displaced by Mr. Imus's hiring will host a three-hour morning-news program on the network's Web site, FoxBusiness.com, from 6 to 9. The anchors of the Web show, Jenna Lee, Connell McShane and Ashley Webster, will also appear regularly on ''Imus in the Morning,'' Fox said. Alexis Glick, a vice president at Fox Business who now leads the network's 7 to 10 a.m. hours, will remain the host of the 9 a.m. hour. In a statement, Mr. Imus said: ''I love Fox.

Toy Pioneer Jack Friedman, who made his mark over his 50 year career with some of the most iconic playthings of our time, has died at the age of 70. Friedman, of Thousand Oaks, CA and originally from Queens, NY, was founder and Chairman for leading toymaker JAKKS Pacific, and founder of video game company THQ, Inc. Friedman launched some of the most successful toys in history, including the first movie toys for E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Michael Jackson dolls, wrestling action figures, Pac-Man plug it in and play TV Games and an array of innovative products for millions of children. Friedman died on Monday, May 3, 2010 from complications caused by a rare blood disease. He is survived by his wife Karen Friedman, and his children Brooke Porter and her husband Tom, and Tony Friedman, and his step children Shannon and Andrew Farrell. JAKKS CEO Stephen Berman said, ""Jack was a legendary toymaker and a real titan in our industry. He dedicated his talents to JAKKS Pacific for 15 years, and he will be sorely missed."" JAKKS Board of Directors said, ""We are greatly saddened by the passing of Jack Friedman. He was a visionary leader who guided the Company with wisdom and keen judgment. Toys were his passion, and his legacy will live on in JAKKS Pacific."" Friedman founded JAKKS Pacific in January 1995, and he served as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer through March 31, 2010. Under his leadership, JAKKS has grown into a Top 5 US publicly traded diversified toy company. Before JAKKS, he led LJN Toys until its sale to MCA in 1985, and then went on to form THQ, Inc. in 1989 and led it until 1995. Friedman was a generous philanthropist and supporter of the Company's JAKKS Cares program, which has benefited organizations such as The Toy Industry Foundation, Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times, The Special Olympics, Feed the Children, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Marine Toys for Tots and more. Under the program, the Company has donated over $40 million worth of toys and school supplies to children around the world. Friedman was a proud yo-yo champion and avid golfer, and recently retired from his regular duties at JAKKS Pacific to spend more time with his family. The funeral will be held at the Forest Lawn South Mortuary in Davie Florida on Friday, May 7th and there will be a Memorial Service at the Malibu Jewish Center on Thursday, May 13th.

Time Warner Cable's contract with Disney expires Thursday.''The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner Cable have made significant progress in our negotiations for continued distribution of ABC, Disney and ESPN networks and services,'' a joint statement released late Saturday read. ''We are now focusing all our attention on a successful conclusion of these efforts.'' Pressure has been mounting on both companies for months, with each aggressively asking viewers to pick a side - theirs - in television, newspaper and Web ads. Disney is seeking to pry undisclosed fee increases out of a reluctant Time Warner Cable.In a full-page ad that ran in The New York Times on Sunday, for instance, Time Warner Cable warned, ''While we've been working hard to reach an agreement, Disney has been threatening a blackout - and telling Time Warner Cable customers to switch TV service providers.'' (The detente came too late for Time Warner Cable to withdraw the ad.) Disney had been warning viewers that they could lose access to Oprah Winfrey's farewell season and college football games.Indications emerged last week that tensions between the companies were easing. On a Time Warner Cable blog last Wednesday, a spokesman, Jeff Simmermon, wrote of the Disney negotiators, ''I run into those guys in the hallway, in the bathroom, at the coffee machine - and they don't look like they're having any more fun than our people.''A smaller fee fight is also under way at AT&T, which is negotiating a new contract with Crown Media Holdings, parent company of the Hallmark Channel. Last week, the companies warned that Hallmark would be dropped at the end of the month from AT&T's U-verse service, which has about 2.3 million subscribers.Hallmark's president, Bill Abbott, said Thursday that AT&T was ''insisting on unreasonable rates that would seriously jeopardize our longevity.'' AT&T said it was ''making every effort to reach a fair agreement.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",

In September 2006, Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, announced news of the company's latest offering: the Apple TV. Mr. Jobs had high hopes for his latest creation, so high that he told his audience that he hoped the Apple TV would be a fourth leg to the Apple business among PCs and iPods and iPhones. When the Apple TV was unveiled a few months later in early 2007, Mr. Jobs reiterated these comments in an interview with USA Today:We've got two strong legs on our chair today - we have the Mac business, which is a $10 billion business, and music, our iPod and iTunes business, which is $10 billion. We hope the iPhone is the third leg on our chair, and maybe one day Apple TV will be the fourth leg.Yet it wasn't long before Apple downgraded its hopes of a living room accessory and fourth leg to its business, and Mr. Jobs started referring to the poor Apple TV as a ''hobby.''",

After a long career of covering world affairs in the United States and abroad for newspapers, wire services and public radio, Graham Hovey joined The New York Times in 1965, serving on its editorial board for more than 12 years, then working in its Washington Bureau as a foreign-policy reporter until September of 1980. Mr. Hovey passed away Saturday, February 20, 2010 in the Luther Crest community in Allentown, PA. He retired from The Times in 1980 to become professor of communications at the University of Michigan and director of Michigan Journalism Fellows, a program that provides an academic year of study and research for journalists at or near mid-career. After his official retirement at 70 in 1986, Hovey remained at Michigan as a professor emeritus to teach a first-year seminar on ""The Making of U.S. Foreign Policy."" He and his wife, Mary Jean, moved in 1998 to the Luther Crest retirement community in Allentown, PA to be nearer their son, Thomas D. Hovey. Hovey attended what is now the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, but transferred to the University of Minnesota, where he became assistant city editor of the Minnesota Daily and took his BA in journalism and economics in 1939. After two years as a reporter on the Waterloo Daily Courier in Iowa, he joined the International News Service (INS) bureau in Detroit in 1940 and covered the beginnings of the conversion of Detroit-area industries for war production. Hovey became a full-time sports writer for INS in Chicago in October, 1941. He was covering an intra-city football game in Comiskey Park between the Bears and the Cardinals when he learned of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. This effectively ended Hovey's sports-writing career for he moved to the INS cable desk in New York in March, 1942, and sailed for Africa in May as an INS war correspondent. Hovey left INS late in 1944 to become a foreign-affairs reporter for the Associated Press in Washington. Two years later he joined the New Republic as an assistant editor. But in 1947 he changed course to pursue an MA in political science and history and teach journalism at the University of Minnesota. He moved in 1949 to the University of Wisconsin, where he rose to the rank of associate professor. He also broadcast a weekly program called ""The Background of the News"" over the university radio station WHA and nine affiliated stations of the Wisconsin State Broadcasting Service. In 1953, Hovey took leave from Wisconsin to accept a two-year Fulbright grant to Italy, where he was accredited to Radiotelevisione Italiana and broadcast a weekly ""Letter from Italy"" for member stations of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters, a forerunner of National Public Radio. He returned to Wisconsin for the 1955-56 academic year, then joined the editorial page staff of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune, since merged as the Star Tribune. But he also covered international crises at the United Nations, winning the Overseas Press Club of America award for ""Best American Press Interpretation of Foreign Affairs"" and sharing a National Headliners Club award for his U.N. coverage in 1958. He was then sent to London in January, 1959, as the Minneapolis Tribune's first European Correspondent. After nearly seven years of covering NATO, the evolution of the European Common Market and Community and recurring crises with the Soviet Union over Berlin, Hovey accepted an invitation from John B. Oakes to join the editorial board of The New York Times in 1965. He wrote editorial and occasional signed columns on U.S. policies in Europe, Africa and the Americas, and often visited those areas. Hovey was married June 20, 1941, in Waterloo, Iowa, to Mary Jean Landgraf, a graduate of Columbia University's School of Library Science, who worked in libraries in Iowa, New Jersey, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Washington, DC, in addition to serving as her husband's researcher for writing and lectures.

(ESPN) THE 16TH MAN In 1995, just a year after the overthrow of apartheid and as the new government of Nelson Mandela was seeking to rebuild the nation, South Africa hosted the Rugby World Cup. Despite having only one nonwhite player, the South African Springboks gained the support of the country and, bucking heavy odds, beat the New Zealand All Blacks. Afterward, Mr. Mandela, far left, wearing a Springboks jersey, walked to the center of the pitch and shook hands with the team's captain, François Pienaar, above right -- a gesture seen as a step toward healing a deeply divided nation.

Mr. Bennett was born in Macon, Georgia on January 17, 1924 to Andrew Jackson Bennett and Mary Eloise Franklin Bennett. He graduated from Yale University in the war-shortened Class of 1945 and served as a U.S Navy Lieutenant (j.g.) on the destroyer U.S.S. Boggs in the Pacific during World War II. He worked in post-war Germany alongside his father who, as Financial Advisor to the U.S. Military Commander of Germany, was the principal administrator of the Deutschemark currency reform that reignited the German economy. On his return from Germany, he earned a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University in 1951. Mr. Bennett later moved to Washington, DC where he served in the War Department, the State Department, and the Executive Office of the President, and as the Economist on two Presidential Commissions, including the Fairless Committee on Mutual Security which focused on U.S. - foreign economic policy. In 1955, Mr. Bennett joined the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) and worked for its successor Exxon Corporation for over 30 years in New York, London, and Houston.

His work was instrumental to the implementation of the global movement to currency exchange systems based on floating exchange rates and the dismantling of U.S. controls over international capital flows. He also introduced the use of Dutch auctions in the sale of U.S. Treasury securities (still used today). He was awarded the Alexander Hamilton Medal by Secretary Schulz. He was an active Member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a Trustee of the Committee for Economic Development, and a member of the Bilderburg Group for which he also served as Chairman of the U.S. Friends of Bilderberg.

Despite the travails, B.C. has extended its streak of eight-win seasons to nine, with the potential for a sixth straight nine-win campaign with a victory Saturday. What about those Trojans?
