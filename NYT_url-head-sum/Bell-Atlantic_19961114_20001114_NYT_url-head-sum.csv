Richard A. Jalkut, the president and chief executive of Nynex's core telecommunications unit, said he would leave once the deal was completed, probably in April. Mr. Jalkut, a former president of New York Telephone, was to run network operations for the combined Bell Atlantic-Nynex. But he said the new assignment did not excite him, especially because he was already chief executive of the entire telephone business at Nynex, which involved both running the network and selling phone service to the public."
599,1997/02/13,Challenging the Telephone Merger,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/13/opinion/challenging-the-telephone-merger.html,"Attorney General Dennis Vacco of New York surely upset Bell Atlantic and Nynex by opposing their $23 billion merger. He may also have surprised Gov. George Pataki, who would probably rather not offend Nynex, a powerful constituent, or thwart a merger that promises to base itself in New York City. But Mr. Vacco's brief, filed with the Public Service Commission, is a cogent reminder why the merger could harm New Yorkers. Mr. Vacco points out that in the absence of a merger Bell Atlantic might, under the new telecommunications law, enter the New York market and compete for Nynex's customers. Indeed, Bell Atlantic once planned to provide local phone service by joining forces with a major cable operator. If the state approves the proposed merger, Nynex would be immunized against Bell Atlantic's presence. Mr. Vacco also fears that the proposed mega-company would scare others out of entering the local market, entrenching a monopoly, Nynex, which has a dismal customer-service record."

When the list was distributed electronically on Dec. 18, managers of both companies pored over it like a biblical text. On the face of it, the companies seemed to be sticking to their pledge that the $23 billion deal would be a merger of equals. Of the names on the list, 52 were from Nynex, 48 from Bell Atlantic."

The state commission gave Nynex, which is hoping to win regulatory approval by April 1 to merge with Bell Atantic, 30 days to pay $22.6 million in rebates to business and residential customers as compensation for poor service, and 90 days to pay the remaining $87 million in rebates that are a penalty for unethical practices in the 1980's."

720,1997/02/16,DIARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/business/diary-643599.html,"STOCK MARKET A Dow Record: This Is News? What, exactly, constitutes news? By the old rule, man must bite dog -- the opposite occurrence being so commonplace that it's not worth noting. So how about when the Dow industrials put another 1,000-point notch in their belt? The first few times it was sort of exciting -- but the milestones are being toppled so regularly now that it's rapidly sinking to the dog-bites-man category. The Dow topped 7,000 last week, you say? Hmmm. That and 20 redials might, if you're lucky, get you onto America Online. Why do stocks keep rising? Oh, round up the usual suspects: mutual fund money, low inflation, corporate profits, blah blah blah. And the pundits, with remarkably precise hindsight, are scrambling to say that, well, the rules have changed about what defines an overpriced market. Famous last words? WAGES A Raise? What a Thought Inflation's all but dead. The grim downsizing reaper still loiters on the street corner. A cost-of-living raise? Ha! Just be thankful you have a job -- and, while you're at it, grovel a bit. Yes, this is the way it was, but guess what: it's not really true any more. Employers nationwide are finding that they simply can't afford to keep being stingy, and wages are now rising at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, half a point above the inflation rate. No, that can't match the solid raises of the good old days -- the 60's and 70's -- but it's quite a change from the past few years, when raises all but vanished for many workers. So go ahead. Ask for a raise. For a change, the statistics are on your side. WALL STREET Lamborghinis? I'll Take Two Lest we forget, though: there are wages and there are wages. Light-years apart from the real world of pinched pennies and juggled bills lies the funny-money world of Wall Street, and it's never been funnier. It's the height of bonus season, and we're not talking about a few $100's in an envelope -- not by a long shot. After a giddy year in the markets, the securities industry's 150,000 workers in New York are getting about $8.1 billion in bonuses, far above the previous high of $6.2 billion, with perhaps 1,500 people making $1 million or more. So if you see some smooth-faced hotshots with million-dollar suits and fire in their eyes, better step aside: they've just received their bonus checks and are sprinting for the Lamborghini dealer. PHONE COMPANIES Good Service? Try Asking When Nynex merges with Bell Atlantic this spring, Bell Atlantic, it seems, will be setting the pace -- and that's probably just fine with Nynex customers. In a recent F.C.C. customer-satisfaction ranking, Nynex was a distant last. And last week, in fact, the New York Public Service Commission ordered Nynex to pay $109.6 million to its customers in the state for what it called a decade's worth of bad service. Here's a thought, though: in those droning long-distance wars, bargaining is creeping into the formula. If you don't like, say, 15 cents a minute, call and offer 10 -- and they just might take it. So just take this you've-gotta-ask-for-it approach a step further: Call Nynex (or whomever), and after you've lined up package rates and call-waiting, simply say, ''I'll go for the good service, too, please.'' FOREIGN POLICY A Compromise on Cuba? When historians sum up America's late-20th-century foreign policy, the comic relief will surely be supplied by our mounting frustration with Cuba. Our delicate sensibilities are so offended that this little island, practically on our patio, won't dance to our deafening tune that we come up with all manner of bizarre and convoluted laws to wreak our symbolic vengeance. One of the more bizarre: the Helms-Burton Act, which, basically, decrees that the rest of the world join us in ostracizing Fidel's ruffians -- or else. European nations, not at all happy being bullied this way, planned to take their outrage to the World Trade Organization. And Washington has countered by warning that it would argue -- this gets really strange -- that little Cuba actually poses a security threat. Last week, though, still hoping for a compromise, Europe postponed its challenge. CELLULAR DISTRACTION If You Talk, Don't Drive Status-conscious go-getters wouldn't dream of cruising along in their Grand Cherokees without talking with great earnestness into their cell phones. It's vital, after all, to stay in constant contact with your broker or lawyer or wine consultant -- or at least appear to be. But is this a high-risk status symbol? Common sense has long indicated that it is, but there's been no scientific backing -- until now. A study published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, in which Canadian researchers studied 699 phone-equipped drivers who'd had accidents, found that the risk of an accident rises fourfold when you're talking -- about the same as being legally drunk. There is some talk about restricting drivers' use of phones, but such a drastic step does not seem to be likely. Still, you can almost hear the new terminology: Stop D.W.C. -- driving while chatting. Or C.I. drivers -- conversation-impaired. And, now, it's no joke. GOVERNMENT SPENDING Funds for Family Planning Is family planning just another term for abortion? Abortion foes in the House have long thought so -- or voted so, at any rate, putting tight reins on money for family-planning programs around the world. But last week, prodded by President Clinton, the House voted to speed the release of family-planning money. ''American dollars shouldn't be used to kill innocent little children,'' one Republican argued. But another Republican countered that during every hour that he and his colleagues yammered about the issue, 250 women around the world would die during pregnancy -- deaths that could have been prevented by contraception. This stance won the day, as the House voted 220 to 209 to release $215 million in family planning funds on March 1. If the measure had failed, it would have been just $92 million -- on July 1. SHIFTING ECONOMICS And the Sand Goes Round There's really not much ambiguity left. A beach is washed away, you spend millions to dump more sand on it in a futile attempt to outsmart Parent Nature, and the new sand in turn is washed away. And on and on. But have we learned that beaches simply don't stay put? Of course not. Even now, $450,000 is being spent to dump 50,000 cubic yards of sand on Brant Beach on the New Jersey shore."

The rebels, mostly ethnic Tutsi from Zaire, said they feared epidemics and the presence of armed Hutu militia leaders. 1 Few Clues on Saudi Bombing The Pentagon lacks adequate evidence about the bombers who killed 19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia last year to warrant retaliation against foreign nations that may have helped them, said Gen.

The company, which offers local phone service in six mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia, said yesterday that its income rose 11 percent from the comparable period last year, to $515.6 million on revenues of $3.4 billion. But that increase excluded a one-time gain of $142.1 million that Bell Atlantic recorded in the first quarter of 1996 as a result of a change in its accounting methods. Including that gain, net income actually dropped 15 percent."

But the timing was accelerated and the financial structure was changed to allow U S West to spin off the $2.8 billion in Airtouch stock to its shareholders, rather than holding a continuing interest in the company."
750,1997/04/20,DIARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/20/business/diary-692310.html,"TOBACCO WARS $250 Billion? Cash or Check? Imagine your company was in an industry whose products were so harmful to society that it was negotiating to pay $250 billion -- yes, billion; up there with the Federal budget deficit -- over 25 years to get itself off the hook. Sounds devastating, no? But when the possibility of a sweeping tobacco settlement broke into the open last week, shares of both Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco leapt more than 10 percent. That sum, you see, staggering as it sounds, at least sets a limit on the tab of the cigarette makers, which are under vast legal pressure to pick up a good part of the nation's health care cost from smoking-related illness. And remember that the tobacco giants practically mint money -- Philip Morris just reported profits of $1.77 billion for a single quarter. It brings to mind the cartoon that depicted Michael R. Milken, after agreeing to pay $500 million in compensation for his misdeeds, looking up at the judge with a wide smile and saying, ''Cash or check?'' ADVERTISING High Noon in Marlboro Country The people negotiating the tobacco deal are reportedly considering a ban on, among other things, human characters in ads. But that would be ''a deal breaker,'' one analyst said. ''There is no chance in the world Philip Morris would agree to do away with the Marlboro Man.'' The ''Marlboro Country'' ads, after all, have had a bigger impact on the world's smoking than any other campaign. (John Landry, who oversaw development of the Marlboro Country ads in the early 60's, died last week at 73.) STOCK MARKET 10%? Time to Buy Again The stock market has all these odd little myths and formulas. If something happens in January, something else is supposed to happen in June. If a certain team wins the Super Bowl, it's curtains for stocks. And, of course, there's the old 10 percent rule: if the Dow industrials ever drop 10 percent from their high, that's heavy-duty stuff -- not to mention the end of the bull market as we know it. For six long years -- the longest stretch ever -- the Dow has skirted such a fate, but last week it danced on the precipice. After ending the previous Friday down 9.8 percent, the Dow ventured down into the danger zone on Monday. But then investors -- duly programmed to follow their myth -- seemed to say, ''Hey, we've had our heavy-duty market drop; now the water's safe again.'' And the Dow bounded back to gain 60 points, and 135 more on Tuesday, and it kept rising most of the rest of the week. TAX RETURNS Sacrificing for Politics President Clinton, often accused of just saying what people want to hear, didn't miss a beat last week. For even as Americans were racing against the tax deadline and swearing at the tangle of forms, Mr. Clinton offered a plan to simplify the whole process. Sounds familiar. Politicians talk constantly of tax simplification. One fun thing about tax time, though -- yes, yes, it's a stretch to call any of it fun -- is that the simple folk get to peek at politicians' returns. Last year, both Mr. Clinton and Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani, powerful as they are, made far less than their wives. President Clinton had his $200,000 salary, but Hillary Rodham Clinton made $740,000 on royalties from ''It Takes a Village'' (most of which she has donated to charity). And while Mr. Guiliani's salary is $165,000, Donna Hanover made $259,000 as an actress and TV journalist. THE GREAT UNTAXED Well, There's Still Death Those First Families, of course, also paid hefty taxes -- they'd never try the type of shenanigans most Americans seem to believe are hidden somewhere in the fine print of the Declaration of Independence. You'd think, for instance, that people making over $200,000, no matter how much tax-return creativity they mustered, would have to turn over at least a few pennies to the I.R.S. Not so. In 1993, according to the latest I.R.S. data, nearly 2,400 Americans with such lofty incomes paid precisely nothing in Federal taxes -- nearly 30 times as many as in 1977. One way they did it: someone could, say, earn $1 million, but lose $1 million (on paper) on a real estate investment and wipe out any liability. So much for the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to wipe out such stuff. LIFE INSURANCE H.I.V. Policies, at a Price Life insurance for someone who's H.I.V.-positive? Forget it. No insurer would touch you -- until now, that is. Last week, Guarantee Trust Life, of Glenview, Ill., became the first to offer such coverage, recognizing that new drug therapies mean that AIDS is no longer hopeless. For now, the policies are offered only in Illinois, but later they may be more widely available, and those who contracted the virus through drug use aren't eligible -- the company deems them too risky. But here's the big catch: a $250,000 policy costs $1,500 a month, or $18,000 a year. WIRELESS PHONES Phone-aholics, Please Apply These ads for wireless phones are getting downright silly. As competition heats up -- with new rivals for Bell Atlantic Nynex and AT&T Wireless in the New York area, and with new goodies like digital service -- innocent bystanders are being bombarded with pitches that often include absurd numbers of free minutes. One, for instance, offers 1,000 free weekend minutes a month. Think about it. That's two full hours, every weekend day. How would you ever use that? Take a six-mile hike and talk to your broker the whole time? Sit at a Little League game and chat endlessly on the phone instead of watching the field? Farfetched? Not necessarily. Bargain-hunting Americans just hate to get something free and not use it. If phone companies were sincerely interested in quality of life, they might offer incentives for people not to use these gadgets. HEALTH CARE All-in-One Cancer Care Say you need a widget. You go to the widget store, which might well be owned, or at least managed, by the widget maker. Sounds reasonable. But is health care just another business? Should it be? With the rapid growth of managed care, of course, health is getting to be very much a business, and when you consider things like efficiency and economy of scale, that might well be a good thing indeed. But is there a limit? That was the question last week when Zeneca, the British company that's the world's No. 2 maker of cancer drugs, took over the operation of its 11 cancer centers in the United States. ''This arrangement is a first,'' one analyst said. And no doubt not the last. CONTINENTAL WORLD Coffee, Tea or Broadway? Just as Florida has Disney World, for years New York had Webber World (though purists insisted on calling it ''Broadway''). But when ''Sunset Boulevard'' closed a few weeks ago, suddenly Times Square no longer seemed like Andrew Lloyd Webber's private playground. Never fear, though: the urge to make it a theme park hasn't died. Now, if you please, call it Continental World. When you weren't looking, the theater district somehow turned itself into a brand name, and last week the new, improved Broadway landed its first national corporate sponsor -- Continental Airlines. What now? ''We plan to do this tie-in very tastefully,'' said the president of the ''official airline of Broadway.'' And a theater official vowed that there'll be no ''dancing airliners in the middle of shows.'' Only, presumably, at curtain time."

671,1997/04/27,DIARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/27/business/diary-807850.html,"DAUGHTERS AT WORK Hopes, Not Sweatshops For many girls, Take Our Daughters to Work Day is a joyous, silly, possibly inspiring once-a-year event. For others, it is not a lark at all -- no giddy photocopying of hands or, perhaps, shoes at Dad's office -- but a day-in, day-out grind, because some girls spend their days shut up in New York garment factories. They might be 13-year-olds sweating at sewing machines, or 3-year-olds playing on the floor, and many are struggling Chinese immigrants. Now, as a protest, the nation's largest clothing union has piggybacked on the daughters'-day publicity bandwagon and created Don't Bring Our Daughters to Work Day. And it wants it observed every day. Does this offend the Ms. Foundation, mother of the original daughters' day? Not at all. ''It's great,'' the foundation's president said. She wondered, though, if society had the will to provide an alternative. ''Where,'' she asked, ''is the village?'' TELEPHONES Yearning to Be AT&T? Step by step, inch by inch, like shards of shattered glass straining to reassemble themselves, the telephone industry is moving relentlessly toward consolidation. Not that the latest step wasn't a struggle. It's been a whole year since Bell Atlantic and Nynex pledged to join into a mighty whole, and the Justice Department sniffed long and hard for antitrust scents. Many consumer advocates were wary, with one decrying ''the avalanche of telecommunications mergers'' driving prices up. But last week, removing the last real hurdle, the Justice Department signed off on the deal anyway, saying it spied no antitrust problems. The head of Bell Atlantic assured customers that ''telephone bills will go down,'' but one thing is certain: People who only recently started writing checks to Nynex, not New York Telephone, will be paying their bills to a Bell Atlantic that sprawls from Maine to Virginia. RATING CONSUMER REPORTS Samurai Strikes Back Would the folks at Consumers Union ever cheer as they tested products? Unthinkable. If ever a publication had a reputation for sober objectivity, it is their magazine, Consumer Reports. The thing practically drips with integrity -- at least that's the image it has doggedly built. Last week, though, Suzuki tried to poke a hole in that wall of virtue. Suzuki's Samurai, of course, also has an image indelibly rooted in the public mind: that it might tip over as you meander along a country lane. That blot on its good name, of course, came in 1988, when Consumer Reports gave the Samurai its damning ''Not Acceptable'' label, causing sales to plunge. Now, nearly a decade later, Suzuki says it was the testing that was not acceptable, accusing Consumer Reports of setting out to make the car tip just for the sake of a good story, with testers cheering when they finally succeeded. The magazine said the test was valid. RENOVATIONS (ENDLESS) Grand Central's Vital Signs Grand Central has been transformed forever into a construction wasteland, a labyrinth whose meandering plywood byways seem to change by the day. That, at least, is the way commuters see it, as the vast renovation drags on. And on. But the end is in sight -- late 1998, officials say -- and you know it's true because the capitalist wheels are most definitely turning. The 180,000 square feet earmarked for restaurants and stores is going fast, with likely tenants including Gotham Bar and Grill, Banana Republic, the downright oxymoronic Caviarteria, and -- did you doubt it for a second? -- Starbucks. New York, you see, couldn't stand being upstaged by Washington, with its glorious Union Station. And it won't be: Union Station doesn't have that glorious star-spangled ceiling. BLOCKBUSTER DREAMS Watch Out for 'Titanic'! When you come right down to it, the movie business in summer is nothing but a huge, vaguely comic game of musical chairs, with 300-pound bruisers dancing desperately around the same pitiful scattering of chairs. Those chairs, of course, are summer weekends, and no matter how big and fancy and high-tech the movies get, Hollywood simply can't create more of these prize landing slots. A blockbuster wannabe, you see, craves nothing more than having an opening weekend to itself. Moviegoers dutifully flood the theaters, and almighty box-office momentum is achieved. This summer is shaping up as an especially lively game: 10 weeks, at least 15 aspiring mega-hits. And to spice things up, ''Titanic'' -- the heftiest of them all, costing at least $180 million -- is having trouble deciding which chair to grab. It was set for the Fourth of July weekend, but might face a delay -- something to do with computer effects. If it plops itself down on another weekend, there'll be a mad scramble indeed. FORGOTTEN HOLLYWOOD You Must Remember This Yes, there's big money floating around Hollywood -- those summer biggies cost a staggering $100 million or more apiece. But it's instant money, somehow -- money with no memory, no past. Movies themselves, of course, are imbedded in memory -- any film buff can quote half of ''Casablanca,'' or summon instantly the image of Fay Wray wriggling and screaming in ''King Kong.'' But do Hollywood's millions keep flowing to the creators of those classics? No, not even thousands, not even hundreds. Julius Epstein, co-author of ''Casablanca,'' got $15,000 -- and nothing since. Well, almost nothing. He got $600 in 1960, but that covered past residuals for 35 films. Ms. Wray's husband, Robert Riskin, wrote classics like ''Meet John Doe,'' but there was not even enough money for his care after he had a stroke in 1950. Ms. Wray and Mr. Epstein, both 89, were among a Hollywood contingent that descended on Washington last week to lobby for a copyright law that would share the wealth of pre-1960 movies. In a business of ''$90 million severance packages,'' said Billy Wilder, the director whose films included ''Some Like It Hot,'' ''writers are just asking for enough to buy a little schnitzel.'' 58-CENT DREAM HOMES Many Rms, Lky Dungeon When it comes to dream homes, there are fixer-uppers and there are fixer-uppers. Sometimes a coat of paint and a bit of window caulking will do; other times you'll have flooded dungeons or crumbling turrets. Dungeons? Turrets? Yes, all this and more can be yours -- and for the pauperly sum of 58 cents, or one German mark. Eastern Germany, you see, has all these gorgeous old castles that are falling apart -- far too gorgeous, not to mention historic, to tear down. So, as a test, it's offering three of them for a mark apiece, with one small condition: you've got to fix them up, and do it right. The likely cost: $7 million or so. Another catch: they aren't in some stunning setting. One, for instance, is in Bautzen, in a region torn up by the old East German Government for coal mining. Then again, if you've got a castle with a dungeon and a VCR (not included), who needs to go out? STOCK MARKET Quick! Get the Pills! This stock market needs a tranquilizer. In the last few weeks, it's been like a manic, seesaw gang fight -- one gang, its nerves shot, itching to sell at the drop of a Greenspan mood; the other, equally jumpy, itching to jump in whenever it sniffs the almighty ''bargains.'' The resulting gyrations have become so commonplace that when the Dow industrials leaped 173 points on Tuesday -- a point gain second only to the surge after the '87 crash -- there was barely a blink."

Under the 1996 telecommunications law, they might eventually be able to turn to AT&T, MCI, Worldcom or other companies that might choose to enter the local phone market. But whether any of those options become possible depends on a series of decisions by the State Public Services Commission. The first, issued last month, appears to make it financially unattractive for Nynex's competitors to enter the local market for residential and small-business customers."

But as a result of the deregulation of the telecommunications industry, consumers may soon find they are unable to call some toll-free numbers from the nation's roughly two million public pay telephones. In a little-noticed move that could cost American consumers and businesses almost $1 billion a year, the Federal Communications Commission ruled in October that owners of toll-free numbers must pay a fee of 28.4 cents a call to owners of pay phones when customers dial a toll-free line from a public phone."

They assigned him a number that struck him as bland and forgettable -- seven digits, none repeating, arranged in a way that implied a lack of order in the universe. He declined. They gave him a choice of two more: one that ended in 2463 -- a stately, even-numbered staircase cut short by an odd 3. No, thanks. The other, 3192 -- a cluster of low roofs with an irksome skyscraper of a 9 sticking up in the middle. No way. For twenty dollars, the phone company offered him three more options, none of which appealed. Sixty dollars and nine more numbers later, he was finally presented with something to his liking -- an elegant descending series: 8765. Sold. In the furor over Manhattan's impending new area code, no one has mentioned that, quite apart from the nuisance of dialing eleven digits to call next door and apart from the social stigma of being branded an arriviste, 646 is a ho-hum number that could be assigned to anywhere, while 212 -- singsong and terse -- perfectly suits the tempo of the city. Like people, some numbers have style, others have none. And, as in people, style in numbers is hard to analyze -- a function of taste. Even so, certain numbers and sequences turn out to be almost unanimously pleasing."

Two years ago, the department began working with six cellular companies -- Omnipoint, Sprint, AT&T, Bell Atlantic Mobile, Nextel and Nextwave -- on a plan to install 120 new towers ranging from 100 to 120 feet tall, Mr. Dourgarian said.

Those days, like rotary telephones, are long gone. In 1997, takeovers became almost as important to this industry as dial tones. Clearly beating out the year's No. 2 telecommunications story -- the failure of any regional Bell company to offer long-distance service -- mergers, proposed and actual, became the biggest story in one of the nation's most dynamic industries (notwithstanding a Federal judge's bombshell ruling six hours before the year's end that invalidated broad swaths of the Telecommunications Act of 1996).

Last week's court ruling, which could be a bonanza for SBC and the other Bells, will probably be stayed from going into effect soon and could well end up in the Supreme Court. And SBC's takeover of the Connecticut company, the Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation, could be rejected by regulators."

SBC Communications, the parent of Southwestern Bell and Pacific Bell, proposed to take over Southern New England Telecommunications, the local phone company for Connecticut. Then, AT&T proposed to buy Teleport, a New York company that provides local phone service in more than 60 cities. Yet these are modest moves. So far, the 1996 act has spawned more court suits than competition. The SBC merger merely replaces one phone company with another, providing Connecticut no additional choices. But the merger does hold out the possibility that SBC will use Connecticut as a springboard to enter long-distance and local service for residential customers in the Northeast as a whole, thereby giving Bell Atlantic-Nynex a long-awaited run for its customers."

In exchange, Bell Atlantic will relinquish its monopoly over local phone service by opening up its wires and switches to AT&T, M.C.I. and other carriers.

It creates competition for local service among companies that offer both local and long-distance service with the convenience of one monthly bill. The 1996 Telecommunications Act promised such competition, but has been tied up in court by challenges from the Bells. The commission's feat is finding a compromise that persuaded Bell Atlantic to give up its monopoly even before exhausting its legal options. Bell Atlantic agreed to the deal in part because it was allowed to tack on surcharges -- fees in excess of costs -- for the use of its wires and switches by other carriers serving businesses."

But what he loved, what he gave up the beach for, skipped school for, quit sports for, what filled his free time and made his mind race, what never, ever bored him was work. ''I picked up my first lawn mower at 15,'' he says in a way that makes you envision Mickey Mantle reaching for his first Louisville Slugger. He started on neighbors' lawns. Then his mother, a waitress, began driving him around town, the power mower sticking out of the trunk of their Chevy. He took $250 from his earnings and bought a '58 Studebaker pickup to haul the mower. While still in high school he hired his first workers and began doing landscaping for businesses, too. When he realized that the lawn of practically every office building he wanted to cut had the same sign out front -- ''Property of Racanelli Realty'' -- he paid a visit to the large real-estate developer's headquarters. On a Monday at 9 A.M., dressed in a clean T-shirt, the teen-ager introduced himself to the receptionist. ''I'm here to discuss landscaping,'' he said. She told him the Racanelli brothers would be tied up all day. ''I'll wait,'' he replied. Around 4, he overheard her say, ''Marty, this kid's still in the lobby.''"

Still, the two sides agreed to meet regularly in an effort to avert future strikes."

Pro-Government troops appeared to have restored order in Kinshasa, but by all accounts the situation in the interior was far more confused. A1 NATO Approves Kosovo Plan The United States said NATO had approved plans for the use of force in Kosovo, where Serbian forces are carrying out an offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists. The announcement was intended to push Serbia to end the attacks. But no NATO official would discuss what actions in particular would prompt a response. A3 Fears grew about the fate of the tens of thousands of refugees in Kosovo who have been fleeing the Serbian attacks. Long columns of terrified civilians emerged from combat zones, where foreign monitors say homes are being burned and tens of thousands have been displaced. A3 Exile Says He Misled Times A Cuban exile who conducted violent operations against the Cuban Government has asserted that he deliberately misinformed The New York Times when he said in a series of interviews that leaders of the most influential exile organization in the United States, the Cuban-American National Foundation, had provided him with financial support. A7 Leftists Challenge Results A day after elections in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico, the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution challenged preliminary returns that showed its candidate for governor had come in second, saying the balloting was marred by fraud. A8 U.N.-Iraq Talks Breakdown Crucial talks in Baghdad on the remaining issues blocking the lifting of sanctions on Iraq collapsed in rancor, United Nations officials said. The Iraqis rejected a plan proposed by the United Nations chief arms inspector for Iraq, Richard Butler, saying he was using ''old tricks.'' A6 Israel to Release Palestinians Israel was reported to be preparing to free dozens of Palestinian prisoners whose release had been urged by Palestinian negotiators, apparently in an effort to rescue imperiled peace talks. A7 Muslims Attack in India Indian officials said Muslim rebels contesting Indian rule in Kashmir had crossed into a neighboring Indian state and shot to death 34 workers sleeping in two remote construction camps. A6 U.S. Remains Top Arms Dealer The United States remains the world's biggest arms merchant, filling the developing world's arsenals with billions of dollars of weapons, but Russia and France are poised to overtake the United States, a new Government report says. A5 NATIONAL A9-11 Calls for Clinton To Confess Are Rebuffed White House officials said President Clinton, who is to testify on Aug. 17, would continue to say that he had no sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky and was appealing a court decision ordering a top aide, Bruce R. Lindsey, to testify in the case. Several Clinton aides dismissed pleas from Republicans and some former officials that Mr. Clinton acknowledge an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, to blunt or even end the inquiry by the Whitewater independent counsel. A1 House Endorses Campaign Bill A House majority that included 51 Republicans defied the G.O.P. leadership and endorsed a bipartisan measure to overhaul the way the nation's political campaigns are financed, by effectively banning unlimited, unregulated donations to political parties. The 237-to-186 vote made it likely that the measure would prevail against several competing proposals. A1 Plan to Expand Medicaid President Clinton will announce new policies today making it easier for states to provide Medicaid to adults in two-parent families who work at low-wage jobs for more than 100 hours a month. Officials said the changes would help 135,000 to 200,000 people in 20 states. A11 Baby Mix-Up Takes Grim Turn The recent discovery that two baby girls were switched at a hospital maternity ward three years ago took a grim and even more complicated turn with the disclosure that the presumed parents of one baby died on July 4 in a car wreck. A9 MCI Agrees to a Refund An agreement between MCI Communications and the F.C.C. will provide credits to customers who used MCI's discounted ''dialaround'' service, known as 10-10-321, but who got billed at the company's highest rate. The 10-10-321 service is operated through TelecomUSA, an MCI subsidiary. The credits will be provided regardless of whether a person noticed the mistake or complained, the agency said. The commission did not estimate how much money was at stake. Under the agreement, MCI will work with Bell Atlantic to identify which customers were affected, the commission said. A glitch in new switching equipment was blamed for the errors.

His boss had bought a small regional airline and decided to make Mr. McManus its vice president of customer relations -- in addition to keeping him on as manager of showroom sales for the main business.

The previously announced portal site, which was code-named Cyclone and will now be called Snap, is intended to be a free guide and showcase for bandwidth-intensive applications, like video clips and audio files, by making them easier for users to find. ''This is the first shot in the next big battleground in the portal wars,'' said Edmond Sanctis, chief operating officer of Snap L.L.C. As evidence of a growing need for the sort of service he is introducing, Mr. Sanctis said that about 10 of the top 50 search words on Snap have been for some sort of ''rich media'' -- material with animation, video or audio, like the increasingly popular MP3 music format. Though the current market for high-speed Internet applications is small, it is seen by Internet content and access providers alike as an integral part of the on-line industry's future. At the end of last year, roughly 500,000 households had high-speed access, either through cable modems or telephone technology known as asymmetric digital subscriber lines, or A.D.S.L., though NBC said more than 14 million people have broadband access in the workplace. Forrester Research predicts that by the year 2000, two million households in the United States will have faster connections at home. That number could be accelerated, analysts said, by deals like one made in January that provides high-speed connections to America Online subscribers who are Bell Atlantic customers for an additional fee. Along with the official introduction of its new high-speed name, Snap will also announce today 20 alliances with content providers, distributors and advertisers. They include agreements with A & E Networks, the World Wrestling Federation, Tower Records, Pseudo Programs, and Inktomi. In deals with phone service providers like Bell Atlantic Internet Solutions, GTE Internetworking, Cable and Wireless, and 12 others, customized versions of the new guide will be available."

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 promised consumers the benefit of competition. Subject to rules that would be written by the Federal Communications Commission and negotiations with state regulators, the legislation would require local Bell companies to rent their wires, switches and phone services to competitors like AT&T, MCI Worldcom and Sprint so that they could enter the market for local service. In return, the Bell companies would be permitted to offer long-distance service. The F.C.C. issued rules, but many were set aside by the courts, leaving the states to negotiate in a legal vacuum."

The Federal Government seized the 641-room hotel in 1994, at a time when roving bands of drug dealers and addicts had taken over entire floors, terrorizing elderly tenants and creating an intolerable neighborhood nuisance. Slow going in eviction proceedings in housing court against tenants identified as drug dealers held progress back in the early years."

In 1954 Mr. Wein started the Newport Jazz Festival, which became the paradigm for outdoor music events. After moving through several different sponsors, it became the JVC festival in 1984. Mr. Dorf put on his first jazz festival (called ''What Is Jazz?'') at the Knitting Factory, his club in lower Manhattan, in 1988, scheduling it to compete with the JVC concerts uptown. A cordial relationship developed, but it broke down in 1997, when Mr. Dorf expanded, found a major sponsor (Texaco), and called his giant festival the New York Jazz Festival. This was the student rather stridently pulling rank on the teacher, and a period of bad blood followed. Jazz is too small for a brand war like this, and detente was probably inevitable. Friendly again, they're both committed to making New York a city overrun with jazz each June, resolving that too much at once is the best way to draw fans to the concerts. This year, Bell Atlantic Jazz (the festival has a new sponsor) runs from June 3 to 13 and JVC Jazz from June 14 to 27."

He is an alto saxophonist whose connection to Charlie Parker is always clear in darting movements and clear articulation, and his greatest departure from the main line of jazz esthetics currently is in the hard, slapping Afro-Cuban drumming that lies behind his work. It's partly an interpretation of Yoruban religious music, the kind that accompanies Candomble and Santeria ceremonies, and it replaces the airy netting of swing and bop rhythm with a kind of beautifully detailed concrete wall. As played by Sean Rickman on a normal drum kit (no congas, no unusual percussion), those layered drumbeats -- at times machinelike and done at brutally fast tempos -- were the sounds that lingered in the mind after leaving the Knitting Factory on Thursday, the first night of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival."

But even the most outre rock band in the world has become more patient with age: it's now after continuity and profundity, and the Boredoms have figured out that repetition is the quickest route to the profound in popular music. The band's remarkable set at the South Street Seaport Atrium on Wednesday night, part of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, operated like gospel music at its most urgent: it set up a short chant over a sea of rhythm, repeating it endlessly, bringing the energy level up higher and higher until you thought it had to stop or mutate.

Quite similar to how it sounded on its first recording, in 1995. Mr. Zorn compartmentalizes his music into projects, and each has its set of rules. These imposed limitations are what separates Masada -- a group influenced by Jewish music in its melodies and by Ornette Coleman's harmonic and rhythmic concept of the early 60's -- from the main body of jazz. The abstract supposition of jazz is that it can build on plenty of musical forms, stretching and mutating in any direction from night to night; the ''group sound'' of the great working bands is an identifiable means that can lead to all sorts of ends. Masada regularly performs on a scale between good and great, but one does know beforehand what it's going to sound like. It's all about ends, and thus it stays specifically a Zorn band, rather than generally a jazz band."

The other band -- the headliners, actually -- will be the New York Art Quartet, a reconvened avant-garde jazz chamber ensemble whose second of two albums was released only in Holland more than 30 years ago, and whose original members -- the trombonist Roswell Rudd, the alto saxophonist John Tchicai, the drummer Milford Graves and the bassist Lewis Worrell -- subsequently fell by the wayside. This is no act of charity by Thurston Moore, Sonic Youth's founder and guitarist, and an ardent devotee of 60's free jazz. The show might be one of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival's hottest tickets even without Sonic Youth as the opening act, such is the anticipation about the reunion of Mr. Rudd and Mr. Tchicai, who have not played together since the New York Art Quartet's breakup in February 1966 and who perform in New York individually only once in a blue moon. They will be joined tonight by the only slightly less elusive Mr. Graves, with Reggie Workman replacing the long-lost Worrell on bass, as he did on ''Mohawk,'' the band's 1965 album for Dutch Fontana, and for its legendary concert that same year in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art. The poet Amiri Baraka will be an added starter with the band tonight, as he was for one track of its self-titled 1964 debut on ESP Disk -- the infamous ''Black Dada Nihilismus,'' with its call for black revolutionaries to rape and murder in the service of liberation."

Yet an avant-garde that doesn't depend on shock value need not become obsolete. Instead, it turns into both a messenger from the era that shaped its attempts to break free and a guardian of its favorite extremes. The Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival ended on Sunday night at the South Street Seaport Atrium with representatives of two avant-gardes: free jazz from the New York Art Quartet, which formed in 1964 and disbanded in 1966, and avant-rock from Sonic Youth, which formed in 1981."

Mr. Jackson fused jazz and rock about as well as anybody in the 70's and 80's, dodging the cliches and developing a tough, extreme performance style. He hired promising young sidemen like the guitarist Vernon Reid and the bassist Melvin Gibbs, and his enthusiastic, splashy drumming spoke for itself. He was an original blender of heavy music; two decades after his prescient example, metal has essentially turned into hard funk with roaring guitars. Before Friday night he hadn't played with Mr. Reid and Mr. Gibbs, core members of his old sextet, the Decoding Society, in 13 years, and hadn't played at all in New York for a long stretch. In a show at the Knitting Factory for the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, a bit of exercising before heading into the studio, he renewed those old relationships. One might have expected the music to be dated, but it wasn't."

But its esthetic limitations are counterbalanced by its inherent nature as a social music at a time when jazz was beginning a long withdrawal into intellectualism and concert halls. Even in the music's recycled life as samples that have shown up in dance tracks of the 90's, it's still made for the body. So steering two of its original practitioners -- Big John Patton and Reuben Wilson -- into a synagogue with superdeep acoustics, as Blue Note Records did Sunday night, at the Angel Orensanz Foundation on the last night of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, required a little tailoring to the situation."

Jazz is patriotism, American genius, our home-grown cultural aristocracy. People who really love jazz routinely misunderstand the scale of its popularity; they wonder why the pride of American culture doesn't have a large audience. One result of this attitude, in the case of New York's two big summer jazz festivals, Bell Atlantic Jazz and JVC Jazz, is that ''jazz'' -- the construct, the marketing word, the mystique -- is too expensive to be supported by the music itself. The jazz needs to be supported by other forms of music that share its audience (a tradition of jazz festivals since the late 1960's) and by nostalgia, which is more problematic. Nostalgia never fails to sell tickets but usually results in lackluster shows."

Instead, Lippmann wrote, these ought to be handled by ''a specialized class'' of experts working closely with top Government officials. Today, such a notion of good government sounds haughty and simplistic. But something very like Lippmann's construct was adopted, just a few years later, by an organization leading the budding consumer movement. This time, the mandarin approach was a great success. That organization is now known as Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. Because of its dependence on scientific experts to answer questions about, say, why one vacuum cleaner is better than another, Consumers Union might fairly be called one of the most elitist institutions in American life. It is also one of the most influential. But the pendulum that swings from rule by the masses to rule by the elite never really stands still, even when it comes to shopping. Today, the primacy of Consumers Union is being challenged by a rival whose opinions derive not from experts but from Lippmann's dreaded public: J.D. Power & Associates."

The boxes contained three copies of Bell Atlantic's application to sell long-distance communications services to consumers and businesses in New York State. If the petition is granted, Bell Atlantic will become the first regional Bell admitted to the $80 billion long-distance market."

William E. Kennard, the commission chairman, has typically been circumspect in his public pronouncements about large mergers destined to come before him.

To hear him lovingly describe its clickety dial, the chime of its two-toned ringer and the shiny Bakelite handset (the size and weight of which make him feel small in comparison when he picks it up), Mr. Walz could just as well be referring to a long lost toy truck, or even an old teddy bear.

But some of the mergers designed to make local phone service better risk constraining what viewers can see on their cable systems, threatening the diversity of information that is central to democracy. A scorecard was needed to keep track of all the recent maneuvers. Bell Atlantic, the largest local phone company, asked the Federal Communications Commission for permission to enter long-distance service, where it would take on AT&T, MCI Worldcom and Sprint, thereby increasing competition. But then MCI Worldcom and Sprint decided to merge, a move that would lessen competition. Meanwhile, the commission approved the merger of SBC Communications and Ameritech, two large regional Bell companies. It also approved rules that will make it easier for AT&T, a huge cable operator, to take over another cable company, Mediaone, putting about 60 percent of American households within reach of AT&T's cable programs."

Within three years, SBC intends to offer high-speed cyberspace links to 80 percent of its customers using a technology called digital subscriber line, or D.S.L., which uses normal telephone lines. SBC recently completed its acquisition of the Ameritech Corporation, the Midwestern telephone giant, making SBC the local phone provider for about a third of the nation's roughly 100 million households.

One answer was obvious: a sense of the experience of everyday life -- the sights, sounds and sensations that time washes away almost instantly. For the Times Capsule, we set out to document the texture of life today, at least in a single place at a single moment. And so, on Sept. 9, 1999, at 9:09 a.m., a moment chosen strictly for its symmetry, more than a hundred writers, photographers, artists, sound recordists, filmmakers and students fanned out across the five boroughs to document a single minute -- the same minute -- in the life of New York.

The mayor's daily 8 a.m. staff meeting, in City Hall's Committee of the Whole Room, first used by Mayor DeWitt Clinton in 1812, is running late, the definition of any mayoral meeting of any century. The morning light coming in through the windows of the Federal-style room illuminates aides seated around a gleaming mahogany table, watching Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani listen to his commissioner of the administration for Children's Services, Nicholas Scoppetta. Scoppetta briefs Giuliani about a rally the mayor will attend for directors of the city's foster-care agencies. When Scoppetta mentions a judge who is expected to be there, the mayor, perhaps aware that his New York minute is not yet riveting, or maybe that he is not yet the central character, makes a move. ''Do I get my money for jury service?'' he breaks in, referring to his service as a juror days earlier in a personal-injury case. Scoppetta, absorbed in his presentation, at first takes no notice. ''And he,'' Scoppetta continues, ''he will bring--'' ''A check?'' offers the mayor, to laughter. ''A check,'' says Scoppetta jovially, catching on, just before the minute is over.

Seung-lae Lee, the proprietor, my cousin, presides over his short-order cooks cracking eggs onto the griddle, two by two. ''Pretty busy this morning,'' he says. And so it is. In this get-to-work rush, the customers line the length of the front counter, each waiting for their breakfast sandwich or bagel to be wrapped in foil and passed over the gleaming glass case. They stand, watching the action, with an uncommon New York patience, for they know it'll be just another minute. Behind the counter, the people-machine is running in high gear, the orders taken and called out, the responses barked back, the talk flying forth in Spanglish and English and Koreanese. Lee's wife is directing it all, shouting, ''Yo, amigo,'' and ''Yes, ma'am,'' and ''Coffee, coffee, ha-rha-buh-gee [grandpa in Korean]?'' her addresses wholly indiscriminate and sweet. Somehow, everyone understands. The two cashier girls ring it up, making change in their heads, their hands moving at the light-speed of a dollar being spent in Manhattan. This is not virtual commerce. Lee knows this, and takes a few overflow orders himself, relaying them to the griddle men, who shout it out, starting the business all over again. ''Not bad today,'' Lee says, surveying his buzzing empire. ''It's working.'' B - Edwidge Danticat Utica Avenue and Avenue D, East Flatbush Edwidge Danticat is the author of ''Breath, Eyes, Memory'' and, most recently, ''The Farming of Bones.'' Gray overcast minute in East Flatbush, a mostly African-American and Caribbean neighborhood. Landmark: Taste the Tropics Ice Cream, its parrot-green awning half covered with a swirling rainbow, linking three palmettos to a giant ice-cream cone. Car horns blare as ''dollar cab'' drivers race to get to the B46 bus stop to scoop up passengers before the bus arrives. For an even dollar each, the elderly caramel-skinned woman in a nursing uniform and the young boy in crisp navy pants, white long-sleeved shirt and a navy Catholic school tie will ride down Utica Avenue in a sleek leather-interior Lincoln Town Car and reach their destinations much faster. The Lincoln darts in and picks them up just in time, before the bus arrives. The co-owner of a new custom-upholstery shop, Austin wishes he could be somewhere else. ''In bed, maybe?'' Or perhaps on one of those trips advertised on yellow cardboard in the window of Astral Travel, across from Taste the Tropics. For $388, one can journey to Trinidad, Grenada or Haiti; a trip to Senegal, on this day of nines, is fittingly priced at $999. M - Susan Minot West Ninth Street Susan Minot is the author of ''Monkeys'' and, most recently, ''Evening.'' In the lobby, a fan is going on the battered desk. No doorman. A sign: ''They are working on the Elevator. Is out of order.'' I step outside. Down the street is the building that served as a model (built in a Hollywood studio) for ''Rear Window,'' Hitchcock's ode to voyeurism. No one this morning looks at one another. A stocky woman in a suit bustles toward the subway, rooting around for something in her bag; an Indian couple walks dreamily arm in arm; a woman with hair still wet holds her chin high. A man in a blue shirt tends his dog. The clock on the brick tower of the library, which used to be a courthouse, says 9:09. Walking toward me with a brisk pace is the shrink I used to see some years ago, someone who has peered in the window of many people's dramas and imbroglios and minutiae, mine included. She walks quickly by, not meeting my eye. 1,022,827 gallons of water and 7,890 megawatts of electricity flowed into New York City. 135,000 phone calls were placed or answered. M - Al Gibson, Mike Panarella and James Mennella 3 Times Square Fifty workers constructing the new Reuters Building on Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets were given disposable cameras to record the minute. Gibson and Panarella are crane operators on the project. Q - Leigh Holtzin the N Train, between Queensboro Plaza, Queens, and Lexington Avenue, Manhattan Q - Jan Staller Queens, construction of a new Water Tunnel M - Marilyn Church 100 Centre Street Judge Carol Edmead of Arraignment Court speaking with Michael Borba, the bridge officer who hands her the arraignments. M - Ken Kerbs New York Stock Exchange M - Grand and Forsyth Streets (left), broadway and wall street (right) Anthropology students from Barnard and Columbia collected garbage that was deposited in trash receptacles during the minute. M - James Traub The United Nations James Traub is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine. Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, left an elevator with his bodyguard and entered a television studio where he was scheduled to tape two messages -- one to ''the world business community,'' the other to employees of Unesco, a U.N. agency. Annan, who had been preoccupied for weeks with the conflict in East Timor, sat down before a mirror to be made up. He was as still as a mannequin, and he wore the muted uniform of the institution man: navy suit, white shirt, red and blue tie. Annan's white hair and goatee made his large, sleepy eyes look impossibly black. When an aide stuck his head through the curtain and said sorrowfully, ''There is a problem with the teleprompter, sir,'' Annan remained expressionless for a moment and then said softly: ''I'll do it another time. Now I can go talk to East Timor.'' B - Nicholas Dawidoff Yankee Stadium Nicholas Dawidoff is the author of ''The Catcher Was a Spy,'' a biography of Moe Berg, and ''In the Country of Country.'' Thomas Fyfe headed for the batter's box at Yankee Stadium. He carried a rake. Fyfe works as a groundskeeper at the most famous baseball field in America, and at 9:09 a.m. he stood alone on the vast green lawn surrounded by 57,746 empty seats, tamping and prodding the muddy clay around home plate. Pausing for a moment, Fyfe looked out across the dew-soaked outfield and noticed things only a groundskeeper sees. In right field, a sea-gull feather lay on a tired stretch of sod that Fyfe refers to as ''O'Neill's spot'' -- a patch of grass the outfielder Paul O'Neill wears down with his vigorous pacing between pitches. An open gate in left-center revealed two tomatoes heavy on the vine in the bullpen garden. In shallow-left, near the stands, were two ballpoint pens, misplaced, Fyfe thought, by fans hoping to receive an autograph. ''Now's the best time in the world,'' he said. ''There's nobody here. You just come out and work.'' M - Cathleen Schine 76th and West End Avenue Cathleen Schine is the author, most recently, of ''The Evolution of Jane.'' In ''The Pursuit of the Millennium,'' the historian Norman Cohn illustrates the five ways in which medieval millennialists identified salvation. 1. It will be collective. We're here, together, waiting for the same thing. . . . 2. It will be realized on this earth. Grinding din of workmen digging up street, heaviness of humidity. . . . 3. It is imminent. Man on cell phone, hand held out with casual certainty. . . . Two women, both in black suits, competitors, eye each other, ready to pounce. . . . 4. It will be total -- utterly transforming life. An undeniable truth in heavy rain. Or when it's freezing and you're not properly dressed. Or when you're late. Like increasingly frantic father with son's backpack. Mother, with squirming daughter, waving wildly. . . . 5. Finally, it will be miraculous. Yes. Only one of blind mystical faith like the man with the cell phone, hand still out, can really expect one now. The others peer irritably into the distance. Lights atop yellow cabs unlighted -- inauspicious. But then. . . . A golden gypsy slows, sparkles beside the believer, blinks its headlights. . . . Just one. . . . The left. . . . It's a sign! It's a taxi. M - Eleanor Randolph Astor Place Eleanor Randolph is a member of the editorial board of The Times. Jerry DeLakas stands alone in his compact green newsstand, surrounded by a panorama of urgent headlines. ''Virus Scare Grows'' shouts Page 1 of The Daily News -- mosquitoes have caused an outbreak of ''encephalitis,'' three deaths in a city of seven million people. Newsday features a postman with bug spray in his mailbag. The stand is oddly quiet. DeLakas smokes, a hazard made worse by his habit of storing his burning cigarette in the middle of a stack of magazines while he makes a sale. Suddenly a man in overalls rushes up, pays for a copy of the Spanish daily El Diario and then begins running back to the street. ''My truck stop there,'' he points to the reason for his urgency. ''No make me get ticket,'' he calls over his shoulder. With 10 seconds left in the minute, a lean man darts into the newsstand, grabs The New York Times, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal and leaves a small wad of bills. Engrossed in his cell phone, he waves off the change, a far bigger deal clearly hanging in the balance. Only once does he slow down -- to explain to me that he cannot stop. A sampling of the books returned to the Brooklyn Public Library in Grand Army Plaza: E.B. White, ''Charlotte's Web''; James Herbert, ''Portent''; David Eddings, ''Sorceress of Darshiva: Book Four of the Malloreon''; Amanda Quick, ''Reckless''; Wanda Ga'g, ''Millions of Cats.'' M - Alex Witchel Grand Central Terminal Alex Witchel reports on style for The Times. Her flowered skirt sways above her ankles, like curtains in a breeze. She makes her way intently around the circular beacon that is the Information Booth in Grand Central Terminal, oblivious to the streams of men charging off the escalators, wielding briefcases big and battered. She walks first past the red schedules, the green, then the blue, selecting one of each -- Westport, Greenwich, Tuckahoe -- as if she were choosing fruit. She passes through the line of harried questioners (''Can you tell me how to go to Metuchen, N.J.?'') and drifts past the man who sets his coffee cup on the shelf holding the schedules, knocking some to the floor, where they lie, ignored. Her journey complete, she files her stack carefully in her black shoulder bag. Knowing now how to get to every New York suburb at every hour of the day, she turns her back and heads toward the subway. B - Charles Siebert Brooklyn Bridge Charles Siebert is the author of the forthcoming ''Angus,'' a memoir of a dying dog. At the top of the Brooklyn anchorage ramp, a well-heeled woman stops to wrestle a homeless man over the trash can he has just spilled onto the promenade, thrashes him with her briefcase, picks up scattered newspapers and puts them back in the container as he canes his way toward the next one. Nearly 10 minutes gone of the official workday, these are the late crossers. No eased faces in the mounting heat, all grimace and climb, traffic so dense you worry for its destination, start counting the city's vertical panes against the passing eyes and windshields here, some incalculable yet daily resolved equation between the onslaught and the eventual settle. The sun slides into view. From unseen roadway scaffoldings below, jackhammers and lug wrench whines, the nuts and bolts, the underpinnings of flight being tended to. M - Joan Liftin Washington Square Park B - Erin Patrice O'Brien Beth Jacob School, Boro Park, Brooklyn M - James Mennella 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue M - Timothy (Speed) Levitch Sixth Avenue and Eighth Street M - Benjamin H.

Except for the distant drone of a lawn mower and the higher-pitched whapping sound of an edge trimmer somewhere out of sight, all is stillness on this grassy hilltop in New York's ''Garden City of the Dead.'' In the shadow of an imposing bronze statue of Minerva, Charles Higgins, the inventor of India ink, slumbers in a heavy, banklike mausoleum. Some yards behind him, the remains of the musician Leonard Bernstein lie under a simple marker set flush into the ground. Five small stones have been placed on it. Half a million people are buried in this cemetery, and five more are lowered into it every day. They tell me that 135 groundskeepers maintain these 478 lush acres, but all I know is not a single living soul came into view during the minute I stood watch. Esmeralda Santiago Southbound tollbooth plaza, Henry Hudson Bridge Esmeralda Santiago is the author of ''When I Was Puerto Rican'' and, most recently, ''Almost a Woman.'' A Dodge Intrepid cuts in front of a Lexus. The Lexus driver curses and gives the finger to the Intrepid, which then weaves in front of an Eclipse. An Explorer sidles up to a Beetle, hovers next to it until its driver notices, then signals right. A Navigator balks between the Cash Only and E-ZPass lanes, blocking everyone behind. A Pathfinder noses the Navigator, which stops dead in its tracks. A yellow cab takes advantage of the Navigator's hesitation and guns in front of it, followed by a Caravan. An Expedition tries to make the same move, but the Navigator lurches forward, heading, finally, triumphantly, for the E-ZPass. One arrival at Newark International Airport (US Airways Flight 1122, from Pittsburgh) and one departure (Continental Flight 1083, to West Palm Beach, Fla.). One departure at La Guardia (United Airlines Flight 347, to Denver). No arrivals or departures at John F. Kennedy International. B - Harvey Shapiro Brooklyn Promenade Harvey Shapiro is the author, most recently, of ''Selected Poems.'' There they are the water-hugging giants of Manhattan breathing the dun-colored air of morning. Silent, mysterious seen through a white scrim of fog. Directly beneath me, commuter traffic of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Across that, on the Brooklyn docks one lone forklift tractor, loaded with steel rods, jockeying back and forth before the Strober Bros. Building Supply Depot. Across the water, dimly descried, nested in the green arches of Battery, a perky yellow Staten Island Ferry. But the buildings pulsing in their various shades of white and now, as the fog thins slowly, a pale dusty blue, out of Giotto, seems to descend behind them. These mighty presences at the end of Manhattan Island, fronting the East River that is not a river but a tidal strait carrying the North Atlantic to our very doorstep. These monuments that dominate our day as if they had been fixed there forever though they are in flux as the waters are in flux. They stand before us like tribal gods meting out success and unsuccess, all that we have to lift our eyes to. M - Pete Hamill Broadway and Canal Street Pete Hamill, former editor of The Daily News, is the author, most recently, of an illustrated biography of Diego Rivera. At 9:09, the street light changes and trucks roar into life along Canal, crossing Broadway, heading east to the Manhattan Bridge, west to the Holland Tunnel: gru, gru, grug, gu-grug, groooaaaaar. Pedestrians rush across Broadway: two Chinese girls in high heels speaking English; a tan woman with a dragon tattooed on her bare back, sipping coffee as she walks; a fat guy in a Ralph Lauren shirt hurrying across on dainty feet right behind four students with backpacks and baggy jeans. All easing past one another, avoiding collisions, hurrying. A young Latina woman, copper-haired in the morning sun, wearing a tailored tan suit and carrying a briefcase, strides through the jumbled crowd, cutting a path. A large woman in a blue dress pauses to light a cigarette, her face desperate and sweaty, while others move around her. A tiny gray-haired Chinese woman in slacks and blouse, carrying a heavy shopping bag, hurries along, as the light turns to DONT WALK and a Bell Atlantic truck makes an abrupt turn out of Canal, heading directly at her. She freezes in the truck's path. The driver stops, gives her a small wave; she nods and waves back and hurries on, into her American morning. M - Jack Pierson Churchill Park, Bleecker and Downing Streets B - Yvette M. Sohl Central Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn M - Nina Berman Central Park West and 81st Street Madeline Greenberg, in her apartment, gets some help from her nurse, Judy Dennis. B - Angel Franco Viele and Tiffany Avenues, Hunts Point, The South Bronx Roxxanne, a 27-year-old prostitute, in front of the lot where she lives. Originally from Maine, she came to New York 12 years ago. M - Carrie Boretz P.S. 165, West 109th Street Genesis Frias is not at all happy about returning to school. Struggling all the way, she is led into her first day of second grade. M - Julia Topolski West Ninth Street, between Broadway and University Place M - Lewis Lapham The Carlyle Hotel dining room, Madison Avenue at 76th Street Lewis Lapham is the editor of Harper's Magazine and the author, most recently, of ''Lapham's Rules of Influence.'' A high-ceilinged room decorated with the reassuring signs of serious money: English hunting scenes by Fores on walls faced with brown velvet, fresh flowers (Casablanca lilies and curly willow) against a background of old botany (the engravings by Redoute), the pattern of the breakfast china matched to the chintz on the center banquette, the coffee priced at $5, the poached eggs on smoked salmon at $22.50. The 28 tables accommodate a tasteful selection of fine guests, as reassuring as the decor in their dress and appearance: custom-made shirts, German accents, warm suntans lately arrived from Cape Cod and California, a small but important collection of gold jewelry. The two men rising from the table near the door -- Robert Rubin, recently resigned as the secretary of the Treasury, and Richard Holbrooke, newly confirmed as the ambassador to the United Nations -- gather their papers and close their briefcases. They nod to people in remote corners of the room, and as they walk out into the lobby, the matre d'htel bows to them with a grateful smile, acknowledging their fitness to be seen in the company of horses by Fores, watches from Breguet, the lily by Redoute. Frank McCourt 345 East 15th Street Frank McCourt is the author, most recently, of '''Tis.'' It is the first day of the academic year for the High School for Health Professions and Human Services. This is where I used to teach, from 1969 to 1987, back when Stuyvesant High School was in this building. Students crowd the sidewalks between First and Second Avenues. They sit on the steps of the old brownstones opposite their school. They also lean against cars, triggering alarms, which they then imitate. They laugh till security guards or other adults from the school ask them to please stay off the cars. The students are polite, but when the adults go back into the building, they relax against the cars again. Along the street, there are reunions, cries and hugs. Hi, Joey. Hi, Miranda. Wow, you lost weight. Love your hair. The student population seems to be largely African-American, with smaller groups of Hispanics and Asians and an even smaller group of whites. When I taught here, the population was mostly Jewish, though as the years went on it became increasingly Asian. The school bell rings, and the boxes, bags and bottles containing foods and drinks must be disposed of. Adults from the school ask the students to please pick up their garbage and put it in the can, but there is litter and the school year has begun. Zero births and deaths reported in New York City. 7,420,166 estimated population. S - Bastienne Schmidt New Brighton, Staten Island It's breakfast time for Philippe Cheng and his 6-month-old son, Max. M - Garry Trudeau Fifth Avenue and 84th Street The Alignment of The Heavens www.astrology.net B - Deborah Mesa-Pelly Remsen Street, Brooklyn Heights B - Phillip Lopate Carroll Park, Brooklyn Phillip Lopate is the editor of ''The Art of the Essay,'' an annual anthology. Four hefty Italian-American moms sit around the picnic benches, drinking iced espressos while their kids dash around. A father, middle-aged like me (Oh, the sticky solicitous doting of graybeard dads!), tenderly picks up his boy to take him to the bathroom in the dignified stone park house. Another father lifts his tan-frocked daughter up to grab the parallel bars, then says, ''Play with something else,'' and heads for a bench. He's teaching her ''independence,'' meanwhile grabbing a few private moments. She skulks over the standard-issue climbing structure, probably thinking, Why do adults insist on pretending it's fun to play by yourself? This park is the glue that holds our (suddenly trendy) neighborhood together, the one public space that equalizes newcomers and old-timers, haves and have-nots. In their corner, black nannies with white babies discuss in island accents the chances of finding other employment. Across, a woman trains her son to take toddler steps, while absent-mindedly picking lint from her yellow blouse. A huge-bellied man snoozes on a bench, his shopping cart filled with collected bottles. Excerpts from the Dow Jones news ticker, Times Square: TOKYO STOCKS CLOSE 0.2% HIGHER AFTER JAPAN'S G.D.P.

Homes Crunch gym, 404 Lafayette Street A.M. Homes is the author of ''Music for Torching,''a novel. In front of me are hindquarters -- three women on StairMasters, pushing to the top. To my left, a famous foreign correspondent, on a Precor EFX544 Crosstrainer. He reads papers damp with sweat, turning the pages and then shedding them to the floor, leaving a pile of news all around him. On the treadmill next to me, a gray-haired guy, cell phone clipped to his shorts. He runs at 5.8 m.p.h., panting. His phone rings. ''I don't know,'' he barks. ''I don't know anything.'' At the juice bar, someone orders a Chocolate Monkey with soy protein. Overhead hangs a bank of TV's, close-captioned for the hearing impaired. On the exercise channel, a group of 20 does tricep exercises in unison. The CNBC ticker tape flows while Martha Stewart's mother suggests adding pineapple to the rice pudding; Martha, justifiably suspicious, offers that maybe raisins would be more traditional. A commercial for Final Fantasy IV flashes across the screen, and the gray-haired guy is ringing again. ''Are we winning?'' he asks, splashing sweat onto my controls. ''That's all I want to know, are we winning?'' M - Darcy Frey WEST 72nd Street Darcy Frey is the author of ''The Last Shot.'' Location: Small, well-appointed office, decorated with sprawling vines and South American artifacts, in an apartment building. Two men face each other in leather armchairs. On an ottoman between them sits a tape recorder. Patient: Last night, I had all sorts of performance-anxiety dreams. Analyst: Such as? Patient: Well, I dreamt I was in some sort of stage production and I couldn't remember any of my lines. Analyst: Yes? Patient: And the woman I was doing the scene with, she couldn't remember any of her lines, either. [Through the open window comes the squeal of truck brakes.] To be honest, I think it's about my doubts and anxieties about being in therapy. Analyst: Let's stay with the dream for a moment. Where does the dream take place? Patient: I can't remember. Analyst: And the woman -- who was she? [The piercing cry of a car alarm is heard.] Patient: I can't remember. Analyst: Well, what did she look like? Patient: I can't remember. Analyst: Well, was she someone you were romantically involved with? [A jackhammer starts up. Analyst and patient raise their voices.] Patient: No, she was someone I'd been paired with artificially. Analyst: And why do you think this is about therapy? Patient: Well, talk about an artificial situation! M - Michael Pollan Central Park Michael Pollan is a contributing writer for the magazine. ''It's hideous out there,'' warned the radio. ''Hazy, hot and humid'' was the forecast, and by 9:09 it was already all of that. But hideous? Not where I was. Where I was was on the terrace of Belvedere Castle, the rough midpoint and actual high point of Central Park, and the precise spot where New York City's weather is measured by an ensemble of meteorological instruments. At 9:09, the official readings were as follows: temperature, 24 C; dew point, 22 C; relative humidity, 87 percent; visibility, 1 1/2 miles in mist; barometric pressure, 29.87. Here are some other, unofficial readings as of 9:09, collected by five different instruments temporarily installed at the same location: Eyes: Looking north over the Great Lawn, a milky haze hangs in the trees, throwing the blocky crenelations edging the park slightly out of focus. The effect is like standing at the bottom of a large white teacup, the haze curving up the sides to an indistinct rim circling above; only directly overhead is the pale blue of the sky visible. Below, five mallards moving east etch overlapping V's in the green pane of Turtle Pond. Eight turtles nap on a narrow ledge of schist, all presenting themselves to the sun at precisely the same angle. Across the pond, six stagehands are striking the set at the Delacorte Theater. A woman in a Sullivan & Cromwell T-shirt Rollerblades along the perimeter of the Great Lawn, which is being mowed. A belated wisteria bloom, one of summer's (and millennium's) last, hangs in the crown of a cherry tree. Skin: Right cheek registers an intense circle of radiant heat originating at the 2 o'clock position in the eastern sky. Tongue: Tang of salt, from the perspiration beading upper lip. Ears: The drone of traffic across the 79th Street transverse, steady as an air-conditioner until broken by the diesel laboring of a crosstown bus. A jet rising from La Guardia slowly churns the air, then fades, opening a parenthesis for the warble of a bird. Echo-y hammer taps rise from the stagehands, who have switched on a boom box or radio: jazz. Nose: The moist, unmoving air holds each smell in a kind of suspension. There is cut grass; there is decadent pond; there is dumpster; there is hot-dog steam. M - Jhumpa Lahiri Cooper Station Post Office, Fourth Avenue and 11th Street Jhumpa Lahiri is the author of ''Interpreter of Maladies,'' a collection of short stories. A man affixes 33-cent stamps to a pile of purple envelopes. The envelopes are stiff, full of promise, elegantly addressed in bold black strokes. The stamps, self-adhesive, have pink roses on them. The man wears a plaid shirt, khaki shorts, brown shoes and black socks pulled up to his calves. He stands at a table, covered with pale green glass, supported by golden columns. A brass plate runs down the center of the table, with empty round receptacles where there once may have been sponges for moistening stamps. Voices echo in the post office. Heels clip across the floor. The man works solemnly, methodically, about to see a long project to its end. Above his head, a digital clock.Time is running out to the year 2000,'' the clock's backing says: 113 days, 14 hours, 50 minutes, a few seconds to go.

Handmade you can tell the difference: some are rounder; some are fatter; some have a little more filling. Anything done by machine has no feeling. Public Radio's Sound Portraits Productions (David Isay, Stacy Abramson and Meagan Howell) sent reporters out to record the minute in eight places around the city. Here are excerpts; more recordings can be heard at www.nytimes.com/nyminute. M - Richard Sandler Jones Diner, 371 Lafayette Street The Rev. Billy, left, sidewalk preacher: A thousand years from now we will not be measuring our lives by our time-distance from the birth of one Jesus Christ. We will be measuring our time from the birth of Mr. Mickey Mouse. Mickey is the most famous corporate logo in the world, and his power over us is accelerating at the present time. We must resist this. How do we do that? Right now we don't have a clear strategy. Right now, Mickey Mouse and his handlers are in the ascendancy. . . . I have a vision . . . of erasing Mickey Mouse's face. Nothing is left of it. Times Square again becomes a place where the sidewalks are populated by real people! Visionaries. Sex workers. Blarney Stone experiencers. People sagging in the doorways. Hallelujah. That's the future! Amen! Praise be! I'm going to get back to my Western omelet right now. Nice to talk to you. M - Beth Fertig Manhattan Criminal Court Mr. Black [he wouldn't give full name]: Nineteen-ninety-nine is the beginning of the end. Everything is getting worse.

M - Verlyn Klinkenborg 38th Street and Sixth Avenue Verlyn Klinkenborg writes editorials for The Times. He is the author of ''Making Hay'' and ''The Last Fine Time.'' What does this lot lack that makes it ''vacant''? Tenants larger than the 13 pigeons resting there. Foliage more ornamental than the low weeds growing in a solid mat near the 38th Street sidewalk. Dwellings more substantial than the construction trailer parked beside a sign announcing ''Another Gotham Construction Project.'' Commerce more consequential than the sticker pasted to a fence post advertising a Millennium Marijuana March in May 2000. Will the march take place? Will construction begin? Will the pigeons fly? Nothing happens here except time and the roosting of pigeons. And yet the sound of the street -- an overcast roar -- is subtly changed by the cubic absence, the nearly inaudible silence this vacant lot offers the city."

As chairman of the F.C.C. from 1994 to 1997, Mr. Hundt was hardly a champion of the long-distance aspirations of the Baby Bells.

The 1996 Telecommunications Act requires that for Bell Atlantic to gain permission to go after the long-distance customers of AT&T and other competitors, it must first open up its own network of wires and switches so that these competitors get a fair shot at wooing Bell Atlantic's customers for local service. Bell Atlantic comes close, but does not pass some key tests. The commission could have held up approval for a couple of months until Bell Atlantic showed it was fully ready. But having already turned aside several previous applications from Bell companies, it responded to pressure to prove the '96 act was creating competition by finally approving one. The danger with compromised standards is that Bell Atlantic could wield its power to wall off its local market even as it moves to crush competitors in long-distance and Internet services."

Electro-acoustic improv, as some of it is called, involves one musician playing a noncomputerized instrument (guitar, saxophone, drums, whatever) improvising alongside another ''playing'' a computer or a sampler. There's also plain old electronic improvisation, with a similar search for personal, abstract improvisatory languages. It's not entirely new: electronics and jazz-based improvisers like Steve Lacy were ad-libbing together on stage in the early 1970's projects of Musica Electronica Viva; in the English group AMM, founded in 1965, the guitarist Keith Rowe folded short-wave radio sound into his improvisations. And Iannis Xenakis used acoustic sounds in his composed tape manipulations."

June is almost upon us, and as usual, jazz clubs, independent concert producers and the big jazz festivals -- there are now three -- are wrangling for the attention of New Yorkers. This means an astonishing bounty for anyone interested in jazz (with Latin music, gospel and soul as connected satellite genres, in the tradition of the big festivals). There's no choice but to see it as one big unofficial citywide festival, the best and most complete in the world. The Vision Festival, now in its fifth year, has been an unexpected success, marshaling various strands of jazz bohemianism into an 11-day series with the air of a community effort much more than of a business venture. The Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, presided over by Michael Dorf, was once a midget slinging pebbles from the cultural margins, but it has become the great enveloper, taking up much of the burden of presenting jazz from all subgenres and ingeniously marketing it on the Internet and its Knitting Factory record label. This year's edition features more outdoor events, many of them gigantic bills and some of them free. (This is a positive development: it will help New Yorkers return to the notion of festivals as something fun that spills all over a public space, rather than self-contained, wallet-chewing affairs.)"

But buried among the regulatory rulings is something that should prove even more important to most customers in the long run. The commission wrung subsidies out of regulated rates that have kept prices too high and have stymied the outbreak of competition that Congress promised when it passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The issue the commission partially resolved yesterday concerns access charges -- regulated fees that local phone companies like Bell Atlantic are permitted to charge long-distance carriers like AT&T for their use of the wire loops that Bell Atlantic runs into nearly everyone's home and business. The regional Bells and long-distance carriers have been fighting over access since the 1980's."

After the spectacular production problems of the Ornette Coleman concert last week -- ending in generator noises, searing lights on the crowd and an aborted show for a pneumatic ticket price -- the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival appeased its audience on Sunday night. It presented an outdoor concert on the beautifully symmetrical, acoustically reasonable south lawn of the Columbia University campus, headlined by Max Roach and Cecil Taylor, that went a long way toward redefining what such events can achieve. At 76 and 71, Mr. Roach and Mr. Taylor oversee their own batteries of phrases, identification marks that run through 50 years of their working lives. They are phrases with flavor, short reports alternating emphatic strong and weak beats. It was the rhythmic parallels of those phrases that brought Mr. Roach and Mr. Taylor together again so effectively in a duet. (They played together at Columbia in 1979 and at Town Hall in 1989.)"

They have to be: stage and screen musicals in those days led you firmly through their own paces; inasmuch as they were ambiguous, emotionally or musically, they failed. It takes greater effort to feel the full impact of these songs today. What Mr. Haden is able to bring to them is similar to what jazz singers like Shirley Horn and Jimmy Scott bring to their own repertory: a deliberating sensibility that slows down the songs and punctures their outdated confidence, catching them off guard. Performing on Friday night during the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival at the Angel Orensanz Foundation, with a 15-piece chamber orchestra from the Manhattan School of Music and his own group, Quartet West, Mr. Haden himself broke through the surface a few times. The singer Bill Henderson did, too. And Mr. Haden's overall arrangements broke through even more often."

Melody, according to Bill Laswell, Alan Douglas and Karl Berger. Stripping away opera's familiar shape, these three genre-whacking veterans created Operazone. Neither Mr. Douglas nor Mr. Laswell, who conceived of and originally produced Operazone, were visibly present on Monday at the Angel Orensanz Foundation during the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, where Mr. Berger led a diverse ensemble through this project's reworkings. The evening unfolded differently, too, from the Operazone album, a recent Knitting Factory Records release.

Mr. Osby, the alto saxophonist, has been touring with Vashon Johnson and Derek Philips on bass and drums -- it's the fifth rhythm section New York audiences have seen in his band in four years -- and after about a dozen performances across the country they've achieved a particular rhythmic feel that seems to suit him. There's always a steady underlying pulse; Mr. Osby takes his tempos seriously. But the rhythm's emphases are jagged, and bass and drums keep up a flow of rhythmic ornamentation. This band leader likes to keep things bubbling and interactive; soloists in his music are given their moments of prominence, but they're navigating choppy currents so that a listener is forced to listen to the whole group instead of just the main improviser. In performance, Mr. Osby flows pieces together, sometimes staying with a tune only briefly. And for the last five years or so, his vision has been so commanding that no matter who's holding down the rhythm, he has had one of the freshest, most exciting groups in jazz."

It's hard to picture the band, now down to a woodwinds-bass-drums trio, without Bowie's comic presence, which always balanced out the saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell's formalism. But the band's deep following among the kind of audience that built the Knitting Factory ought to ensure that the evening will at the very least have a poignancy.

It's interesting to see a mainstream jazz group yield so much to the power of the rhythm section: for stretches in almost every piece, the three-part horn section -- when its players weren't playing their harmonized arrangements or their solos -- simply stood at the back of the stage and played percussion instruments, adding fuel to the sparks created by the bassist Avishai Cohen and the drummer Jeff Ballard. And sometimes even Mr. Corea, one of the great piano soloists in jazz, did that, too. His latest band, Origin, is filled with some of the best younger musicians in New York who haven't yet become stars. Its recordings -- a six-disc set of live shows from 1998 and a recent single CD called ''Change'' -- have appeared on Mr. Corea's own label, Stretch (an imprint of Concord).

Kennard can't explain to his wife the complexities of their phone bill, it's time for the telephone companies to make their bills simpler. Kennard is the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. And that's why he was the one to announce recently that the government and the nation's leading telecoms have agreed both to simplify their bills by clarifying hidden subsidies and to pass on to consumers the savings from reduced access charges that long-distance companies pay to the regional bells. One reason phone bills have been -- and despite all intentions, are likely to remain -- dauntingly complex is because telephone companies have in effect become great tax collectors, raising money for everything from the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York to Internet service in inner-city schools. Other complicating factors include the variety of cross-payments between companies for access to equipment and facilities as well as for subsidies to finance service for the disadvantaged and others.

Although about one-third of the union locals had still not signed off on the settlement last evening, the company and the union leaders said the 15-day strike was effectively over. They said union workers in the region affected by the strike -- 12 states from Maine to Virginia and the District of Columbia -- could return to their jobs in New York and New England as soon as this morning, although workers in states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania are still waiting for their local presidents to approve the contract."

What is more, the unions' agreement with Verizon Communications, the nation's largest telecommunications employer, with 260,000 employees around the nation, touches many of the hot-button issues of the new economy -- including stock options, profit-sharing and the relentlessness of long workdays."

Negotiators for Verizon employees in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Washington discussed details like limits on mandatory overtime and the definition of certain jobs with officials of the company, which was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation."

567,2000/09/10,The Maximum Security Adolescent,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/10/magazine/the-maximum-security-adolescent.html,"When Jefferson Alexander Stackhouse was 3 years old, good luck entered his life for the first and maybe the last time. Abandoned as a 2-week-old infant by a schizophrenic mother, Jeff had lived by then in eight different foster homes. But in 1988, he was taken in by a woman who quickly made up her mind to love him and who adopted him two years later. The fact that Jeff came to her ''with all his worldly possessions in one very small box'' and called every adult female Mommy ''not only broke but stole my heart,'' his adoptive mother, Leslie Stackhouse, says now. Leslie and her then husband, Norman, adopted two more ''special needs'' children, a girl named Christin and her brother, Casey, who had been taken away from abusive parents when they were toddlers. Leslie's training as a foster parent helped her to go slowly with all three, giving them time to trust her. Though Jeff was withdrawn at first, prone to banging his head against the wall and biting himself, he grew into a happy little boy with a powerful loyalty to his mother. By the time he hit 14, though, Jeff was getting into the kind of scrapes that keep a mother up at night. Joe Wilson, a family friend who ran a driving school in town, thought Jeff was a good kid who was being picked on because he was small for his age. ''I think he was trying to defend himself in a pretty tough neighborhood,'' Wilson says. Jeff and his friends in Glendale, a working-class Phoenix suburb of low-slung houses, wide boulevards and scruffy palm trees, sneaked out one hot summer evening after curfew to search for loose change in unlocked cars. Jeff was caught and went through counseling in a juvenile crime deterrence program. A couple of months later, he and another friend stole a bike, which Jeff rode to school and returned later that day."

In a sharp reversal, the Standard & Poor's 500 communications services index, which rose 18.2 percent last year, has dropped 28.9 percent from a mid-December high, to 173.55. Telephone stocks climbed last year, and a bit this spring, on excitement about mergers and the entry of local carriers into long-distance service. But Wall Street has done an about-face on the sector, focusing on the dilution caused by acquisitions, on higher-than-expected capital needs and on fear that competition will put pressure on profits."

Spending was estimated at $20 million to $30 million. John Bonomo, a spokesman at Verizon Communications in New York, said the decision came after a three-month informal consideration of Burrell and four other Verizon roster agencies: Arnold Communications in Boston, part of Snyder Communications, which is being acquired by Havas Advertising; the Lord Group in New York, a joint venture of Dentsu Inc. and Young & Rubicam Inc., which agreed to be acquired by the WPP Group; the Dallas office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of WPP; and Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., part of True North Communications."

He will, of course, be remembered most for taking on Microsoft. But beyond that celebrated case, Mr. Klein brought new energy and credibility to a division whose enforcement arm had lain dormant since the Reagan administration. Mr. Klein's tenure did not start well. As acting head of the antitrust division, he approved unconditionally the merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, eliminating the benefits that would come from future competition between these regional phone giants. But Mr. Klein made sound judgments in subsequent cases, showing that mainstream antitrust principles can be effectively applied to modern markets."
