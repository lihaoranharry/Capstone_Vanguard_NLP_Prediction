Disney's financial results, reported on Tuesday afternoon, also carried an optimistic message about consumer confidence from its sprawling theme park operation - a sharp contrast to last week's downbeat job growth and retail sales reports.

The Talking Heads once sang that heaven is a place where nothing ever happens. Heaven, then, is a Browns game, a nonevent between moribund teams with few recognizable stars that ends in a 6-3, 13-12, or 14-10 final score. When not losing convincingly to good teams, the Browns challenge the devotion and attention span of fans everywhere by wasting whole afternoons in slow-motion tugs of war against fellow thrill ascetics. It takes real work to comb through the game tape and play-by-play of an entire Browns-Jaguars game, only to discover that the only quasi-interesting story lines are questions about whether a 38-yard field goal sailed just inside the right upright (it didn't) or if Jack Del Rio could explain the final Jaguars play call that gave the Browns a victory (he couldn't). Bengals games, by contrast, are full of action. The Bengals catch bombs and allow bombs. Andy Dalton completes incredible passes and attempts ill-conceived option pitches on the same drive. Defenders tackle receivers by pulling their hair. Pacman Jones has been on the roster for weeks and has done nothing loopy yet, which means that he is due. The Bengals are just good enough to lose to the Ravens and the Steelers, but they are a cut above the teams that get trapped in the Browns' tar pits. The Bengals' 27-17 victory at Cleveland in Week 1 will repeat itself, if only because the Browns are too boring to try something new. Pick: Bengals.",

Mr. Kenny will start immediately. Michael J. Kelly, who had been the chief executive since 2009, will become a special adviser to the company and an adviser to Bain Capital, the private equity firm that co-owns the company with the Blackstone Group and Comcast's NBCUniversal. The surprise change signaled a desire on the part of the co-owners to expand the Weather Channel's digital and mobile businesses more quickly. Through mobile apps and Web sites like Weather.com, the company sees an opportunity to have a much bigger international footprint. ''Six and a half billion people need information about weather,'' Mr. Kenny said in an interview Tuesday after addressing the company's staff in Atlanta. Mr. Kenny also said that the company would make more investments in long-form programming - part of a gradual move away from live weather news and toward taped weather-related reality shows. ''Now that people can get the information they need for their forecast off the Web, and certainly on their mobile phone, that gives us more license to do more long-form on the cable channel,'' he said. The channel remained committed to live news during severe weather, he added. Mr. Kenny, a member of the board of directors of Yahoo, was the president of Akamai until he stepped down last October. He was previously the co-founder of VivaKi, a digital agency that is part of the Publicis Groupe. In a statement, the three co-owners of the Weather Channel said that Mr. Kenny's experience ''gives him a deep understanding of the TV and digital business, and he has the leadership experience and vision to drive global initiatives across all platforms.'' Mr. Kelly, similarly, had a digital media background when he was hired two and a half years ago. Mr. Kenny said he was initially recruited to join the board of the company, and was later asked by the board to consider the chief executive position. ''What I've long stood for is convergence,'' he said. ''I think you'll see us find better ways to run the Weather Channel as one company, really organized around our hundreds of millions of users.'' NBCUniversal and the private equity firms have owned the Weather Channel since 2008. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",

Michael J. Kelly, who had been the chief executive since 2009, will become a special adviser to the company and an adviser to Bain Capital, the private equity firm that co-owns the company with the Blackstone Group and Comcast's NBCUniversal.The surprise change signaled a desire on the part of the co-owners to expand the Weather Channel's digital and mobile businesses more quickly. Through mobile apps and Web sites like Weather.com, the company sees an opportunity to have a much bigger international footprint.""Six and a half billion people need information about weather,"" Mr. Kenny said in an interview Tuesday after addressing the company's staff in Atlanta.Mr. Kenny also said that the company would make more investments in long-form programming - part of a gradual move away from live weather news and toward taped weather-related reality shows.""Now that people can get the information they need for their forecast off the Web, and certainly on their mobile phone, that gives us more license to do more long-form on the cable channel,"" he said. The channel remained committed to live news during severe weather, he added.Mr. Kenny, a member of the board of directors of Yahoo, was the president of Akamai until he stepped down last October. He was previously the co-founder of VivaKi, a digital agency that is part of the Publicis Groupe.In a statement, the three co-owners of the Weather Channel said that Mr. Kenny's experience ""gives him a deep understanding of the TV and digital business, and he has the leadership experience and vision to drive global initiatives across all platforms.""Mr. Kelly, similarly, had a digital media background when he was hired two and a half years ago.Mr. Kenny said he was initially recruited to join the board of the company, and was later asked by the board to consider the chief executive position.""What I've long stood for is convergence,"" he said.
