Known as the King of Currumpaw, Lobo had a mythical ability to cheat death, and after eventually trapping Lobo, Seton found he couldn't kill him. Lobo ultimately died from his injuries, and Seton returned east, recording his findings in the book ''Wild Animals I Have Known'' and using his popularity to push for the creation of national parks and lay the groundwork for the Boy Scouts of America. ''Ever since Lobo,'' Seton said, ''my sincerest wish has been to impress upon people that each of our native wild creatures is in itself a precious heritage that we have no right to destroy or put beyond the reach of our children.'' 10 A.M.

Shortly after the Mitchell report was released in December 2007, Clemens was interviewed by Mike Wallace on CBS's ''60 Minutes.'' In that interview Clemens adamantly denied the assertions in the report by his former trainer Brian McNamee that Clemens had used steroids on numerous occasions from 1998 to 2001. In February 2008, Clemens and McNamee testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and, after Clemens's testimony contradicted that of McNamee, the committee asked the Justice Department to investigate Clemens for perjury. Since then, Clemens has said little publicly."

The current count is 189.5 superdelegate votes for Mrs. Clinton and 142.5 for Mr. Obama. But in a similar survey conducted last month, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Obama by 204 to 99. About 8 percent of the total 795 superdelegates changed their minds over the last few weeks, as many states held their primaries and caucuses. Few delegates switched allegiance from one candidate to the other; the main changes were among the undecided delegates. Among the previously undecided delegates who now are endorsing a candidate, Mr. Obama got more of their support. Some of Mrs. Clinton's previous supporters are now undecided."

We've taken a broad view: any nonfiction (and nonnews, nonsports or nontalk) show that's roughly in prime time (sorry, ''Flip This House''); is on one of the six major English-language broadcast networks or one of the Top 25 nonnews cable channels, as they were ranked by Nielsen at the beginning of the year (sorry, Animal Planet, CMT, National Geographic, Oxygen, Travel and WE, among others); and is presenting new episodes between now and the end of the year (sorry, ''Deadliest Catch'' and ''American Idol'').

According to Nielsen's overnight estimates, the 23-minute college basketball overrun into the 7 p.m. time slot meant that more than 17 million viewers were tuned in to CBS during the first half-hour of prime time. Directly after the live coverage ended, CBS drew about 12.3 million viewers for ''60 Minutes,'' followed by an above-average audience of 8 million viewers for CBS's ''Big Brother.'' Despite its second place finish, ABC outpaced CBS among adults 18 to 49 thanks to ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' at 8 (12.8 million) and ''Oprah's Big Give'' at 9 (11.3 million). Fox was third for the night in that demographic, trailing both ABC and CBS with its animated comedy lineup. NBC, which drew slightly more total viewers than Fox, finished a distant fourth in the 18-to-49 set. NBC broadcast repeats from 9 to 11, following a special showing of MSNBC's ''Countdown With Keith Olbermann'' at 7 (3.4 million) and ''Dateline'' at 8 (6.7 million)."

On Friday, Donald Knutson, son of Charlotte and Henry Knutson, died at his home in Park Slope twenty-five months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. At M.I.T., Dr. Knutson earned his bachelor's degree, his doctorate and his wife, Andrea Allen Knutson. Don's 1968 doctoral thesis, ""Algebraic Spaces"", is still widely read today by those pursuing algebraic stacks. Don taught at Boston College, Columbia, where he guided doctoral students, and Fordham. In 1978, after receiving an M.B.A. from Columbia, Don started a 29-year career as a financial executive at CBS Television Network. Early in his career he was asked to determine what CBS should bid for the Olympics and NFL contracts. For the latter, Don's first step was to ask what the letters NFL meant. Later he developed many of the analytical systems that are in use at CBS today, and which he was still improving up until the day before he was diagnosed with a tumor in the center of his brain. After his surgery he attacked his neurological problems with a no-fuss cheerful curiosity. He relearned the alphabet using his grandson's puzzles, rejoined the Brooklyn Conservatory Chorale, attempted to dine in every Park Slope restaurant, and hiked the hills of Prospect Park, the Berkshires and the Swiss Alps. Even after last winter when a second tumor paralyzed his right side, he regarded dressing himself one-handed as an interesting project and continued to attend at least two plays or concerts weekly. The only challenge that he found heartbreaking was the decline in his ability to play the piano. Don is survived by his wife Andrea, his children Allen and Miranda, his grandchildren Fionn and Taran, his brother Robert, his five cats and his 5,000-book library. The wake will be held at the family home, 618 6th St., Brooklyn on Tuesday, 3-9pm. Contact: mknutsonw@gmail.com. A memorial concert at the Brooklyn-Queens Conservatory of Music is planned for the fall. Donations may be made in Don's memory to the Brooklyn-Queens Conservatory: bqcm.org/support.htm."

Her appearance as a hard-drinking, ethics-schmethics defense lawyer on the short-lived Fox drama ''Canterbury's Law'' only made the heart grow annoyed. But Ms. Margulies's hardened vulnerability leaves her perfectly suited to the title role on ''The Good Wife,'' a CBS series that seeks to capture the essence of the age as a net might trap a butterfly. Standing beside her philandering political husband at his penance-seeking news conference, Ms. Margulies deftly balances loss and disgust with a determination to reclaim an identity long ago submerged.

On Friday, Donald Knutson, son of Charlotte and Henry Knutson, died at his home in Park Slope twenty-five months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. At M.I.T., Dr. Knutson earned his bachelor's degree, his doctorate and his wife, Andrea Allen Knutson. Don's 1968 doctoral thesis, ""Algebraic Spaces"", is still widely read today by those pursuing algebraic stacks. Don taught at Boston College, Columbia, where he guided doctoral students, and Fordham. In 1978, after receiving an M.B.A. from Columbia, Don started a 29-year career as a financial executive at CBS Television Network. Early in his career he was asked to determine what CBS should bid for the Olympics and NFL contracts. For the latter, Don's first step was to ask what the letters NFL meant. Later he developed many of the analytical systems that are in use at CBS today, and which he was still improving up until the day before he was diagnosed with a tumor in the center of his brain. After his surgery he attacked his neurological problems with a no-fuss cheerful curiosity. He relearned the alphabet using his grandson's puzzles, rejoined the Brooklyn Conservatory Chorale, attempted to dine in every Park Slope restaurant, and hiked the hills of Prospect Park, the Berkshires and the Swiss Alps. Even after last winter when a second tumor paralyzed his right side, he regarded dressing himself one-handed as an interesting project and continued to attend at least two plays or concerts weekly. The only challenge that he found heartbreaking was the decline in his ability to play the piano. Don is survived by his wife Andrea, his children Allen and Miranda, his grandchildren Fionn and Taran, his brother Robert, his five cats and his 5,000-book library. The wake will be held at the family home, 618 6th St., Brooklyn on Tuesday, 3-9pm. Contact: mknutsonw@gmail.com. A memorial concert at the Brooklyn-Queens Conservatory of Music is planned for the fall.

As expected, Fox said it had signed a multiyear deal with Don Imus, right, the host who was fired by CBS Radio and MSNBC two years ago after making racial remarks about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. His program was revived by the radio company Citadel and the rural television network RFD-TV, but Mr. Imus ended the television deal last month. The simulcast, to be shown from 6 to 9 a.m. Eastern time, is expected to buoy the low-rated Fox Business Network, which began in October 2007. Mr. Imus doesn't make financial news a regular part of his talk show, but Fox said the program ''will incorporate additional business news into its format.'' Notably, three of the anchors partially displaced by Mr. Imus's hiring will host a three-hour morning-news program on the network's Web site, FoxBusiness.com, from 6 to 9. The anchors of the Web show, Jenna Lee, Connell McShane and Ashley Webster, will also appear regularly on ''Imus in the Morning,'' Fox said. Alexis Glick, a vice president at Fox Business who now leads the network's 7 to 10 a.m. hours, will remain the host of the 9 a.m. hour. In a statement, Mr. Imus said: ''I love Fox. Roger Ailes is the pre-eminent genius of American broadcasting. Who wouldn't want to do this?''"

1837,,Cable Guise,http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E4DB1738F935A35751C1A96F9C8B63,"After Walter Cronkite died earlier this year, Frank Mankiewicz, the onetime Democratic operative, recalled in The Washington Post how he had proposed that George McGovern select the CBS anchorman as his running mate during the 1972 presidential campaign. Cronkite was, of course, one of the most admired men in America and a known skeptic of the war in Vietnam. And yet McGovern's others advisers unanimously rejected the Cronkite gamble, not just because they feared he would say no but also because the boundary between journalism and elective office was so absolute that the thought of merging them struck aides as too desperate a ploy. Cronkite was ''wholly outside of politics,'' as Mankiewicz described it. Voters and party leaders, it was thought, could no more accept a newsman as a Democratic spokesman than they could imagine a politician broadcasting the evening news. Now it seems that Cronkite's brief moment as a vice-presidential contender may have been the first inevitable step down a treacherous path. Today we're not at all surprised to hear names like Chris Matthews and Lou Dobbs tossed around as candidates for higher office. And while it used to be that only political aides of notable talent, people like Bill Moyers and Pat Buchanan and George Stephanopoulos (and, well, Chris Matthews), could make the tricky transition from politics to TV news, now it's the politicians themselves -- Joe Scarborough, Mike Huckabee -- who find themselves ensconced as hosts on a cable-TV set. The door between politics and television news now isn't merely revolving; it spins so fast and so continuously that a fair number of people no longer seem to belong neatly on one side or the other. Is Sarah Palin, at this point, a politician, or is she the star of some ''frontier family'' reality show? In fact, she seems to realize that the changed environment allows her to be both at the same time."

He is survived by his wife of 71 years, Evelyn, their children Joshua, Deborah and Rebecca and grandchildren Mathew and Sarah Barnett. His long career in media arts began as an assistant to the legendary manager/producer Leland Heyward. Soon White was representing artists on his own including Walter Huston and Charles Laughton. Eventually he began to produce independently. He had the original idea of producing weekly radio series based on classic detective fiction like that of Dashiell Hammett. His first success was Sam Spade based on the detective in the book and movie, The Maltese Falcon. Sam Spade was quickly followed by a another series called ""The Fat Man"", in which an original detective in the Hammett style was successfully created. Both series ran for many years on CBS Radio. In the early fifties, White moved to the growing medium of television. He was the creator and sole producer of The Pinky Lee Show. At the height of its popularity, The Pinky Lee Show was broadcast six hours a week live on NBC. The legendary studio in Burbank currently occupied by The Tonight Show was built for Pinky. At the same time and in partnership with Leland Heyward he produced the ground breaking Ford 50th Anniversary Show, one of the very first ""specials"", which starred Ethel Merman and Mary Martin and was directed by Jerome Robbins. At the time, the show was so important that two networks, NBC and CBS both carried it live. Later, White was active in bringing Jazz to a huge audience by producing a series of classic Jazz Shows on Television sponsored by Timex watches. He also pioneered using Videotape at classic circuses in Europe, bringing them to America as ""International Showtime,"" a long running series hosted by Don Ameche on NBC. He is remembered for his originality, creativity and intelligence. Final services are incomplete."

The tribute begins with ''Sweet Smell of Success'' (1957), in which a press agent (Tony Curtis) helps a powerful columnist (Lancaster, above left, with Susan Harrison and Mr. Curtis) break up his sister's relationship with a musician. In ''Trapeze'' (1956), at 10, Lancaster and Mr. Curtis play trapeze artists who fall for a trampolinist (Gina Lollobrigida). In ''Elmer Gantry'' (1960), at midnight, Lancaster stars as a ne'er-do-well salesman turned evangelist preacher running from his troubled past; he won a best-actor Oscar for the role. And in ''The Rainmaker'' (1956), at 2:30 a.m., Lancaster plays Bill Starbuck, who tries to coax the rain in a drought-stricken Kansas town. Katharine Hepburn is the spinster whose heart he warms. 11:30 A.M.

He is survived by his wife of 71 years, Evelyn, their children Joshua, Deborah and Rebecca and grandchildren Mathew and Sarah Barnett. His long career in media arts began as an assistant to the legendary manager/producer Leland Heyward. Soon White was representing artists on his own including Walter Huston and Charles Laughton. Eventually he began to produce independently. He had the original idea of producing weekly radio series based on classic detective fiction like that of Dashiell Hammett. His first success was Sam Spade based on the detective in the book and movie, The Maltese Falcon. Sam Spade was quickly followed by a another series called ''The Fat Man'', in which an original detective in the Hammett style was successfully created. Both series ran for many years on CBS Radio. In the early fifties, White moved to the growing medium of television. He was the creator and sole producer of The Pinky Lee Show. At the height of its popularity, The Pinky Lee Show was broadcast six hours a week live on NBC. The legendary studio in Burbank currently occupied by The Tonight Show was built for Pinky. At the same time and in partnership with Leland Heyward he produced the ground breaking Ford 50th Anniversary Show, one of the very first ''specials'', which starred Ethel Merman and Mary Martin and was directed by Jerome Robbins. At the time, the show was so important that two networks, NBC and CBS both carried it live. Later, White was active in bringing Jazz to a huge audience by producing a series of classic Jazz Shows on Television sponsored by Timex watches. He also pioneered using Videotape at classic circuses in Europe, bringing them to America as ''International Showtime,'' a long running series hosted by Don Ameche on NBC. He is remembered for his originality, creativity and intelligence. Final services are incomplete."

On May 4, 1977, more than 45 million Americans tuned in for the first chapter of Mr. Frost's four-part interview, which is rebooted here.

Page A10 THE GERMAN MILK PARTY? The Federation of European Dairy Farmers estimates that, on Wednesday alone, 10.6 million gallons of milk were dumped in a boycott by European dairy farmers. Why? While food prices have soared, the price of milk has not, in part because the European Union has raised quotas but not prices. As the price of milk fell, prices of fuel and feed rose. But cows keep producing and will sicken if not milked, so dairy farmers will keep working, and dumping, as long as the boycott lasts. Page A6 THE LAST DAYS OF NEPAL'S MONARCHY Nepal's 239-year-long monarchy neared its end, as a newly elected assembly told Gyanendra, king of Nepal, to step down from his throne in 15 days. The assembly is led by former Maoist guerrillas who emerged from the jungle after 10 years of war and traded gunplay for politics. They also demanded an end to the monarchy. Winning more than a third of Parliament's 601 seats, they hold a majority position and the party's leader is expected to take over as prime minister. Those suspected of remaining loyal to the monarchy have spoken by detonating small bombs in Katmandu. Page A8 SOUTH AFRICA WEIGHS SHELTER PLAN Waves of xenophobic violence have been visited against immigrants in South Africa, leading them to flee the impoverished squatter areas they had been living in. Relief organizations have proposed shelters intended as a temporary solution that could house as many as 70,000, but have been delayed pending a government decision. Doubts have been raised about South Africa's ability to run them, and international agencies fear that the camps could become rife with conflicts and sexual violence.

''At times, I've really wondered if I could get through.''

PAGE A14 BUSINESS WITH FURTHER MERGERS UNLIKELY, Airlines Face Making Own Cuts Mergers other than the already-announced deal between Delta and Northwest seem unlikely, so airlines seeking to offset rising fuel prices are likely to cut costs, cut routes and park planes without the camouflage that a merger would have provided. And that means that the grumbling will come through unfiltered. PAGE C1 EXXON CHALLENGE DEFEATED Exxon Mobil's chairman and chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, defeated a shareholder effort supported by many members of the Rockefeller family that would have divided the chairman and chief executive positions. The vote was at an annual meeting punctuated by a debate of the company's policy toward renewable energy and global warming and, though nonbinding, would have been a serious rebuke. PAGE C3 NATURAL GAS RISING LIKE GASOLINE A longstanding assumption of American energy policy -- that natural gas will be plentiful abroad, and therefore readily available for importation, as production falls off in North America -- is being challenged as the supertankers that were supposed to deliver cargoes of gas from Africa and the Middle East to the United States are taking them to places like Spain and Japan instead.

Cuomo of New York says giving members of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's board free E-ZPasses to drive across its bridges and tunnels without paying tolls, as well as passes to ride the subways, buses and commuter railroads without paying, violates a state law requiring that members serve without compensation.

PAGE A24 STYLES STILL TURNING A PROFIT In Fashion's Fast Lane One survey this month found more than half the respondents saying they planned to spend less on apparel; another found almost a third of people reporting ''severe anxiety'' about their personal finances. All of which can be good news, it seems, if you happen to be in the fast-fashion business. ''The least vulnerable brands now are the ones at the lower end of the luxury market and the upper end of the midtier market,'' one analyst said. PAGE E1 YOGA FOR THE MASSES The explosion in popularity of yoga has been good news for novices looking for classes -- there is seemingly one on every corner, and maybe another upstairs. But for the advanced student looking for something a little -- or a lot -- more challenging, the result is not so good. In seeking to be accessible to the many, classes become less desirable for the few. PAGE E10 FEEL THE STRETCH, AVOID THE MARK Various concoctions are marketing as being able to prevent stretch marks resulting from pregnancy. Can they? The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says no. But the American Pregnancy Association suggests that women can reduce the probability of stretch marks (the key word being ''probability''). But be aware that genetics and race play a role in stretch marks, too. skin PAGE E3 NO ORDINARY JOE This sort of thing used to be reserved for wines, but beers have gotten into the act, along with single malt scotches. And so it follows that coffee tastings -- known to aficionados as cuppings -- now appear, at which the devoted might pay $20 each to taste three coffees, each from a different country. Take along a sophisticated palate if you want to pick up the hints of basil and jasmine. PAGE E6 SPORTS AT 17, READY TO RUN Against Sport's Elite Chanelle Price is a high school senior with some typical items on her to-do list this time of year: finish writing two papers, take two final exams. She also has one most unusual item: run the 800 meters at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., on June 8. From there, who knows, maybe the Olympics in Beijing. PAGE C12 WHEN IT WENT TO THE WIRE The occasion of this year's run at horse racing's Triple Crown cannot help calling forth memories of the last one, 30 years ago, when two outstanding horses not only faced off in each of the three races but also finished 1-2 in each of them. ''Seen through the current prism of fragile, transient champions, Affirmed and Alydar seem from another planet, another age, another breed,'' George Vecsey writes in Sports of The Times. PAGE C14 HOME FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE To That Chlorine Smell For those who want -- or have -- a swimming pool, but do not want the smell and possible other side effects of a chlorine sanitation system, other options exist. Pool installers may not tell you about them, and they are not cheap, but for some people they are a must. ''Our target audience is the person who shops at Whole Foods,'' said one installer. PAGE F1 PUTTING DOWN (SHALLOW) ROOTS Move often enough, Peter Moore says, and ''you realize quickly how you are burdened by your past, and so you become a ruthless editor.'' And Mr. Moore, an architect and developer, and his wife, Kathryn Lynch, a painter, have moved often enough. But they've been in the same place for three years now: the top floor of an 1890s brick warehouse on Washington Street. ''Our semipermanent home,'' he calls it.

PAGE C11 ARTS ABC IN ANCHOR TALKS With Charles Gibson ABC passed over Charles Gibson in 2005 as anchor of ''World News,'' but events put him in the job anyway, success followed, and now he is in talks to stay there for the foreseeable future. Does he want to? ''I honestly don't know,'' he says. One person who must be anxiously waiting the outcome is Diane Sawyer, whose future probably is linked to the result. PAGE B1 AN ETHICS DISCLAIMER The media reporter (and sometimes ethics arbiter) Howard Kurtz invited Kimberly Dozier, the CBS journalist wounded in Iraq, onto his program on CNN on Sunday to talk about her memoir, ''Breathing the Fire.'' After the interview, he revealed that his wife had ''done some promotion work'' for the book. He and his employers see no problem with that. Some media ethicists do. PAGE B3 'LOST' LEADING THE LOST Even committed viewers of the ABC series ''Lost'' might be forgiven for not being able to follow every twist of its anarchic plot or not being aware of the relevance -- even the existence -- of the many obscure allusions made. And anyone who has looked even briefly at ''Lost'' blogs knows that some people are trying way too hard. Season Four concludes tonight. PAGE B1 Gliding Through Space B5 EDITORIAL IN DEFENSE OF WORKERS The Supreme Court upheld the rights of employees who charge age and race discrimination. Perhaps the justices realized that Americans want a court that does not stack the deck for the powerful. Or, they may simply be getting better at respecting precedent.

It was just for one show, Monday night, and Mr. Letterman’s lead was not sizable, but Mr. Leno had won the first three nights. Their competition resumed last Wednesday, when most of the late-night hosts came back after supporting the writers’ strike for two months. Mr. Leno is working without his writing staff, which is still on strike against his “Tonight Show” on NBC, while Mr. Letterman, above, was able to return with writers to his CBS show because of a separate deal his production company made with the Writers Guild of America. Mr. Letterman has also been able to book the normal roster of movie-star guests; on Monday night he had Tom Hanks, while Mr. Leno had the upstart Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. In the overnight ratings, measuring the country’s 65 largest cities, Mr. Letterman had a 4 rating on Monday to Mr. Leno’s 3.8. (Each point is worth 787,659 households.) But in their shows’ first half-hour, when Mr. Leno is performing a monologue over the opposition of the writers’ guild, he still beat Mr. Letterman, with a 4.5 rating to a 4.3. CBS’s thin victory margin continued on the 12:35 a.m. shows, where Craig Ferguson enjoyed a rare ratings victory over NBC’s Conan O’Brien, with a 1.9 rating to a 1.8 for Mr. O’Brien."

Miami: Phillip Merling, DE, ClemsonI'm surprised Merling fell this far, but that's a boon for the Dolphins, who passed on a defensive lineman with the first pick and still got a good one.2/33. St. Louis: Donnie Avery, WR, HoustonThe first wide receiver selected in the draft is not the one many expected it to be.3/34. AtlantaWashington: WR Devin ThomasThis was the receiver many expected to go first, even in the top-15. But Washington has a big target now to go with their scrappers.4/35. Kansas City: Brandon Flowers, DB, Virginia Tech5/36 Jets Green Bay: Jordy Nelson, WR, Kansas State6/37. Atlanta: Curtis Lofton, LB, Oklahoma7/38. Baltimore Seattle: John Carlson, TE, Notre DameNow the Seahawks trade up for a tight end, a position they were expected to fill in the first round. The Ravens receive the No. 55 and No. 86 pick in return.8/39. San Francisco: Chilo Rachal, G, Southern California9/40. New Orleans: Tracy Porter, CB, Indiana10/41. Buffalo: James Hardy, WR, Indiana11/42. Denver: Eddie Royal, WR, Virginia Tech12/43. CarolinaPhiladelphiaMinnesota: Tyrell Johnson, S, Arkansas StateThe Eagles fans here just want a pick to react to, but Andy Reid won't give them one. The Eagles fans will have to be a bit more patient. Barring another deal, Philadelphia will have two picks in the quick succession in, oh about, 21 minutes. The Eagles also gained an additional fourth-round pick (No. 117) in the deal, while giving up a fifth-rounder (No. 152). Philadelphia now has three fourth-round selections.13/44. Chicago: Matt Forte, RB, Tulane14/45. Detroit: Jordan Dizon, LB, Colorado15/46. Cincinnati: Jerome Simpson, WR, Coastal Carolina16/47. MinnesotaPhiladelphia: Trevor Laws, DT, Notre Dame.Eagles fans, prepping for their first pick of the draft, were dancing to Barry White's ""Can't Get Enough of Your Love.""17/48. AtlantaWashington: Fred Davis, TE, Southern California18/49. Philadelphia: DeSean Jackson, WR, CaliforniaMinutes before the selection was announced, Jackson was seen on the big TV screens here receiving a phone call and celebrating, which caused a celebration among the Eagles fans. An electrifying player whose draft stock was hurt by his size, Jackson will probably play a significant role in the return game. As one excited Eagles fan told me after the draft, ""Goodbye, Reno Mahe.""19/50. Arizona: Calais Campbell, DE, Miami (Fla.)20/51. Washington: Malcolm Kelly, WR, OklahomaWe are starting to see teams drafting highly-regarded players whose stock dropped after the combine and pro days. Campbell is one, and Kelly, coming out of college, was considered one of the top receivers available, but injuries and perceived attitude problems hurt him. But Washington may have gotten a steal, particularly when paired with its earlier pick of Devin Thomas.21/52. Tampa BayJacksonville: Quentin Groves, DE, AuburnThe Jaguars also send a fifth-round pick (No. 158) this year and a seventh-round pick next year to Tampa Bay to move up six spots.22/53. Pittsburgh: Limas Sweed, WR, TexasThis seems like another steal.23/54. Tennessee: Jason Jones, DE, Eastern Michigan24/55. Seattle Baltimore: Ray Rice, RB, Rutgers25/56. Green Bay: Brian Brohm, QB, LouisvilleThis pick got a mini-ovation from a row of Packers fans in the first mezzanine. Now that the Aaron Rodgers era has begun, Rodgers was going to need a backup. Or maybe it's competition?26/57. Miami: Chad Henne, QB, MichiganAnd here come the quarterbacks. This year's class is not deep, but it is a bit surprising that we have gone 57 picks and only four quarterbacks have been taken.27/58. JacksonvilleTampa Bay: Dexter Jackson, WR, Appalachian StateThe Buccaneers, after trading down for this pick, used up all of their seven minutes, the first team to see the clock go down to 0:00 so far in this ""streamlined"" draft, as the N.F.L. likes to call it. And they used all the time for a player they already had. Oh, different Dexter Jackson. That Jackson, a safety now with the Bengals, was the Super Bowl MVP for Tampa Bay in 2003.28/59. Indianapolis: Michael Pollak, OG, Arizona StateThis was the Colts' only first-day pick, but the last offensive lineman on a day for the trenches, which was expected. Ten offensive lineman and 11 defensive linemen were selected. Eight tackles were taken in the first round, a record.29/60. Green Bay: Patrick Lee, DB, Auburn30/61. Dallas: Martellus Bennett, TE, Texas A&M31/62. New England: Terrence Wheatley, CB, Colorado32/63. Giants: Terrell Thomas, CB, Southern CaliforniaAgain, not surprising considering the depth at the position, 10 cornerbacks were taken in a truly streamlined draft. The first two rounds took less than six hours, less time than it took to complete the first round last year."

The number is the lowest total for the “CBS Evening News” since Nielsen research introduced its new rating system in 1987. The broadcast was far more popular before that date. Ms. Couric’s ratings have been sliding since reports that she and the top management of CBS have held discussions about her future at the network, although network executives, including the chairman, Leslie Moonves, have expressed faith in her and the program. The race at the top of the newscast competition was closer than the prior week as NBC’s program beat ABC’s by about 227,000 viewers.

The Giants have won in a very hostile environment, topping the Eagles 36-31. Well played (especially by the offensive line), tremendously coached (see the Coughlin challenge on the Manning/line of scrimmage play). Nothing, and I mean nothing, is better than beating an N.F.C. East opponent on the road. Obviously, Tennessee has the better record, but having watched the Giants through nine games now, I can confidently state they are the best team in the N.F.L. Any disagreement? Now 8-1, the Giants are keyed in for a playoff run."

Sullenberger III, the pilot who successfully landed his U.S. Airways jet on the Hudson River, along with his crew. But word of the interview, to be conducted by Katie Couric, set off immediate recriminations at her former employer, the “Today’’ program on NBC. That’s because Matt Lauer of “Today’’ had received assurances from the captain’s family and other representatives last weekend that he would have the first interview with Mr. Sullenberger, which was to have been conducted live, on Jan. 19. Soon after NBC began publicizing that appearance, it was abruptly canceled, at the request of the Airline Pilots Association, which had expressed concern about its bearing on the ongoing investigation into the emergency landing. Asked in an interview on Friday why the captain had since decided to pass over “Today’’ for “60 Minutes,’’ a Sullenberger family spokesman, Alex Clemens, said, “The five members of the crew spoke with each other and made a joint decision of how they would like to proceed.’’ In a statement, NBC said, “What Captain Sullenberger did in the cockpit on Flight 1549 was heroic and admirable.

Until we know, in full, what's happening, we won't be able to tell what's wrong, much less how to counteract it.I think that people who object to The Times's reporting of the whole picture are mostly those who don't want the rest of us to put two and two together and come up with four equals Bush.Tamara P. DuvallLexington, Va., March 15, 2009 ● I usually read your column with interest, if not always with agreement. But I am, after all, a consenting adult and know what I am letting myself in for when I read the Op-Ed pages of The Times. But today's column touched bottom in a way that the economy probably hasn't yet done.You excuse Peter S. Goodman, a national economics correspondent, for his use of the word ""depression"" in a way that strains belief. First, you quote him as saying, ""My master is reality."" What sort of reality is he referring to? I would hope he means an evidence-based reality, but support for his reality takes the form of the ""Nine out of 10 dentists recommend Crest"" advertisement - true if you pick the right 10 dentists.In Mr. Goodman's case, he refers to ""two respected economists"" - an easier group to assemble even than the 10 dentists - but one does worry about who is doing the respecting. These two economists volunteered, ""in separate interviews"" (that's important, since it implies no collusion on their part), that the use of the word ""depression"" was allowable (for the Mark Zandi quote) on the grounds that ""the odds of a 'mild depression' were up to 25 percent.""This is ambiguous. It might mean that the odds had now increased to 25 percent (one in four, presumably), having previously been lower, or that those odds were now less than or equal to 25 percent, in which case one should ask, ""How much less than 25 percent could that mean?"" Which of these interpretations was implied?On top of this, the other economist, Allen Sinai, saw a 20 percent chance of a ""depressionlike possibility,"" which does tend to boggle one's mind a bit. Since a 20 percent chance is a 20 percent possibility, he sees the possibility of a possibility that resembles a depression.On these two opinions does Mr. Goodman justify himself, and you support him! Really!Anthony PoëOttawa, March 15, 2009 ● While I agree that it is not the responsibility of the news media to be a cheerleader, or to falsely represent that things are better than they perceive them to be, I think that you missed a bigger point.No one can deny that much of what is happening in this economy is psychologically driven. The psychology of a market will drive it up (think ""bubbles""), and it can, as is now happening, drive a market down.I think the point is that reporting in the present situation implies that the ""bad news"" is independent of the personal decisions of the public. The result is that people react to the bad news, creating a cycle that becomes self-fulfilling.You should do an in-depth study focused on how many people are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the ""bottom"" to then get back into the market (whether it be housing, stocks, business expansions, startups, etc).I don't doubt that the bad news is real. I just think that the element of how the bad news in and of itself creates a downward spiral is missing from the coverage.Bruce GorenLos Angeles, March 15, 2009 ● I think The Times needs to tell it like it is and not sugarcoat things because there are those who want something less than the truth.I think The Times does a fine job! I do think, however, that The Times, and the media in general, did less than a fine job of sounding the warning and challenging the Bush administration on the thinking and events leading up to war in Iraq. Everyone was going easy on telling the truth because of the public mood and for fear of losing advertising dollars.We must not repeat that mistake again. A free society cannot exist without newspapers that tell the truth.Larry A. DeyssDelmar, N.Y., March 16, 2009●●Re ""Those Persistent Anonymous Sources"" (March 22): Since you indicate that some critics of anonymous sources were themselves insisting on anonymity, let me help with comments that are on the record:In every job I have had in 45 years of journalism, from PBS to CBS News to Westinghouse (later the same company) to ABC to NPR and even as far back as college radio, anonymous sources have done their best to obscure and mislead to serve their own (or their bosses') interests, hiding disinformation behind a cloak of anonymity. Best is to treat them just as you would treat an anonymous letter: that is where reporting should start, not stop.When I was head of NPR News, over and over again anonymous sources attempted to manipulate us in all of the usual ways. But when I insisted that NPR reporters try to get sources to go on the record, in every case - every case - the story was strengthened.For example, the anonymous source's criticisms of the F.B.I. were, stripped of anonymity, then confirmed by the F.B.I. itself. That made it a better story, no?Another anonymous source's accusations about a Supreme Court nominee were, when pressed, eventually confirmed by the judge himself - and before our deadline that afternoon. Better, don't you think?And a classic election-eve anonymous source unloading a late hit against a presidential candidate was unmasked when his information, just too good to be true, was in fact, as usual, too good to check out (which is not to say that others don't fall for that clichéd gambit).When I was a reporter, when my editors asked me to go back to my sources to insist they go on the record, my sources either relented or showed how I could document their information by other means. After all, the reason they become sources is (in almost all cases) to get the story published, right?Four decades of journalism have convinced me that anonymous sources are almost never needed. Rather, they have become the crack cocaine of the newsroom, peddled everywhere for a quick hit. It's time to break the habit.Adam Clayton Powell IIIHong Kong, March 26, 2009 ●Some of the stories by the sources you cite would be inadmissible in a trial, being mostly gossip or uncorroborated.You mention 2004 as the time that this policy was adopted. I think back to stories in The Times that helped drum up the war pre-2004. And, of course, the story that Robert D. Novak let out was and still is, I think, criminal.I've been a lifelong reader of The Times, but I don't put much faith is today's so-called journalists caring much about ""the truth."" Filling space and time 24/7 seems the primary need of news organizations. I have to trust my own radar to delete the gossip, misleading statements and downright lies I read and hear.J. T. HollandWashington, March 22, 2009 ● There are questionable ethics involved when The Times publishes statements by officials who request anonymity ""because they are not authorized to comment publicly."" These officials are breaking the rules and perhaps even the law, and The Times, by publishing their comments, is abetting them. Perhaps you could comment on this in a future column.Jim LincolnConcord, Mass., March 22, 2009 ● As a reporter who covered Washington for more than 30 years, I am increasingly annoyed by the nonattribution explanations that slow up reading The Times and other papers.Why should I care that a source was ""not authorized to speak to the press""? What I care about is the information provided by the source. What I rely on is not the identity of a source but the reputation of the reporter whose byline appears on the story and the reputation for accuracy of the newspaper that publishes the report. When I was covering the Pentagon for The Washington Star and U.S. News & World Report, almost everything worth knowing was secret or above. Of course my sources for such information were anonymous, often to the chagrin of secretaries of defense and other officials who wanted to know: ""How did he know that?""Often, there was no single ""source"" at all. Reporters covering such a Byzantine place as the Pentagon get a bit of information here and another there, putting them together into a revealing story. When I went to one source with what I thought was the basis for a story, he would tell me: ""No, that's not right. Now, if you asked me . . . I would say that's classified and I can't talk about it.""My non-source was thus in a position, if asked, to say truthfully that he told me he couldn't talk about that subject while, of course, he had steered me in the right direction. I know The Times and other papers have been burned by reporters who simply lied about sources or were misled by trusted sources. But the answer to that problem is not silly rules that simply slow up the reader, but the hiring of reporters and editors of the highest integrity.Orr KellyBethesda, Md., March 22, 2009● While there are certainly times when anonymity is needed or deserved, as you point out, lately the reference to those sources seems to be used too often. And that makes one wonder whether there is really any basis to what is being reported.For instance, I read with great interest ""Love Was Blind,"" about Bank of America and Merrill Lynch (Business Day, Feb. 8) - until I hit the following paragraph: ""Interviews with almost 30 current and former Bank of America and Merrill executives and employees convey just how messy the merger has been. All of them asked not to be identified because they either did not have permission from the banks to speak or because they had signed confidentially agreements with their former employers.""Almost 30 people! All of whom spoke without authority to do so or broke their written word not to do so. At that point the reporters lost me. How could I believe the story when none of their almost 30 sources could be independently verified?John L. GoldmanRochester, March 23, 2009 ● Hats off to you for taking on the issue of anonymous sources. The difficulty of the challenge was obvious - again - in the very same issue in which your column appeared.At the end of a long business story about the so-called food revolution - hardly the kind of story that would seem to require cloak and dagger secrecy - ""a prominent food industry lobbyist who requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to reporters"" was mentioned.The earth-shattering revelation that justified this cover-up by the reporter? That the lobbyist was ""amazed"" to see many members of Congress carrying a best-selling book (""The Omnivore's Dilemma""). Secrecy won out in the business section on March 24, when Andrew Sorkin in the Dealbook column quotes ""one senior Goldman executive who insisted on not being quoted by name for fear of crossing the Treasury Department.""This in a newspaper that has constantly railed in recent months about the lack of transparency in the gargantuan financial industry bailout. Seems like the reporters and columnists are being permitted - maybe encouraged? - to be enablers of the very lack of transparency that they decry.There's little reason to think that the flood of unnamed sources will slow down much. But you shining a light on this problem at least makes the reporters and editors squirm a bit.Frank HamsherSt. Louis, March 24, 2009 ● It seems as though when discussing non-people facts, the source should be available and be willing to be quoted.When talking about opinion or theory, who cares about the source? The important aspect is for people to evaluate the message - not the messenger.All messengers are consciously or unconsciously biased anyway. And to a large extent the news media do no favors by substituting messenger evaluation for message evaluation.Paul F. HosmanKalamazoo, Mich., March 22, 2009 ● I enjoyed your column discussing the reasons informants are not identified.I've been fascinated by the endless number of explanations. I like the variety - there seems to be an obligation to come up with new excuses for granting anonymity. I particularly like it when explanations are at least somewhat factual - ""feared the consequences of identifying himself,"" ""did not have permission to speak"" or ""because of the sensitivity of the subject.""To be really factual, how about, ""We were afraid we would be sued,"" or ""The Editor is a coward""?Dick SherwoodSouth Dartmouth, Mass., March 22, 2009 ●One major problem with the practice of offering sources anonymity is that it is simply extraordinarily contagious. People read the paper, notice the prevalence of unnamed sources, and wonder why they should speak on the record when no one else does.The reasons for desiring to remain out of the spotlight in our increasingly polarized and dangerous society are entirely understandable. Newspaper reporters certainly have a daunting task of persuading people to speak on the record added to the chore of writing a thorough and fair piece, but if editors and publishers don't enforce standards with consistency, the whole enterprise becomes indistinguishable from gossip mongering.Think for a moment of newspapers' main competition - television newscasts.How often do we see TV relying on unidentified sources? Sure, once in a while we get the blurred face, anonymous silhouette, or distorted voice, but it's remarkably rare. If you want to provide information or comment on a TV news story, you not only get your name used, but you are usually photographed. Why can't print news make the same demands?Charles ClouseSanta Barbara, Calif., March 24, 2009 ● You write, ""The policy says anonymous sources should be used only as 'a last resort when the story is of compelling public interest and the information is not available any other way.'""Maybe if editors designated assignments in advance so that reporters knew which stories they would be covering would not be news of ""compelling public interest,"" the reporters would recognize that they simply could not get certain stories published with any anonymous sources.It also seems as if reporters covering compelling news should have to justify in writing their use of anonymous sources. They should have to explain at a minimum why anonymity is a last resort, efforts they have made to get the source on the record and how their investigation has led them to conclude that the information could not be obtained from another reliable open source.Although it may not always be possible, the reporter's pledge of anonymity should be given only after the reporter has obtained prior written approval from an editor, with that editor's written conclusions as to why anonymity is being granted.While forcing reporters and editors to document in writing the grant of anonymity in each case might be somewhat burdensome at first, it seems that if the procedures were put in place as regular expectations, both reporters and editors would adapt. It is also likely that both groups would become less willing to grant anonymity, except in extraordinary cases.As with the corrections page of The Times, it is possible that the newspaper could include a daily anonymous sourcing note, explaining in which story (or stories) anonymity had been granted and why.Patrick MattimoreGex, France, March 22, 2009 ● Consider this: A reporter quotes an anonymous source in an article and a lawsuit is filed, perhaps for defamation of character or false accusations. Should the reporter have to testify and name the anonymous source who gave the information that resulted in the lawsuit?Over the last 15 years, and even more so during the last 8, I believe there are a number of factors that contributed to the rise in the use of anonymous sources: (1) A real fear that making an accusation on the record could result in losing one's job or being ostracized by a community; (2) the fast pace at which news breaks means that reporters don't always have the time to look for other sources before writing a story; and (3) a general sense that citing an anonymous source adds credibility to any story.Unfortunately, the overall acceptance of anonymous source reporting means we have now found ourselves living in a culture where all one has to do is make an anonymous accusation or give an anonymous tip and it becomes fact in newsrooms around the world. No confirmation required. Lives and careers have been destroyed as a result of that policy.Rebekah JensenMorrisville, N.C., March 22, 2009●●Re ""No Comment. But You Didn't Hear It From Me"" (March 29): I hope that you will take a look at The Times's policies and practices in identifying ""people in the street"" in articles from places with repressive governments, particularly when they make critical comments.I have the impression that too often The New York Times relies on interviewees to request anonymity rather than expecting its reporters and/or editors to provide it, even if not requested, in potentially risky situations.The exact name of a noodle salesman in Shanghai really does not add enough to a story to justify putting his freedom or even life at risk.Minot NettletonWoodbridge, Conn., March 29, 2009 ● As a onetime ink-stained wretch and later a P.R. man, your column on anonymous sources and spokesmen grabbed me. I find objectionable the widespread use of aides or P.R. people as spokesmen for decision-makers. Whatever happened to the management maxim, ""The buck stops here""- the code that disapproved of leaders passing the buck down the line and shirking their duties?I was taught that the media-relations role of a P.R. person is as a liaison between management and the press: to arrange for a reporter to speak directly to the person responsible for the part of the organization in which the reporter is interested.Management people are often reluctant to speak to the press and prefer to hide behind a spokesman. Fortunately, my boss accepted my perspective and, as C.E.O., was able to insist that except for requests for commonplace information, appropriate managers, not P.R. people, speak with reporters.Hal HoldenNorth Vancouver, British Columbia, March 29, 2009 ● I don't want to know why anonymous quotes are unattributed or off the record. That answer is usually vague, vacuous and formulaic, and provides no useful context or resulting import.I want to know why these sources are talking. Every reporter should ask this every time. ""Why are you telling me this?"" That's the context I need to understand the information (spin?) that sources are providing.Yes, in many (most) cases you'll get hand-waving and fatuity. And in many cases the reporter knows the answer perfectly well already. But your readers don't.And if reporters don't ask the question, they are quite reasonably precluded from imputing the source's motive(s) in print. This leaves your readers to do that imputing (and they will do so) absent the context necessary to do so.If the question is asked - and pressed - every time, it could have some small effect on the culture of anonymity. Sources might have to actually ask themselves the question. Even if they spin the answer, they might not be able to do so with complete success. (Think: reporters' Spidey senses.) In some cases, the source's answer would provide a necessary context or frame or lens through which I can discern the true import of what is being reported and quoted. The source's statements, so framed, might take on a significantly different or even opposite meaning. In some cases, the frame is the story.Over time the pressure of the question being consistently asked and pressed - and the answer being reported - could result in a salutary change to the overly cozy culture in whose talons reporters so often find themselves pinioned.Steve RothSeattle, March 30, 2009"

Scott Baio! Eva Gabor!) and, most of all, the marble columns, velvet banquettes and plush suites of the St. Gregory Hotel. Today Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS released the show's first season (it ran for five) on DVD, so I checked in for a stay on memory lane.""Hotel"" was often compared to ""The Love Boat,"" which it certainly mirrored in structure: there were the St. Gregory's staff members - including the omnipresent manager, Peter McDermott (Brolin); his assistant, Christine Francis (Connie Sellecca); the guest relations manager, Mark Danning (Shea Farrell); and the security guy, Billy Griffin (Nathan Cook) - and an ever-changing roster of hotel guests, played by the aforementioned special guest stars.

The Hollywood Reporter said that NBC has ordered a pilot episode of a new “Prime Suspect” series intended for audiences in the United States, to be written by Hank Steinberg, the creator of the CBS crime series “Without a Trace.” The original “Prime Suspect,” which was created by Lynda La Plante and first shown in Britain on the ITV network in 1991, starred Ms. Mirren (“The Queen”) as Jane Tennison, a detective chief inspector contending with her first substantial murder investigation as well as the sexist attitudes of her mostly male coworkers. Seven “Prime Suspect” series were produced through 2006, and broadcasts on PBS help introduce American viewers to Tom Wilkinson and Ralph Fiennes. No casting has yet been announced for the American version of the show."

In college football, the regular season is the playoffs. Think about this weekend's Alabama/L.S.U. game. A 3:30 p.m. game on a November Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium with the SEC West on the line definitely has a playoff feel about it. Ohio State/Penn State at Beaver Stadium is basically an elimination game in the Big Ten. At this point in the season, every week is a playoff game for teams like Iowa, Texas, Florida, Boise State, T.C.U. and Cincinnati. The more teams that are undefeated the more important it gets not to lose. No one can afford a let down.

Mr. Abu Aita, an interview subject who is characterized as a terrorist in the movie, says he has been misrepresented and is suing Mr. Baron Cohen for slander, The Associated Press reported. In the film Mr. Baron Cohen (in the guise of Brüno, above) travels to the Middle East and interviews Mr. Abu Aita, who he says is a leader of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. Mr. Baron Cohen explained how the scene was created during an interview on “Late Show With David Letterman” in July: “We thought, what could people see that they’ve never seen before on film? And we thought one thing would be a comedian interviewing a terrorist.” Mr. Abu Aita has previously said he is not a member of Al Aksa, and is a member of a regional committee of Fatah, the dominant party in the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank. In his lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, Mr. Abu Aita said he is a Christian and a “peace-loving person who abhors violence,” according to The A.P. He also said that the “Brüno” interview was not conducted at a secret location, as Mr. Baron Cohen has said, but at a hotel he chose. Mr. Abu Aita also named NBC Universal, which distributed the film, and its director, Larry Charles, in the lawsuit, as well as CBS, which broadcasts “Late Show,” and Mr. Letterman’s production company, Worldwide Pants."

4401,2009/12/20,THE ASPIRATIONAL WOMAN,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/magazine/20Meyers-t.html,"I. NANCY MEYERS may be a singular figure in Hollywood -- may, in fact, be the most powerful female writer-director-producer currently working (not that there's much competition) -- but that doesn't appear to give the 60-year-old blonde a whole lot of social clout. On a Monday evening in late October, for instance, it didn't stop the owner of Vincenti, a small, much-in-demand Italian eatery in Brentwood, from asking Meyers whether she would mind switching tables come 8 p.m. True, ours was a prime corner booth, and the owner, a fierce-looking woman with coal-black hair who would fit nicely into a Fellini film, assured Meyers that she was only being asked this favor because the person who requested the table was an investor in the restaurant. (He turned out to be Howard Weitzman, a lawyer whose clients have included O. J. Simpson and Michael Jackson.) But it still gave me pause. You know, the whole sexual-politics thing rearing its timeworn, fractious head: a powerful man trumps any woman. (''When you describe how influential I am in Hollywood,'' Meyers ruefully observed to me, ''say we were thrown out of our booth.'') As we got up to move at the appointed hour, John Burnham, an agent and executive vice president at International Creative Management and an old friend of hers who happened to be sitting at the table next to ours, expressed outrage on our behalf, offering to confront the owner personally. But Meyers just shrugged and laughed, stopping on our way to a table in deep steerage to trade hellos with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer."
