Often inspired by Greek gods, sports figures or city names, the code names turn up in early presentations in place of actual company names, which, at least in theory, are supposed to stay secret until an agreement is announced. A common approach is to substitute a word with the same first letter of each company, although deal makers sometimes get more fanciful.",

Yao, who was chief executive of the former Student Finance Corporation, claimed that he did not commit fraud when he lied in federal bankruptcy court about wiring $669,000 to his mistress at the time, a former Playboy Playmate of the Month.

The two were at one of the tables nestled in that restaurant's brightest corner, in the garden of the Rockefeller Apartments, the swankily modernist, bifurcated building whose two undulating facades erupt north onto 55th Street and south onto 54th Street, right across from the Museum of Modern Art's sculpture garden. Mr. McGrath's eyes wandered happily up and down the elegant, glassy bays and he said, as he recalled recently: ""This is a building that looks like the architect actually cared about it. I've always wanted to live here. I wonder who I'd call?"" And Mr. Blake said: ""Well, I live here. I know exactly who to call.""",

Albany started a $10 million program to convert its fleet of 600 hybrid vehicles to plug-in electric vehicles and pledged to spend another $10 million to encourage gas stations to install ethanol pumps. Because companies bidding for New York's conversion business must promise to build their facilities in the state, the plan may help move New York to the vanguard of a small industry with big potential. New York's commitment, combined with Google's recent announcement that its new investment company will focus on commercializing an electric/alcohol vehicle, gives increased momentum to a technological concept that is rapidly winning supporters. In less than three years, a coalition of environmentalists, entrepreneurs and tinkerers has developed a viable strategy to reduce our dependence on oil and relieve pollution in densely populated areas like metropolitan New York.",

[Page A1.] MORE THAN HOME IMPROVEMENT -- Home Depot is displaying a growing willingness to stray from its single-minded focus on home improvement. The company's experiment with everyday products like gas, cigarettes and seasonal decorations exemplifies the belief of the chief executive, Robert L.

[C1.] CONCERNS ON RADIO PLAY -- In the last two weeks, songs from two record labels -- both distributed through Vivendi's Universal Music Group -- got a lift on the charts after a radio chain was paid to play the tunes in an advertising program that New York state officials say is used to trick radio programmers. The ad purchases come five months after Universal settled accusations that it bribed radio programmers with gifts like laptop computers and luxury hotel stays in exchange for airplay. [C1.] A NOD TO PREVENTIVE CARE -- With the number of uninsured Americans reaching a record 46.6 million last year, a handful of hospital systems around the country have done the math and decided that for many patients with chronic diseases, it would be cheaper to provide free preventive care than to absorb the high cost of repeated emergencies.

[C6.] UNLIKELY USES FOR RICO -- Some corporations are using the RICO statutes, often associated with mob bosses and corrupt union chiefs, to attack other companies, including many that have headquarters overseas.

Albany started a $10 million program to convert its fleet of 600 hybrid vehicles to plug-in electric vehicles and pledged to spend another $10 million to encourage gas stations to install ethanol pumps. Because companies bidding for New York's conversion business must promise to build their facilities in the state, the plan may help move New York to the vanguard of a small industry with big potential. New York's commitment, combined with Google's recent announcement that its new investment company will focus on commercializing an electric/alcohol vehicle, gives increased momentum to a technological concept that is rapidly winning supporters.

Now, because of the subprime crisis, banks are again turning away borrowers with poor credit, and industry executives expect these borrowers will again turn to so-called ''hard money'' lenders. This time, though, borrowers will have more legal protection against unscrupulous lenders. ''Lenders aren't as interested now in lending to some individuals because they're going to have a harder time repaying,'' said Hugh Bromma, the chief executive of the Entrust Group Inc., a financial advisory company in Reno, Nev., that helps clients lend money on the private market, among other things. ''Those people will have to go to private lenders, where the standards are significantly different.''",

Her extraordinary accomplishments continued after she retired from singing, and we were fortunate to have her as a Managing Director of our Board beginning in 1991 and as Chairman from 2003 to 2005.

The Board and staff of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. are deeply saddened by the passing of Beverly Sills, legendary artist of extraordinary achievement in the world's musical arena, and in the history of Lincoln Center. One of the 20th century's greatest coloratura sopranos, Beverly had a longstanding association with Lincoln Center's New York City Opera and Metropolitan Opera. She was named General Director of New York City Opera after her retirement from the stage in 1980, and was responsible for launching the careers of many young singers. Chairman of Lincoln Center, Inc. from 1994-2002, she was the first woman and professional musician to serve in that position. Her tireless championship of the arts and irresistible personal warmth raised millions of dollars for Lincoln Center. She oversaw the beginning of ''Lincoln Center Festival'' and the ''American Songbook'' series during her tenure, as well as early plans for Lincoln Center's current redevelopment project. She subsequently served as Chairman of The Metropolitan Opera until 2005. Beverly was a major force in popularizing the performing arts in general and opera in particular through her numerous network television appearances, highlighted by many years as the host of ''Live From Lincoln Center.'' She was the recipient of countless honors in tribute to her work as a humanitarian and for her contributions to the arts. The loss of her voice leaves an unimaginable void, but Beverly's legacy will remain. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to her children Muffy and Peter Jr. and her extended family. Frank A. Bennack, Jr., Chairman Reynold Levy, President Bruce Crawford, Chairman Emeritus Gordon Davis, Former President Nathan Leventhal, President Emeritus Martin E. Segal, Chairman Emeritus George Weissman, Chairman Emeritus Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. SILLS--Beverly. New York City Opera deeply mourns the passing of Beverly Sills, our beloved former prima donna, General Director, and board member, affiliated with our company for over 50 years. She was much more than a consummate artist, more than a gifted leader, more than a loyal friend to us; she was an inspiration, a force of nature. On October 29, 1955, Beverly Sills changed both City Opera's destiny and her own, debuting with the company as Rosalinda in Die Fledermaus. She swiftly rose within the ranks with vivid portrayals of Philine in Mignon (1956) and Violetta in Traviata (1957), achieving true stardom in 1958 with her unforgettable portrayal of the title role in The Ballad of Baby Doe, later recorded by Columbia Records. On September 27, 1966, during City Opera's first season at Lincoln Center, Sills' vocally and dramatically virtuosic performance as Cleopatra in the company's first-ever Handel opera, Giulio Cesare, catapulted Sills (and City Opera) to international renown. The company swiftly began mounting new productions especially for her, most notably Manon (1968) and a series of hand-picked bel canto operas. Sills' City Opera performances of Lucia di Lammermoor (1969), Elvira in I Puritani (1974), Marie in Daughter of the Regiment (1975), and the famous Donizetti Three Queens trilogy Roberto Devereux (1970), Maria Stuarda (1972), and Anna Bolena (1973) helped to spark a vast bel canto revival. Sills' supple, crystalline voice was soon in demand far beyond the bounds of Lincoln Center. A working mother blessed with a husband of means (the late journalist Peter Greenough) and a doting mom (the late Shirley Silverman), Sills took to the road with her family in tow. She made notable debuts at companies including San Diego Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Vienna State Opera, La Scala, Covent Garden, Teatro Coln in Buenos Aires, and the Metropolitan Opera, in historic 1975 performances of The Siege of Corinth. But she always returned home to City Opera. Sills' warm, ebullient personality led to a love affair with the television camera, not only in opera broadcasts but on variety and talk shows. As she clowned on TV with the likes of Miss Piggy, Carol Burnett, Danny Kaye, and Johnny Carson, she simultaneously served as a homegrown, one-woman ambassador for the arts and as radiant, smiling proof of operas passion, liveliness, and immediacy. At the age of 51, after more than four decades of public performances, and having sung 35 roles at City Opera (and 32 elsewhere), Beverly Sills retired from the stage with a starstudded televised Gala Concert at City Opera, on October 27, 1980. Without skipping a beat, she put her celebrity into service as a tireless advocate for such worthy causes as the March of Dimes and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and as an important leader in the performing arts. From 1979-1989, she served as City Opera's General Director, adding 42 new works to our repertory, shepherding us triumphantly through a disastrous warehouse fire, and mentoring countless young American singers. She served on City Opera's Board of Directors from 1989-1991, and remained an honorary board member until her death. Such services earned her the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1980) and the Kennedy Center Honors (1985). From 1994-2002, Sills continued to serve City Opera as Chairwoman of Lincoln Center, until becoming Chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera Board of Directors (2002-2005). All the while, she remained a true friend and trusted advisor to City Opera and to many individuals within our company. We are comforted by her recorded legacy of 18 full-length studio opera recordings, and numerous live opera and solo albums, most of which have been reissued digitally to preserve her radiant artistry and joie de vivre for generations to come. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire company, we extend deepest sympathy to her family -daughter Meredith (''Muffy'') and her son Peter, Jr. (Bucky). In addition, there are generations of colleagues, scores of friends, and legions of fans who have made up her City Opera family. We will never be the same without her. She was a warm and wonderful friend. We loved her very much and will miss her terribly. Susan L. Baker, Chairman The New York City Opera Board of Directors SILLS--Beverly.

We will all miss her. Sanford Fisher, Chairman Barry Tucker, President SILLS--Beverly. Dear Muffy, your mother meant so much to so many institutions and to such a large public because of her immense artistic talent and leadership skills. But to my father in Cleveland, to you all your life, and to us in New York and on the Vineyard, she was a generous spirit of immeasurable fun, whimsy and love. We were all so lucky to be closely connected to her. Thank you for all you did to make her so proud. We extend our love and sympathy to you. Aggie and Daniel SILLS--Beverly.

As editor in chief of Time Inc., he had been battling Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the tenacious special prosecutor investigating the Valerie Wilson case. Mr. Fitzgerald had issued subpoenas to a number of Washington journalists, among them the Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper, seeking information about their contacts with administration officials who might have been involved in leaking Ms. Wilson's identity as an undercover intelligence agent. When they refused to comply, both Mr. Cooper and Time Inc. were held in contempt. Mr. Pearlstine took the case all the way to the Supreme Court, which early that summer declined to review it. Having thus exhausted all legal remedies, he faced a stark choice: He could continue resisting -- meaning jail time for Mr. Cooper and costly fines for Time Inc. -- or wave the white flag.",

He was 79. The family will hold a memorial and celebration of his life later this spring. The son of Norwegian immigrants Olaf Jensen and Sigrid Anderson Jensen, he was born in Manhattan, NY, on October 17, 1927, as Finn Eric Fjell Jensen. Mr. Jensen was a graduate of Brooklyn Technical High School (1945), Cornell University (B.S., ILR, 1951), Brooklyn Law School (J.D., 1956), and the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School (1968). He served in the U.S. Army 1946-1947 and was in Japan during 1947. He played tackle on Cornell University's championship football teams of 1948, 1949 and 1950. Known at Cornell as 'Red' Jensen, at 6 feet 4 and one-half inches and 225 pounds, he was the epitome of the Big Red. He'd always wanted to work for Bethlehem Steel Corp. He did, starting out after graduation at the company's 56th Street shipyard in Brooklyn, NY, as a safety engineer. He convinced the dock workers that wearing hard hats wasn't just for sissies. Doing so took some muscle: The family story is that his beating several dock workers at arm-wrestling helped get his point across. He worked in the shipyard days and attended Brooklyn Law nights. He then became an arbitration attorney for the company and moved to Bethlehem, PA. He was a member of Bethlehem Steel's negotiating team for some well-known strikes of the 1950s, including the historic 116-day steel strike of 1959. In 1961 he moved to ACF Industries, Inc. in New York City, where he was Vice President for Industrial Relations (1965-1979) and Vice President for Government and Labor Relations (1979-1985). Jensen was known on both sides of the table as a tough but fair negotiator. Mr. Jensen received the prestigious Judge Wm. B. Groat Award from Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations in 1971 in recognition of his contributions to the field and service to the school. He was active in Cornell alumni affairs, including serving as the chair of the ILR School's Advisory Council and was elected a life member of the Cornell University Council. After retirement from ACF, he regularly served as an arbitrator for Con Edison. He was of counsel to Epstein, Becker & Green, P.C. of Stamford, Conn. (1986-1995) and to Keane & Beane, P.C. in White Plains, NY (1995-2004). He was also an adjunct professor at the business school and the law school of Pace University in Pleasantville, NY, where he taught classes in collective bargaining and industrial relations. He was a member of St. Matthew's Lutheran Church in White Plains, where he was active in church matters, serving on the church council, including as president, for many years. He is survived by his wife, Janet C. Jensen of Sleepy Hollow, NY; two daughters, Mari N. Jensen of Tucson, AZ and Deborah B. Jensen of Seattle; his son, Eric D. Jensen of Newhall, CA; his brother, Fred O. Jensen of Chatham, MA; and three grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the scholarship fund Mr. Jensen and Jack Sheinkman established for students at Cornell University's ILR school.

Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'AS YET THOU ART YOUNG AND RASH' An abstract collage of shards of feeling built out of Euripides' ''Suppliant Women,'' this meditation on grief and the death of children in senseless war offers plenty of parallels to current society without doing anything so obvious as explicitly referring to them. The five-member cast, led by three beautiful middle-aged women, is strong; the director, David Herskovits, has helped them shape an evocative piece that might be too nonliteral for some tastes, but is both moving and distinctive (1:10). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) 'DUTCHMAN' A revival of the poet Amiri Baraka's screed on race and American values, 43 years after its Greenwich Village debut, aims for all the fire and might of a Malcolm X speech but none of the rhetorical elegance. It shouts so loudly that you can't hear a thing (1:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Anita Gates) 'NO GREAT SOCIETY' The brainy experimentalists of Elevator Repair Service provide a madcap and almost dreamlike re-enactment of a 1968 episode of William F. Buckley's ''Firing Line,'' which features Mr. Buckley squaring off with Jack Kerouac (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'THE SCENE' Theresa Rebeck's latest is a sharp-witted, sharp-elbowed comedy about the savage economies of sex and show business in Manhattan. Tony Shalhoub plays an out-of-work actor, Charlie, happily married -- but not really -- to Patricia Heaton's frazzled chat show booker. Enter the femme fatale Clea, played by the gifted Anna Camp, and goodbye, Charlie (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood) * 'TOYS IN THE ATTIC' Austin Pendleton's fine revival of Lillian Hellman's last play faithfully attacks the corrosive attachments of family. What good is a family, and thus a society, the play implicitly asks, that can only look in the mirror? (2:30) Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) 'VICTORIA MARTIN: MATH TEAM QUEEN' Must all stage teenagers speak in that exaggerated surfer-dude style in which ''awesome'' and ''totally'' make up about 50 percent of any conversation? Yes, apparently they must, from the evidence presented in this thin comedy, which is about a high school girl who finds herself on the all-male math team. The playwright, Kathryn Walat, seems to have been trying to grab the coattails of a certain spelling-bee-related show. She missed (2:00). The Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WOMEN OF TRACHIS' In Kate Ryan's wonderfully perceptive adaptation, Sophocles' rarely produced tragedy about the death of the hero Heracles and his wife, Deianira, has terrific contemporary traction. Alice Reagan's superbly cast and infectiously energetic production is fun, intelligent and eminently worth seeing. (1:00). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Jonathan Kalb) Off Off Broadway * 'THE DIRTY TALK' Kevin Cristaldi and Sidney Williams are just great in this two-hander by Michael Puzzo about strangers stranded in a hunting cabin. How they came to be there is hilariously doled out by Mr. Puzzo, along with some thoughts about identity, the Internet and the liar in all of us. Padraic Lillis, the director, has the two actors in perfect sync (1:20). Center Stage, 41 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30).

(Brantley) Last Chance * 'A BEAUTIFUL VIEW' The Canadian playwright and director Daniel MacIvor mines two funny, subdued and entirely affecting performances from Caroline Gillis and Tracy Wright as women whose enduring friendship may be more (1:20). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'THE BROTHERS SIZE' Loosely based on West African myths, this impressive and emotionally absorbing debut by Tarrell Alvin McCraney portrays two battling brothers in Louisiana (1:30). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) * 'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'DEAD SET #3' Themes of apocalypse and trauma echo throughout the Big Art Group's flashy and shallow new entry in the ever-expanding genre of high-tech theater (1:15). The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11; closes tomorrow.

(Zinoman) 'INVINCIBLE SUMMER' The performance artist Mike Daisey's monologue is a showcase of facile observation. During his first summer in New York six years ago, he discovers that it's hot and that people are generally much nicer than their comportment on subways would lead you to believe (1:30). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) * 'THE VIETNAMIZATION OF NEW JERSEY (AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY)' A revival of Christopher Durang's satire of war, family life and Bicentennial fever, on the 30th anniversary of its debut at the Yale Repertory Theater, swishes along at the speed of a Nascar race. Blanche Baker is a gem as an out-of-it 1970s matron who just can't dust off the Eisenhower era. The Beckett Theater, on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ALPHA DOG' (R, 117 minutes) Based on a true Southern California crime, Nick Cassavetes's entertaining exploitation flick features a lot of attractive, talented young actors shimmying across the screen while embodying the collective parental nightmare. Do you know where your children are? Well, in this film they're getting busy, chilling out, smoking blunts and chugging coolers faster than a toothless wino. Oh, and committing murder. (Manohla Dargis) 'ALONE WITH HER' (No rating, 79 minutes) In this voyeuristic thriller, a young man named Doug (Colin Hanks) becomes smitten with a coffee shop waitress named Amy (Ana Claudia Talancón) and tries to insinuate himself into her life through high-tech means, videotaping her routines from afar, then bugging her apartment. In the end, though, the characters seem less archetypal than vague, and aside from its sophisticated presentation, the film doesn't differ all that much from its template -- the late 1980s/early '90s Fill-in-the-Blanks-From-Hell movies that followed ''Fatal Attraction,'' many of whose elements are revived almost verbatim. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES' (PG, 94 minutes) Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy (Freddie Highmore) who shrinks to microscopic size to find some gems and his missing grandfather. Lots of famous names (Madonna, Robert De Niro, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg) lend their voices to the computerized part of the movie, but only briefly near the end does everything click. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Dargis) * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) * 'GOD GREW TIRED OF US' (PG, 90 minutes) This sober, uplifting documentary, which won two major awards at last year's Sundance Film Festival, follows the resettlement in the United States of three Sudanese young men uprooted as children by the civil war. Handsomely photographed, and inspirational but not cloyingly so, it is the rare contemporary documentary that doesn't leave a residue of cynicism and outrage. (Stephen Holden) 'THE HITCHER' (R, 90 minutes) Like the 1986 cult favorite of the same title, this remake is a crash-and-burn action horror film with intellectual pretensions. The overachieving Irish character actor Sean Bean plays the Hitcher as a philosophical sadist, toying with people who didn't get the memo saying that God is dead, but the movie is too shallow to embellish that vision. The merger of mystical solemnity and chain-reaction slapstick suggests a Road Runner cartoon directed by John Woo. (Seitz) 'THE ITALIAN' (PG-13, 99 minutes, in Russian) This dark fairy tale from Russia pulls you into a richly atmospheric, persuasively inhabited world teeming with young foundlings and pathos, and upended by one remarkable little boy. (Dargis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'MAFIOSO' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Italian) This 1962 film, revived by Rialto Pictures, is a rambunctious, astonishing blend of farce, thriller and social satire. The director, Alberto Lattuada, follows an up-and-coming Fiat manager (Alberto Sordi) on a visit from Milan to his native village in Sicily. His homecoming is full of surprises -- painful for him, altogether delightful for the audience. (Scott) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zoë Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis) 'PRIMEVAL' (R, 94 minutes) A giant crocodile named Gustave terrorizes Western journalists in war-torn Burundi. Not as much fun as it might have been, but not as terrible either. (Scott) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) * 'REGULAR LOVERS' (No rating, 175 minutes, in French) Philippe Garrel's tender portrait of late-1960s French youth stars the filmmaker's son, Louis Garrel, as a 20-year-old Parisian struggling through the fires of revolutionary promise and its smoldering remains. Magnificent. (Dargis) 'STOMP THE YARD' (PG-13, 109 minutes) Brotherhood is powerful in this sometimes compelling, sometimes complacent movie about stepping and African-American fraternity life at an Atlanta institution called Truth University. D J (Columbus Short), a street-style dancer, needs to find his place in a university ruled by Gammas and Thetas and stepping. (Rachel Saltz) 'TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Thai) A western weepie from Thailand, filmed in garish color. In spite of the relentless genre pastiche, it has a charming sincerity. (Scott) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) Film Series CRITICS CHOICE: GREAT DOCUMENTARIES (Sunday) A series of significant documentaries introduced by members of the New York Film Critics Circle continues with Ross McElwee's family history ''Bright Leaves'' (2003), presented by Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, and Werner Herzog's ''Grizzly Man,'' a 2005 study of a man who mistakenly (and tragically) believed that he understood bears, presented by Kyle Smith of The New York Post. (Through Feb. 25.) Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Dave Kehr) I AM NOT A WAR PHOTOGRAPHER: FILMS OF LYNNE SACHS (Tonight through Sunday) Three programs of nontraditional documentaries by a filmmaker who employs subjective perspectives and abstract visual effects to examine contemporary conflicts. Tonight ''Which Way Is East: Notebooks from Vietnam'' (1994) is doubled with ''Investigation of a Flame: The Catonsville Nine'' (2001). Tomorrow brings a program of four short films and ''Invisible,'' a 30-minute work-in-progress. Sunday's screening is ''States of Unbelonging,'' a new video feature about Revital Ohayon, an Israeli filmmaker killed in 2002 in a terrorist attack near the West Bank. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr) STORM WARNINGS: THE FILMS OF BAHMAN FARMANARA (Tonight through Thursday) This retrospective focuses on the work of one of the few Iranian directors to work before and after the revolution. His ''Prince Ehtejab'' (1974), screening tonight, tomorrow and Monday, is a Visconti-like historical epic about the end of the Qajar Dynasty, centered on the last prince of the line, who withdraws from political conflict into the private reality of his palace. An international success, it led to Mr. Farmanara's appointment as the head of the Iranian Film Development Company, but his 1979 work ''Tall Shadows in the Wind'' (tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) was banned by the shah's shaky government, and Mr. Farmanara spent the next several years in Canada, eventually returning to the new Iran, where he encountered a different form of censorship. After having 10 scripts rejected by the government censors, he was able to film in 2000 the gently satiric, self-reflective ''Smell of Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine'' (tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday), a hit at the New York Film Festival that marked Mr. Farmanara's comeback. The series also includes two recent films, ''A Little Kiss'' from 2005 (tonight through Wednesday) and ''A House Built on Water'' from 2002 (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. THE BOOKS (Tomorrow) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of disembodied vocal samples, a few plucks from a banjo or another string instrument, and unclassifiable noises that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening is trying to figure out just why all this chaos works so wonderfully and wittily. With Jack Rose and Essie Jain. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Ben Sisario) * DAVID BYRNE (Thursday) He may have set a still unsurpassed standard with Talking Heads for art-pop that is as arty as it is truly poppy, but Mr. Byrne's influence reaches much wider than the rock world, into theater, film and, especially, world music. (He also has the best blog of any rock star, at davidbyrne.com.) He begins his four-day Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall with music from ''The Knee Plays,'' a 1985 collaboration with the theater director Robert Wilson, which features Mr. Byrne's work as well as arrangements of gospel and Bulgarian folk songs. At 9 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35 to $45. (Sisario) RHYS CHATHAM (Tomorrow) A force in the fruitful meeting of drone minimalism with loud guitar-rock in the 1970s, Mr. Chatham remains a lover of big, electrified din. For his current tour he revisits a 1970s piece, ''Guitar Trio,'' with members of his band augmented by a phalanx of guitarists, including Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, an important inheritor of Mr. Chatham's style. At 8 p.m., Issue Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org; $25. (Sisario) DEERHOOF (Tonight) More than a decade into its career, this avant-garde rock band from San Francisco still has plenty of surprises. Deerhoof's stop-start songs, with jagged guitars, a drum style somewhere between jazz and metal, and Satomi Matsuzaki's nursery rhyme vocals, sound intriguingly extraterrestrial. With Busdriver and Proton Proton. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $16. (Sisario) EARLY YEARS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Destination: trippy outer space. Vehicle: buoyant, puslating guitars of this young British band, which borrows from 1980s and '90s neo-psych visionaries like My Bloody Valentine and Spacemen 3. Tonight at 8, with Daylight's for the Birds, a New York band equally devoted to '80s British ''dream pop''; at Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $8. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484; $8. (Sisario) ISAAC HAYES (Tomorrow) From his days as a songwriter and producer at Stax/Volt to the orchestrated funk of his album ''Hot Buttered Soul'' to his former cartoon role (as Chef) in ''South Park,'' Isaac Hayes has adapted his deep voice and down-home charm to every era. At 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $40 in advance, $45 at the door. (Jon Pareles) JOHNNY SOCIETY (Tonight) Johnny Society is led by Kenny Siegal, a songwriter who scuffs up the melodicism of the Beatles and Brian Wilson in songs that know all too well about how relationships can crumble. With the London Souls, Le Firm, the Luxury Flats and the Shills. At 8, Sin-é, 150 Attorney Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077, sin-e.com; $10. (Pareles) SLEEPY LABEEF(Sunday) An unregenerate rockabilly singer and guitarist from Arkansas, Sleepy LaBeef reels off one twangy tune after another, known and obscure, like a jukebox come to life. At 10 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500, rodeobar.com; no cover. (Pareles) * LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Wednesday and Thursday) Now in its ninth season, this series has greatly expanded from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like. Wednesday features an acoustic show by Josh Ritter, a 30-year-old songwriter whose guileless, boy-next-door voice belies the depth and ambition of his songs, whether he is confessing a simple crush or following his thoughts on a long, Whitmanesque incantation. On Thursday Howard Fishman, who has long been rummaging through the attic of American song, pays tribute to Bob Dylan and the Band's monumental ''Basement Tapes.'' At 8:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; sold out on Wednesday, $35 to $70 on Thursday. (Sisario) * MAUDE MAGGART (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) In her must-see cabaret show, ''Good Girl/Bad Girl,'' this 31-year-old singer, a knockout in a red dress, uses an astutely chosen selection of songs to explore conflicting female sexual stereotypes from the perspective of a young woman who understands but rejects abject surrender to a man. High point: Joan Baez's ''Love Song to a Stranger.'' At 9, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $25 minimum, with $65 dinner required for the early shows tonight and tomorrow. (Stephen Holden) RITA MORENO (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) If you look as fresh and unbowed as Rita Moreno at 75, you may as well flaunt your age, which is what Ms. Moreno does with zest and humor in ''Little Tributes,'' her breezy new cabaret act. The show is a smooth, comfortable ride with a performer who knows who she is. At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow at 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; tonight and tomorrow, $70 cover at tables, $50 at the bar; Tuesday through Thursday, $65 at tables, $40 at the bar. (Holden) NORTHSIX (Tonight and Wednesday night) Another rock club bites the dust, but this time there's a twist: the gentrification is happening in Brooklyn, not Manhattan, and the gentrifier is another rock club. Northsix was a pioneer when it opened in Williamsburg six years ago, and has been an important incubator for the Brooklyn scene; it will close after this week's shows for renovations by its new owners, the proprietors of the Bowery Ballroom and the Mercury Lounge, and reopen later this year as the Music Hall of Williamsburg. Tonight features a solo set by Ted Leo, a veteran pop-punk bandleader who is one of the best songwriters in the game, and on Wednesday is Radio 4, which emulates the frantic punk-funk of early-'80s British bands like Gang of Four and Public Image Limited. At 9, 66 North Sixth Street, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15; $13 in advance for Wednesday's show. (Sisario) PAOLO NUTINI (Wednesday) A Scottish heartthrob who just turned 20, Mr. Nutini has already conquered the British charts with snappy, vaguely racy tunes like ''Jenny Don't Be Hasty,'' about an affair with an, ahem, older woman. (She's 23, he's 18.) He begins a coordinated American invasion next week, with the release of his debut album, ''These Streets'' (Atlantic), and appearances on ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and the ''Today'' show. With Musiq Soulchild. At 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) O'DEATH, T K WEBB (Wednesday and Thursday) O'Death draws from the starkness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the menace of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits, jumbling sacred and profane. A Brooklynite by way of rural Missouri, the singer and guitarist T K Webb plays ragged, stark Delta blues about desolation and dying young, surrounding his creaky tenor with a halo of eerie reverb. Wednesday At 7 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $8. Mr. Webb also plays on Thursday at 8 p.m., with Shortstack and These United States, at Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $6. (Sisario) ANDERS PARKER (Wednesday) Mr. Parker, who led the band Varnaline, immerses his songs in the stoic drama of country and folk music, resulting in a melancholy that is sometimes indistinguishable from cynicism. (''The hours I've wasted here I could have wasted anywhere.'') At 9 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) PETER, BJORN AND JOHN (Monday and Tuesday) The latest sharp and impeccably stylish import from Sweden, this trio sets breathy, heavy-hearted vocals over spare but peppery band arrangements that recall 1960s folk-pop.

(Sisario) SUNBURNED HAND OF THE MAN (Sunday and Monday) Improvisation means lots of things in rock, but to this Massachusetts collective, which has been churning out dozens of albums and homemade recordings since the mid-'90s, it means spacey, meandering drones that seem like endless psychedelic trips.

WARD (Tonight) Ubiquitous as a sideman for indie-rock royalty -- Cat Power, Bright Eyes, Beth Orton, Jenny Lewis -- M. Ward stepped into the fore last year with an extraordinary solo album, ''Post-War'' (Merge). Over scratchy, portentous acoustic blues, he sings of malaise and loss in a dry, spectral voice: ''He was a good man but now he's gone,'' goes a deadpan requiem for a soldier. With Portastatic.

(Holland) * 'IL SIGNOR BRUSCHINO' (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) Mention Rossini, and most people come up with ''The Barber of Seville,'' but this work -- in which the composer honed the comic gift that came to the fore in ''Barber'' and other opera buffe -- hasn't been staged in New York since 1933. The Gotham Chamber Opera has set itself apart among the city's small opera companies with quality performances of lesser-known operas (with good singers), conducted by the company's founder, Neal Goren. Robin Guarino directs the company's performance of this frothy piece of fun.

The other news is the promising performance of an artist who, like Ms. Hong, is from South Korea: the tenor Wookyung Kim, singing Alfredo in his Met debut season. As a Verdi tenor, Mr. Kim is a little green, but he has an appealing and robust voice, and at his best, sings with ardor and flair. The baritone Charles Taylor, who was ill on opening night, sings Germont. Carlo Rizzi conducts.

Mr. Morrison's contribution is a fast-cut montage of antique films, in which bubbles and other signs of decay create patterns as crucial to the work as the images of cowboys, flappers, factory workers, dancers, parachutists and the exotic Middle East and North Africa. Mr. Gordon's powerful 65-minute score -- played by an orchestra deployed in the balconies -- evolves from a faint, metallic rattle to a barrage of percussion, electric guitars, brass choirs, woodwinds and strings. At 7 and 9:30, Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101; $25.

The program also includes Britten's ''Lachrymae,'' based on a song by John Dowland (which Britten initially wrote for piano and viola and later arranged for orchestra), and Schnittke's ''Monologue.'' At 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $75. (Schweitzer) * 'MOZART AT 251' (Tomorrow) For years, Uri Caine, a jazz player and musical polyglot, has intelligently deconstructed music by classical composers with a blend that might include jazz, bossa nova, klezmer and tango. Having already reimagined Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations and Beethoven's ''Diabelli'' Variations, he now turns to Mozart. The program opens with a ''pure'' reading of Mozart's Divertimento in E flat (K. 563), by the cellist Matt Haimovitz, the violinist Jonathan Crow and the violist Douglas McNabney. Then Mr. Haimovitz will join Mr. Caine, the clarinetist Chris Speed, the bassist Drew Gress and others for a renegade Mozartian jam session.

His first of two programs last week was predictably distinguished.

This 1886 concerto was taken up by noted conductors, including Mahler and Toscanini. Gerhard Oppitz will be the soloist. Mr. Muti will also conduct ''Feste Romane'' by Ottorino Respighi, who was a composition student of Martucci's, and the ballet music from Verdi's ''Macbeth.''

The program also includes Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra and Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 25 in C (K. 503), with the pianist Pedja Muzijevic.

Beginning Sunday, he performs the first of three Beethoven sonata programs at Lincoln Center. The opener offers two well-known sonatas, the ''Pathétique'' and the ''Appassionata,'' along with two inventive, bracing early sonatas, No. 6 in F and No. 11 in B flat. The latter is a score the composer was especially pleased with. At 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $50. (Tommasini) ST. LAWRENCE STRING QUARTET (Monday) This energetic Canadian quartet helped open the Baryshnikov Arts Center last season and returns to that loftlike space to play works including Schumann's Quartet Op. 41, No. 2, and Shostakovich's searing Quartet No. 8.

The wide-ranging program includes the world premieres of two pieces the foundation commissioned from Gabriela Lena Frank, as well as songs by Brahms, Vaughn Williams, Dvorak and Turina. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $37 and $45.

(Dunning) MUSIC AND DANCE OF WEST AFRICA (Tomorrow) The program features the polyphonic drumming and dancing of the Wolof people of Senegal, performed by the Sing Sing Rhythms and the Fula Flute Ensemble. At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, worldmusicinstitute.org; $27; $15 for students. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The company is getting the jump on a spring-season celebration of Lincoln Kirstein with ''Tribute to Kirstein'' tomorrow and Wednesday nights. It was Kirstein who made City Ballet happen by coaxing George Balanchine to the United States. The program includes ''Episodes,'' ''Vienna Waltzes'' and a piece by Christopher d'Amboise. Other programs for the week include ''Tradition and Innovation'' (''Mozartiana,'' ''In Vento'' and Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 2) tonight; ''Stravinsky and Balanchine: an Eternal Partnership'' (''Agon,'' ''Monumentum pro Gesualdo,'' ''Movements for Piano and Orchestra,'' ''Duo Concertant'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements'') on Sunday; and ''Essential Balanchine'' (''Square Dance,'' ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' and ''Stars and Stripes'') on Tuesday and Thursday.

(Dunning) LAURA PETERSON CHOREOGRAPHY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Peterson, who has danced with everyone from Risa Jaroslow to Poppo and the GoGo Boys, describes her new ''I Love Dan Flavin'' as a tongue-in-cheek futuristic dance with fluorescent light and pioneering techno music. At 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, Ext. 11, dixonplace.org; $15 or T.D.F. vouchers; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning) PHILADANCO (Sunday) This veteran modern-dance company is known for its high-powered performing and choice repertory of work by black choreographers. At 3 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, lehmancenter.org; $20 to $35. (Dunning) RAGAMALA MUSIC AND DANCE THEATER (Tomorrow) The company will perform ''From Temple to Theater,'' which includes both traditional Bharata Natyam dances and contemporary choreography. At 7:30 p.m., Colden Auditorium, Kupferberg Center for the Arts, Queens College, Kissena Boulevard and the Long Island Expressway, Flushing, (718) 793-8080, kuperferbergcenter.org; $12. (Dunning) * TAMAR ROGOFF'S 'EDITH & JENNY' (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Rogoff's piece alludes to the childhood friendship of her daughter, Ariel Rogoff Flavin, and Claire Danes, who trained in dance before becoming a film actress, as well as roles each played as 11-year-olds in films by Jeff Mueller. (Through Feb. 4.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 5 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288, ps122.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+.

(Dunning) TAKE DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Takehiro Ueyama, a former Paul Taylor dancer, is becoming known for gutsy, well-plotted dances, here set to music by composers and groups that include Bach, Arvo Pärt and the Southern All Stars. (Through Feb. 4.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Art Fairs 53RD ANNUAL WINTER ANTIQUES SHOW, through Sunday. Mature is the word in the trade for fairs like the Winter Antiques Show, though time-honored, even venerable, would be closer to the mark. The show has been around forever (well, since 1955). It delivers substantial, sometimes spectacular, retail. Dealers and clients alike return, like swallows to Capistrano, year after year. So if solid tradition, rather than Basel-Miami-style blowouts, is what you want in a fair, this one's for you. Seventh Regiment Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (718) 292-7392. (Holland Cotter) Museums * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON'S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,' through April 29. This show has more than 300 of the prints Henri Cartier-Bresson glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It's an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. Here are the familiar, and, more interestingly, some less familiar, shots of crowds in Hyde Park in London at George VI's coronation, of picnickers on the banks of the Marne in France and whores in Valencia, Spain. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Kimmelman) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'MARTIN MUNKACSI: THINK WHILE YOU SHOOT!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,' through Feb. 19. The 100 paintings and drawings on display here are by 10 artists, including George Grosz, Christian Schad, and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble; we look into the faces of museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92) portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and Continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DOUG AITKEN: SLEEPWALKERS,' through Feb. 12. Produced in concert with Creative Time Inc., this monumental video projection, screened nightly (from 5 to 10) on three sides of the sleek exterior of the newly expanded Museum of Modern Art, consists of short, silent and rather too glamorous meditations on the working nights of five emblematic New Yorkers played somnolently by musicians and actors who include Donald Sutherland and Tilda Swinton. But Mr. Aitken's astute and restless cinematic ambition and commanding sense of scale are in full force, especially in the more abstract portions of the piece, resulting in a fitting ode to the city that never sleeps and that the camera has always loved. (212) 708-9400, daily. (Smith) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'KIKI SMITH: A GATHERING, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * ROBERT IRWIN: 'WHO'S AFRAID OF RED, YELLOW AND BLUE 3' In the past, Robert Irwin has paid homage to Joseph Albers. Now he makes a bow to a different kind of perceptual magician, Barnett Newman, turning Newman's 1966-70 paintings titled ''Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue'' into a kind of self-reflective architecture. Optical illusionism has long been Mr. Irwin's calling card, but here he has achieved it by bare-bones means, offering quieting visual fare for an overstimulated world. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-4258, pacewildenstein.com, through Feb. 3 . (Cotter) * PORTIA MUNSON: GREEN On the floor, all manner of discarded plastic objects and cheap toys coalesce into a dense scatter piece that commemorates the fall of nature, the rise of suburbia and the varied tonalities of indigenous if artificial green. On the walls, exquisite mille-fleur-like color photographs made on a scanner redirect set-up photography back toward the experimental nature prints and photogenic drawings of the 19th century. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, (212) 647-1043, through Feb. 3. (Smith) Last Chance * BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'TROPICALIA: A REVOLUTION IN BRAZILIAN CULTURE,' Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sun shower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'TIGERS OF WRATH: WATERCOLORS BY WALTON FORD,' This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, produced since the early '90s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to. Though they're wonderfully lucid and dramatic, the moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this popular artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Benjamin Genocchio) * 'THE CONSTANT POSSIBILITY OF ERASURE' Organized by Donna Harkavy and Gracie Mansion, this excellent group show is at once witty and elegaic, exploring transience as an existential reality and as a conceptual ploy in late-20th-century art. Robert Rauschenberg's 1953 ''Erased de Kooning'' is an important reference point, present through Mike Bidlo's painstaking recreation. Joseph Beuys, Gary Simmons and Christian Xarec all have chalk pieces on blackboards, while Allan Kaprow preferred drawing, and simultaneously erasing, chalk pictures on the sidewalks or streets. Joanne Stamerra Hendricks uses erasers as a medium, and Jim Dingilian uses smoke. Dorsky Gallery Curatorial Projects, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-6317; closes on Monday. (Cotter) * 'THE EARLY WORK OF WILLIAM KING' The spindly figure sculptures by William King that we know best have arms like I-beams, legs like stilts, and heads that are barely there. But his early work looks quite different, and that's the revelation of this absorbing show, assembled by the art critic Sanford Schwartz at Alexandre Gallery. Much of the material is hand-size or toy-size and comes in a variety of forms and media, and most of it is being exhibited for the first time. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Velázquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbarán and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. Extending John Berger's famous title, the show might be called ''Ways of Seeing Paintings.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; closes on Sunday. (Smith) THE MET: 'AMERICANS IN PARIS: 1860-1900,' The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition that goes a little way toward reversing the fall season's trend of big, surveyish shows made up of splashy objects and bland ideas. In this case, the basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,' This gripping show reminds us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org; closes on Monday. (Cotter) NEWARK MUSEUM, THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'MASTERS OF AMERICAN COMICS' Organized by the Hammer Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it made a splash, this show has come east, cut in size and split between the far-flung Newark and Jewish museums, in which it looks cramped. Art Spiegelman, one of the masters who helped instigate the exhibition, felt so aggrieved by the circumstances that at nearly the 11th hour he pulled his work. This was a pity, for the obvious reasons, and also because the Jewish Museum scrambled to fill the gap he left by appending a half-baked display of superhero comic artists. Still, the show shouldn't be missed. It spotlights artists like Chris Ware and Gary Panter, amazing talents and endearing in the tradition of those shy, gifted kids who drew endlessly in their roomswhen other kids wouldn't play with them, dreaming about someday telling the world, ''I told you so.'' Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street, (973) 596-6550, newarkmuseum.org; and the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman) P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'MUSIC IS A BETTER NOISE' An involvement of some sort with music is the main criterion for this disparate but engaging show. The artist-musicians on hand include Jutta Koether, the rapper Rammellzee, Don Van Vliet (a k a Captain Beefheart) and Devendra Banhart. Chuck Naney contributes a beautiful sound-light installation in the stairwell, and Rodney Graham tries his hand at music video. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday. (Smith) RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; closes on Monday. (Cotter) THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PICASSO AND AMERICAN ART,' Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. The show ends not with the lively question of Picasso's impact on young artists today but with a virtual retrospective of the later, Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him; closes on Sunday. (See above.)

Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:45). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of José Saramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jonathan Kalb) 'CHICKEN' Michael Batistick's new play about cock fighting and emasculation could benefit from subtler metaphors but manages to touch us gently even as it deploys a heavy hammer. E J Carroll, Michael Imperioli and his ''Sopranos'' castmate Sharon Angela give fine performances as struggling urban nobodies (1:45). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Ginia Bellafante) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FUGUE' ''Mary Smith'' is found wandering the streets of Chicago, suffering from amnesia. A young psychiatrist, who has his own demons, is consulted, and the process of treatment and Mary's memories in flashback are the action of ''Fugue,'' Lee Thuna's unrewarding play, directed by the Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey (2:15). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) * 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood) 'LOS ANGELES' Julian Sheppard's play about a gamin lost in a Hollywood of aimlessness and empty sex is as thin as the slip dress she keeps wearing and, presumably, taking off (1:20). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'OUR LEADING LADY' Kate Mulgrew stars as Laura Keene, who was starring in ''Our American Cousin'' the night Lincoln was shot, in Charles Busch's uneven new comedy. An occasionally lively but mostly lumpen tribute to the glamour and grit of the theatrical life of a past era (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'PROMETHEUS BOUND' With a splendid performance by David Oyelowo, this is a smart revival of Aeschylus' 2,500-year-old play, rich in poetic imagery. It still has things to say about the abuse of power by an autocratic ruler who vindictively runs roughshod over anyone who disagrees with him (1:20). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'SOME MEN' Terrence McNally's hit-and-miss comedy about gay life is a parade of cleanly drawn types, zippy one-liners and sentimental set pieces, woven into a pageant of the ages à la ''Cavalcade,'' Noel Coward's generations-spanning tribute to the British stiff upper lip. Trip Cullman directs the agile, appealing cast (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'TALL GRASS' Brian Harris's three short plays, black farces all, are not nearly as slight as any sound-bite synopsis would have them seem. Here Mr. Harris, a former stock analyst, explores the alliances formed between love and brutality in scenarios in which the tension builds to culminating shock (1:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'TEA AND SYMPATHY' The specter of the Ted Haggard scandal hangs over the Keen Company's revival of Robert Anderson's 1953 play about life in a psychologically stifling boys' boarding school. Girded by Jonathan Silverstein's skillful, understated direction, the play attains an unexpected timeliness as it evolves into a story about the dangers of sexual repression (2:00). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) 'WIDOWERS' HOUSES' An adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play, updated to 1990s Harlem, tests the limits of credibility (1:40). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) Off Off Broadway 'THE EXILES' Theodora Skipitares's rendering, with life-size puppets, music and video, of the story of Orestes, adapted from Euripides but inspired by Sartre. A short and rather slight play that continues the mining of the Trojan War for contemporary equivalents by the conceiver and director of last season's Trilogy (1:00). La MaMa Annex, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Moore) 'JACKIE WITH A Z': Delectably outrageous (1:30). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'MEN OF STEEL' This darkly comic twist on superheroes is a loony, guilty pleasure (2:00). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE DIRECTOR' A likable if naïve young woman, who is seduced by an unnamed, unseen and presumably unscrupulous film director, seeks other of his victims and tape records their experiences for no clear purpose in a play that has no clear idea of what it wants to say (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' A joyful treat (1:30). JCC in Manhattan, Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Van Gelder) * 'THE TAMING OF THE SHREW' AND 'TWELFTH NIGHT' In these boisterous and inventive productions, from the London-based all-male Propeller Company, the poetry may be pretty, but the comedy definitely is not. The director Edward Hall uncovers the baleful underbelly in Shakespearean slapstick, memorably demonstrating that boys will be brutes. (Each is 2:40.) Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE WAITING ROOM' An amusing play about some uncomfortable truths a group of friends and relatives faces while sitting in a hospital waiting room. While it has its share of laughs, it has things to say about the importance of family, even those members you might wish were not a part of it (2:00). 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Hampton) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AIR GUITAR NATION' (R, 82 minutes) Alexandra Lipsitz's breezy competition documentary follows pantomiming would-be rockers as they compete for the right to represent their country in a global championship based in Oulou, Finland. The movement, such as it is, aims to unite a war-torn planet in musical fantasy and to rawwwwwwk! -- but not necessarily in that order. Stylistically, it's nothing special, but the film's droll humor and wild performances are hard to resist. (Matt Zoller Seitz) * 'BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON' (R, 92 minutes) Scott Glosserman's mockumentary about a celebrity-seeking serial killer is sustained by rapier-sharp observations and a firmer grasp of tone than that in many more generously financed projects. Appealing more to the brain than to the gut, the movie subtly prods at the sick dance between the news media and über-criminals without belaboring its point or lowering its tone. If Christopher Guest ever turned his attention to psycho killers instead of folk singers and dog breeders, this is exactly the sort of movie he would make. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'BOY CULTURE' (No rating, 88 minutes) Q. Allan Brocka's absorbing drama follows an emotionally repressed gay hustler (Derek Magyar) as he rebels against the obsessions of his culture -- grooming, cruising, working out -- and a powerful attraction to his roommate. Only when he takes on a reclusive and much older client is he forced to pay attention to a story other than his own. (Catsoulis) 'COLOR ME KUBRICK' (No rating, 90 minutes) If it doesn't add up to more than a fitfully amusing collection of comic sketches, the fictional portrait of Alan Conway, a real-life British con man who hustled his way across England by impersonating the reclusive filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, is a platform for John Malkovich to burst into lurid purple flame. (Stephen Holden) 'DEAD SILENCE' (R, 90 minutes) In this new film from the makers of the ''Saw'' series, a young man (Ryan Kwanten) whose wife was murdered by a demonic ventriloquist's dummy returns to his hometown to unravel the roots of a century-old curse. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies. (Seitz) 'EXTERMINATING ANGELS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in French) The French director Jean-Claude Brisseau's film is a piece of highbrow smut about a French filmmaker directing a piece of highbrow smut. A must for fans of highbrow smut. No complaints here. (A. O. Scott) 'FIRST SNOW' (R, 101 minutes) Guy Pearce, in his ''Memento'' mode, is a fast-talking salesman in this moody little thriller, which asks metaphysical questions about fate, death and fortunetelling. (Holden) 'THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2' (R, 89 minutes) Wes Craven's 1977 film, ''The Hills Have Eyes,'' in which suburbanites battled mutant cannibals, was a pulpy parable of the thin line separating civilization from savagery. Last year's remake was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up, in which National Guard trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout, is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video. (Seitz) * 'THE HOST' (R, 119 minutes, in Korean) A loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid -- part carnival of horrors, part family melodrama -- about the demons that haunt us from without and within. The talented South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho directs his monster and humans with equal flair. (Manohla Dargis) 'I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE' (R, 94 minutes) An unusually smart and brisk comedy of marital frustration and sexual temptation, based on Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon,'' with Chris Rock (who directed and is co-author of the script) as a Manhattan investment banker distracted by the charms of a bombshell played by the wonderful Kerry Washington. (Scott) * 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' (No rating, 162 minutes, in English and Latin) Philip Gröning's documentary about the lives of Carthusian monks living in a valley in the French Alps is slow, quiet and utterly spellbinding for the way it conveys the experience of spiritual devotion in simple, lovely images. (Scott) * 'JOURNEY FROM THE FALL' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Vietnamese and English) The writer and director Ham Tran's film is a sprawling tearjerker about a war-splintered South Vietnamese family trying to survive the aftermath of the United States withdrawal, then seek a new life in America. Set amid the chaos of late-'70s Vietnam, when the victorious North set about ''re-educating'' the shattered South, ''Journey'' recounts one family's endurance in a sturdy, old-movie style, with sweeping camerawork, a monumental and occasionally intrusive orchestral score, gorgeous yet forbidding natural vistas and enough shocking tragedies, brazen escapes and crowd-pleasing acts of defiance to fuel several action-adventure pictures. (Seitz) 'THE LAST MIMZY' (PG, 94 minutes) This overstuffed yet warmhearted sci-fi drama follows a pair of wide-eyed siblings as they solve the riddle of a box from the future. Despite leaden direction (by the New Line Cinema honcho Robert Shaye) and a story crammed with pseudoscientific flotsam -- including palm reading, levitation and telepathy -- this wholesome entertainment doesn't talk down. Nevertheless, a film gazing this far into the future shouldn't be quite so unwilling to look beyond the frame. (Catsoulis) * 'OFFSIDE' (PG, 93 minutes, in Persian) The Iranian director Jafar Panahi follows a group of young woman into a Tehran soccer stadium, where they have come to see their nation's team compete for a spot in the World Cup. Instead they are arrested -- women are forbidden to attend sporting events in Iran -- and their predicament yields comedy as well as a trenchant critique of gender politics in the Islamic Republic. (Scott) 'THE PAGE TURNER' (No rating, 85 minutes, in French) A pretty young thing slithers into the bosom of a bourgeois family like an asp in this shivery little thriller from the French filmmaker Denis Dercourt. Not Chabrol, but not bad, either. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE' (PG, 104 minutes) The Zimbabwean-born filmmaker Sunu Gonera's directorial debut, ''Pride,'' about a swim coach (Terrence Howard, star of ''Hustle & Flow'') leading an urban recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of ''I'll Take You There,'' the heart still swells. (Seitz) 'THE PRISONER OR: HOW I PLANNED TO KILL TONY BLAIR' (PG-13, 72 minutes) In 2003 an Iraqi journalist, Yunis Khatayer Abbas, was roused from his Baghdad bed by American soldiers and eventually hauled off to Abu Ghraib. Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein tell his story through newsy video images, talking-head interviews, comic-book-style illustrations and a sympathetic lens. (Dargis) 'REIGN OVER ME' (R, 124 minutes) Mike Binder's comic drama of post-9/11 grief is wildly uneven -- by turns insightful and grindingly mawkish. Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler are two college buddies who reunite, somewhat improbably, some years after the attacks that robbed one of them of his family. The actors rise above the material, particularly in the longer, looser scenes that allow their contrasting temperaments -- Mr. Cheadle's tense understatement and Mr. Sandler's shaggy emoting -- to find a workable syncopation. (Scott) 'SHOOTER' (R, 126 minutes) Muscles bulge, and heads explode in this thoroughly reprehensible, satisfyingly violent entertainment about men and guns and things that go boom. Antoine Fuqua directs, and Mark Wahlberg entertains, with and without his shirt. (Dargis) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'TMNT' (PG, 90 minutes) Spawned by sludge and grandiosely named after Renaissance artists, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been rechristened ''TMNT'' and redrawn by an army of computer-generated-imagery specialists. A strange blend of the futuristic and the ancient, this fourth outing finds them hunting 3,000-year-old monsters. But while the turtles may look prettier, they are no smarter; our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof. (Catsoulis) * 'THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY' (No rating, 127 minutes) Stringent, serious history from Ken Loach, in which the Irish uprising and Civil War of the early 1920s test the loyalties and consciences of two brothers, played by Cillian Murphy and Padraic Delany. (Scott) * 'ZODIAC' (R, 158 minutes) David Fincher's magnificently obsessive new film tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the '70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, ''Zodiac'' is part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts. (Dargis) Film Series NEW DIRECTORS/NEW FILMS (Tonight through Thursday) Now in its second and final week, this 36th annual installment of a festival devoted to ''emerging'' filmmakers and sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art continues at MoMA and the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. Highlights this week: ''The Great World of Sound'' (tonight at MoMA, tomorrow and Sunday at Walter Reade), Craig Zobel's satire about the industry that has grown up to feed contestants to reality shows like ''American Idol''; ''Day Night Day Night,'' a new film by the New York filmmaker Julia Loktev (''Moment of Impact'') that follows a nameless girl around Manhattan as she prepares for her mission as a suicide bomber (tonight at Walter Reade, tomorrow at MoMA); ''The Other Half,'' a Chinese film directed by Ying Liang, in which an ambitious young businesswoman's life is complicated by her aggressively antisocial boyfriend (tomorrow at Walter Reade, Sunday at MoMA). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $12. (Dave Kehr) 'SEVERANCE' (Monday) For their ''Bizarro Mondays'' program at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater in the East Village, the editors of the horror fan magazine Fangoria this week have chosen Christopher Smith's 2006 ''Severance,'' a British film that seems to have been conceived as a cross between ''The Office'' and ''Hostel.'' A group of disgruntled employees of an international arms company are invited for a weekend retreat at a lodge in the Balkans, but fall into the sadistic hands of a group of crazed, sadistic veterans of the recent conflicts. Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village, (212) 591-0434, twoboots.com/pioneer; $10. (Kehr) JACQUES TATI RETROSPECTIVE (Tuesday) Two of the more rarely screened films of this brilliant French comic filmmaker. First is the recently rediscovered and restored color version of Tati's first feature, the 1949 ''Jour de Fête,'' in which a provincial postman (Tati) tries to apply American efficiency methods; it's followed by ''Trafic,'' the 1971 film that Tati made partly to recover the huge financial losses of his masterpiece ''Playtime.'' For Tati, it's relatively conventional, but still quite an innovative and entertaining work. French Institute-Alliance Française, Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6100, fiaf .org; $9. (Kehr) 'UGETSU' (Tonight through Sunday) This yearlong program of 35-millimeter prints from the Janus Films collection continues with noontime screenings of Kenji Mizoguchi's eerie 1953 ghost story of a peasant potter whose path through the civil wars of 16th-century Japan leads him to the estate of a mysterious noblewoman, who is not what she seems. After ''Roshomon,'' this was one of the first Japanese films to gain a reputation in the West, and it remains a transcendent masterpiece. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. CHRISTINA AGUILERA, PUSSYCAT DOLLS, DANITY KANE (Thursday) Frau Farbissina of the ''Austin Powers'' movies said it best: ''Send in the Fembots!'' Ms. Aguilera may have the most virtuosic voice of her generation of bubble gum pop stars, but as she showed with her endless, melismatic protraction of James Brown's ''It's a Man's Man's Man's World'' at the Grammys last month, she can sometimes seem like a singing robot gone berserk. Her tour includes a hit burlesque girl group (the Pussycat Dolls) and an imitation hit burlesque girl group (Danity Kane). At 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $57 and $97. (Ben Sisario) HOSSEIN ALIZADEH AND THE Hamavayan Ensemble (Tomorrow) One of the most celebrated Iranian classical musicians, Mr. Alizadeh is a former conductor and soloist with the Iranian National Orchestra of Radio and Television. Here he plays shurangiz and setar, two kinds of lute, and leads the Hamavayan Ensemble in improvisations and his own compositions. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Jon Pareles) * ALLMAN BROTHERS (Tonight, tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights) The best spring ritual on the Upper West Side is the arrival of this archetypal Southern rock band for its annual series of concerts at the Beacon Theater. In addition to the long, long guitar solos by Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, highlights usually include lots of guest stars. At 8, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $54.99 to $94.99. (Sisario) ANTI-SOCIAL MUSIC (Wednesday) The final frontier for weird rock is classical music. Anti-Social Music, a collective of 11 New York musicians who play in various pop and new-music bands -- including some big ones, like the Hold Steady -- is one of a handful of groups that go boldly into this realm, playing works for strings, woodwinds and the like. Skeptics, note: it can get pretty rowdy. With Capital M. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $10. (Sisario) BLACK DICE (Wednesday) Noise, noise, glorious New York noise. Black Dice, from Brooklyn, is a big player in the international avant-rock scene, and has remained vital by staying truly experimental: whether playing spacey, hokey psychedelia or alien-invasion squalls of feedback, the band throws itself deeply into its every unpredictable turn. With Ocrilim and No Age. At 8 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com or toddpnyc.com; $8. (Sisario) * BLOC PARTY, ALBERT HAMMOND JR. (Tonight and tomorrow night) With spiky but melodic guitars and agitated dance beats, Bloc Party revives the nervous punk-funk of bands like Gang of Four. Its latest, ''A Weekend in the City'' (Vice), is a concept album about life in London after the 2005 transit bombings. Albert Hammond Jr., the rhythm guitarist of the Strokes, has a new solo record, ''Yours to Keep'' (Scratchie/New Line), whose sunshine shows that crisp guitar classicism need not exist solely in the dark behind Manhattan's velvet ropes. With Sebastien Grainger. At 8, United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171, bowerypresents.com; sold out.

(Sisario) BLOOD BROTHERS (Monday) Proving once again rock's inexhaustible lesson that loudness equals liberation, the Blood Brothers, from Seattle, are a five-man weapon of frantic noise and surrealist poetry. (''Set fire to the face on fire.'') With Celebration and Chinese Stars. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $17. (Sisario) THE BOOKS (Tonight) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of disembodied vocal samples, a few notes from a banjo and unclassifiable sounds that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening is trying to figure out just why all this chaos works so wonderfully and wittily. At 7, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; free with museum admission. (Sisario) Barbara Carroll (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) * TOUMANI DIABATÉ'S SYMMETRIC ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Mr. Diabaté, the Malian kora master, plays regular gigs back home in Bamako with this 30-odd-piece big band, mixing ancient songs with salsa-infused funk. Last year he made an excellent album with this group, ''Boulevard de l'Indépendance'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch), and he leads it in its New York debut tonight at 10, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Sisario) DIPLO, BONDE DO ROLE (Tonight) Diplo, born Wesley Pentz -- his stage name is taken from diplodocus, a dinosaur -- is the influential and eclectic D.J. who has worked with the Sri Lankan-British rapper M.I.A., and is half of Hollertronix, a mixtape team from Philadelphia. He has been borrowing from Brazilian baile funk for years, and the first release on his new record label, Mad Descent, is by the Brazilian group Bonde do Role. At 10, Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $12. (Sisario) DR. DOG, O'DEATH (Thursday) Dr. Dog, from Philadelphia, takes a jam-band approach to high-energy rhapsodies that recall ''Abbey Road''-era Beatles. The New York band O'Death draws from the bluntness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the menace of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits, jumbling sacred and profane. With Doublehorse. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door.

(Sisario) HEAVEN AND HELL (Tonight) Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio in place of Ozzy Osbourne. Again. Which means it's effectively 1980 and not very exciting. Again. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $54 to $74. (Sisario) HELLA, DIRTY PROJECTORS (Tonight and tomorrow night) It's impossible to find the center of a Hella song, which explodes in multidirectional streaks of percussion and squawky guitar like a Jackson Pollock painting. Long a guitar-drum duo, the group recently expanded to five members. Dirty Projectors, led by Dave Longstreth, builds elaborate ''glitch operas'' with stark pluckings of guitar and strings, and precise, ecstatic harmonies, all arranged slightly out of whack. Tonight at 9, Europa, 98-104 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $12. Tomorrow at 7, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $12. (Sisario) JET (Thursday) Determined to boil rock down to its AC/DC-meets-Guns-N'-Roses essence, this Australian band dismisses anything that distracts from that goal -- including innovation. With the Virgins. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $28 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) CHRIS KNIGHT (Thursday) Cold-eyed drifters, crooked yet sentimental cops, and prostitutes who kill their johns are characters in the brutal, deadpan songs of Chris Knight, a country singer from Kentucky whose oeuvre resembles Bruce Springsteen's album ''Nebraska'' set in the South. At 8 p.m., Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) LAND OF TALK (Tuesday through Thursday) Riding a wave of blog buzz, this young Montreal band, recalling Dinosaur Jr. and P J Harvey with tangles of grungy guitar and opaque but affecting lyrics, makes a sweep through the clubs. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $10. Wednesday at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $8. Thursday at 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario) * LCD SOUNDSYSTEM (Tonight and tomorrow night) Tim Murphy's perfect, punk-edged disco in LCD Soundsystem -- sharp and sexy but unapologetically silly, retro but smartly innovative -- has roots across the dance-rock map but is unmistakably a product of New York. (''Those of you who still think we're from England/We're not,'' he sings with nasal congestion and typical wryness on ''North American Scum.'') The group celebrates a brilliant new album, ''Sound of Silver'' (Capitol), with two shows at the Bowery Ballroom. At 9, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) Marilyn Maye (Tomorrow and Sunday) This too-seldom-seen jazz belter, now in her mid-'70s, folds Anita O'Day-style swing and chesty Margaret Whiting-like belting into a musical jelly roll with a bittersweet Judy Garland filling. Tomorrow at 7 and 10:30 p.m., Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m., Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden) PAGE McCONNELL (Wednesday) This former keyboardist of Phish offers a preview of his first solo album, to be released next month. At 8 p.m., Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) 'THE MUSIC OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN' (Thursday) Like the Bob Dylan tribute at Lincoln Center a few months ago, this concert, a benefit for the Music for Youth Foundation, gathers a starry group: Steve Earle, Jewel, M. Ward, Josh Ritter, Joseph Arthur, Badly Drawn Boy, Juliana Hatfield, the Holmes Brothers, Elysian Fields, Uri Caine, Odetta and Ronnie Spector, among others. Mr. Dylan didn't show up at his tribute. Will Bruce Springsteen? At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $150. (Sisario) LES NUBIANS (Sunday) The French tried but failed to smooth out African music completely. Les Nubians, two sisters from Cameroon, harmonize in cosmopolitan rhythm-and-blues that Erykah Badu fans would appreciate; they move among smooth soul crooning à la Sade, rapping in French and hints of both American funk and Cameroonian traditions. At 8 and 10 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $26 in advance, $28 at the door (sold out at 8). (Pareles) PERE UBU (Tuesday) In the mid-'70s, while bands like the Dead Boys and the Ramones were perfecting the narrow sonic attack that came to be known as punk, Pere Ubu, from Cleveland, was playing a dissonant, urgent and deeply idiosyncratic variation centered on the sung-spoken vocals of David Thomas. With Golden Error and Beat the Devil. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) SIN-É (Tonight through Sunday) It's never easy to see a good New York rock club go down, but it's especially painful when it happens to the same place twice. In the late 1980s and early '90s, Sin-é, on St. Marks Place in the East Village, was a cozy coffeehouse frequented by singer-songwriters like Jeff Buckley; its new home on the Lower East Side will be shutting down after Sunday night. Tonight is the singer-songwriter Citizen Cope, whose bluesy drawl is delivered over leisurely hip-hop rhythms. Tomorrow night is a standard Sin-é lineup, with four indie-rock bands presented by their record label, Eyeball: Kiss Kiss, New London Fire, the Velocet and the Anthem Sound. Sunday is the country-rocker Bow Thayer. Tonight at 8 and 11, tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday night at 10, 150 Attorney Street, at Stanton Street, (212) 388-0077, sin-e.com; $20 tonight (sold out at 11), $10 tomorrow, $12 on Sunday. (Sisario) * SONS AND DAUGHTERS (Wednesday) With bleak scrapings of guitar, smoldering rhythms and lyrics of unforgiving fate delivered by the petite but wicked Adele Bethel, this Glasgow band has perfected its own kind of chilling murder ballad. With 1990s, and Nicole Atkins and the Sea. At 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) DOC WATSON (Tonight) One of the great repositories of American folk music, the guitarist and singer Doc Watson, from Deep Gap, N.C., plays bluegrass, country and blues in an elegant but understated style. On this tour he is joined by the storyteller David Holt. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $37.

(Nate Chinen) DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Thursday) As the name implies, this big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a sound equally suggestive of Steve Reich minimalism, harmonically advanced indie rock and orchestral jazz in the Bob Brookmeyer descent. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12; $10 for members.

Her partners here are the engagingly prickly guitarist Nels Cline and the polymorphically propulsive drummer Jim Black.

Opera * 'DIE AGYPTISCHE HELENA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) With its convoluted libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and unevenly inspired score by Richard Strauss, this wry contemporary take on the Helen of Troy myth has remained a rarity since its 1928 premiere. But the Metropolitan Opera's fancifully surreal new production by David Fielding, mounted for the soprano Deborah Voigt, makes a compelling case for this intriguing work, thanks to Ms. Voigt's vocally lustrous and affecting portrayal of the title role, as well as the vibrant and insightful conducting of Fabio Luisi. The brilliant coloratura Diana Damrau is wonderful as the sorceress Aithra. The German tenor Torsten Kerl, who had to be replaced halfway through the performance on opening night, because of illness, is scheduled to sing Menelas for the remaining performances. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $120 to $220 tomorrow; $80 to $175 for Wednesday. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'ANDREA CHÉNIER' (Monday) The great Ben Heppner, arguably the leading Wagnerian tenor of our day, continues his bold explorations of far-flung repertory with the title role of Giordano's verismo opera, in the Met's revival of Nicolas Joël's 1996 production. Mr. Heppner may lack the vocal colorings and idiomatic expressivity of the heroic Italian tenors who excelled in this touchstone role. But in his compelling portrayal he sings with burnished sound, vigor and lyrical sensitivity. The rich-voiced soprano Violeta Urmana as Maddalena and the powerful baritone Mark Delavan as Gérard are very strong. Marco Armiliato conducts. Monday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini) 'La DONNA DEL LAGO' (Tonight, Sunday and Thursday) The New York City Opera continues its fruitful excavations of the bel canto repertory, this time with Rossini's wholly Italian take on Walter Scott's very Scottish original. Alexandrina Pendatchanska sings the part of Elena. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Bernard Holland) * 'FLAVIO' (Wednesday) The New York City Opera revives its successful production, directed by Chas Rader-Shieber, with sets by David Zinn.

At 7:30 p.m., New York City Opera, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Vivien Schweitzer) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) The City Opera offers Mark Lamos's spartan yet attractive production competently sung by Angela Maria Blasi and Raúl Melo. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Holland) METROPOLITAN OPERA NATIONAL COUNCIL GRAND FINALS/40TH ANNIVERSARY (Sunday and Tuesday) The Met goes from bottom to top this week: from 11 young unknowns, who have made their way through three rounds and past hundreds of other applicants in the National Council Auditions, to two of the opera world's biggest stars. Those singers, Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón, will be showcased in three acts from three operas: ''La Bohème,'' ''Manon'' and ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' in honor of the 40th anniversary of the Met's move to Lincoln Center. Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday at 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $150 on Sunday, $250 to $1,250 on Tuesday. (Anne Midgette) * 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' (Tomorrow) Lillian Groag avoids the topical updating that has become a Gilbert and Sullivan tradition and focuses on the work's own satirical targets, which range from Victorian British society to the conventions of Italian grand opera. Even so, her direction for this City Opera production is inventive and lively, as are the performances by a cast that includes Sarah Jane McMahon as Mabel, Matt Morgan as Frederic and Marc Kudisch as the Pirate King. Gerald Steichen conducts. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Allan Kozinn) 'TURANDOT' (Tonight and Thursday night) Andrea Gruber's singing is a matter of debate -- listeners tend to love her intense energy or hate her vocal unevenness -- but Puccini's ice princess Turandot is one of two roles that she indisputably owns these days (the other is Abigaille in ''Nabucco''). Her Calaf is Richard Margison, an equally controversial though less prominent Canadian tenor who has a very respectable voice; for many the draw will be Hei-Kyung Hong, generally a radiant Liu. Since the withdrawal of Richard Armstrong, Fabio Luisi is conducting tonight and Thursday's performances; after that it's Marco Armiliato. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $140 tonight, $15 to $110 for Thursday. (Midgette) Classical Music ACADEMY OF ST.

(Schweitzer) PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Sunday) The excellent adventures of this fine French pianist continue with a mini-history of the piano, beginning with Scarlatti and Bach and extending to Messiaen, Carter, Boulez, Stockhausen and Kurtag. There will be talk as well. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48.

They will be accompanied by Les Arts Florissants. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $56. (Schweitzer) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) A chamber orchestra crowds onto the intimate stage at Bargemusic this weekend to play a program that includes Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons,'' as well as two more of that prolific composer's works, the Concerto in B minor for Four Violins (RV 580) and the Concerto for Two Cellos (RV 531). Nestled amid all this Vivaldi is the premiere of a new work by Igor Raykhelson, commissioned by Bargemusic. On Thursday the violinist Chin Kim and the pianist David Oei play works by Stravinsky, Chausson, Respighi and Bizet as arranged by Waxman.

At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34 to $108. (Holland) BARBARA FRITTOLI (Sunday) Italian opera singers sometimes have an uneasy relationship with the recital stage. Barbara Frittoli, a frequent guest at the Metropolitan Opera (most recently in ''Così Fan Tutte''), will set out to disprove this notion in her New York recital debut, which draws heavily on opera composers, while adding a set of Schubert and melodies by Duparc. James Vaughan is the accompanist. At 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $48. (Midgette) * WOLFGANG HOLZMAIR and HERMINE HASELBÖCK (Tonight, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday) On the model of a ''Schubertiade'' -- a festival of Schubert's songs -- comes a ''Wolfiade,'' devoted to the songs of Hugo Wolf, with the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair. Tonight the second of this mini-festival's three free recitals at Weill Recital Hall features Wolf's ''Italienisches Liederbuch,'' with Mr. Holzmair and the mezzo-soprano Hermine Haselböck; the last, on Thursday, adds the soprano Susanna Phillips for a rarity, the complete ''Spanisches Liederbuch.'' Mr. Holzmair is also leading master classes at the Austrian Cultural Forum, at which six selected singers will work on refining Wolf songs (on Monday) for a concluding recital (on Wednesday). Tonight and Thursday night at 8, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall; Monday at 11 a.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan. Free, but reservations are required: (212) 319-5300 or acfny.org. (Midgette) * BLAIR McMILLEN (Wednesday) This young American pianist has the technique, musicianship and dynamism to play just about anything. On Wednesday he presents a recital of really new pieces, part of a three-concert series titled ''Music for the New Century: Works Composed Since 2000,'' presented by the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America at Columbia University. There will be pieces by Joan Tower, Steven Stucky, Marco Stroppa and others. At 8 p.m., Casa Italiana, Columbia University, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, between 116th and 118th Streets, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-1623; free, but reservations are recommended. (Tommasini) * MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight) During the concert season a select roster of artists from the prestigious summer Marlboro Music Festival tour America, including annual visits to New York. The next Musicians from Marlboro concert looks particularly enticing. The composer John Harbison's ''Twilight Music'' for horn, violin and piano is a worthy companion piece to Brahms's Trio in E flat (Op. 40), scored for the same unusual group of instruments. Those works frame this program, which also includes Ravel's String Quartet and Stravinsky's Concertino for String Quartet. At 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Tommasini) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) The fine Romanian pianist Radu Lupu joins Colin Davis in Mozart's supremely elegant final concerto, No. 27 in B flat. Mr. Davis, an eloquent Sibelius conductor, devotes the rest of the program to the Finnish composer's ''Lemminkainen'' Suite, a set of four tone poems that describe the feats of Lemminkainen as he endeavors to win the hand of Pohjola's daughter. At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96. (Kozinn) GARRICK OHLSSON (Sunday) Mr. Ohlsson plays four more sonatas in his admirable Beethoven series, including the ''Moonlight'' and the elusively beautiful Op. 101. At 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $56. (Holland) VASSILY PRIMAKOV (Sunday) Arium is a commodious cafe in the meatpacking district that is quickly becoming a popular site for classical music concerts. Its Sunday afternoon series continues with a recital by the young Russian pianist Vassily Primakov, who will play works by Schumann, Beethoven and Brahms. Complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres are served. At 4 p.m., Arium for the Arts, 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; $40; $20 for members. (Tommasini) * DAVID RUSSELL (Tonight and tomorrow night) This English guitarist has a finely polished technique and a sharp interpretive sensibility. He is giving a master class tonight, and tomorrow he will play a recital that includes his own transcriptions of Bach's A minor Partita (BWV 1013, originally for flute) and Granados's ''Valses Poéticos,'' as well as works by Weiss, Barrios, Mertz, José Brocá and Hans Haug. Master class tonight at 7, recital tomorrow at 8, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; master class, $20; recital, $40. (Kozinn) * ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and tomorrow night) Classical musicians are lucky: 30 is the cut-off age for ''young'' in the outside world, but if you're a conductor you get to be ''young'' till you're 60 or so. At 48, David Robertson is certainly one of the most-watched ''young'' conductors around: one of his strengths is interesting programming, as his concerts with his St. Louis Symphony show. The first juxtaposes George Benjamin's ''Sudden Time'' (a New York premiere); Bartok's first piano concerto, with the redoubtable Pierre-Laurent Aimard; and Sibelius's Second Symphony. The second brings in the mezzo Susan Graham (substituting for the recovering Dawn Upshaw) for Ravel's ''Shéhérazade,'' between the Adagio from Mahler's 10th and, perhaps the greatest treat of all, John Adams's ''Harmonielehre.'' At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $85. (Midgette) TALICH QUARTET (Sunday) None of the original members of this Czech quartet, founded in 1964, are still in the group. But the current four, Jan Talich and Petr Macecek, violinists; Vladimir Bukac, a violist; and Petr Prause, a cellist, continue the tradition of playing Czech repertory, as well as chamber works. They will perform Haydn's Quartet (Op. 64, No. 5); Mendelssohn's Quartet in A minor; and Janacek's Quartet No. 2 (''Intimate Letters''). At 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 547-0715, frick.org; $25. (Schweitzer) * TALLIS SCHOLARS (Tomorrow) Peter Phillips and his a cappella group have given some superb concerts of English Renaissance works recently, and they now turn their attention to Monteverdi, Palestrina, Gombert, Lassus and Browne. Among the centerpieces is Monteverdi's Mass for Four Voices, a work worth discovering if you don't know it (or revisiting if you do). At 8 p.m., Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 120th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * brooklyn museum: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is essentialist and body-oriented and doesn't venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art the exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Grace Glueck) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) * The METropolitan museum of art: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * The Met: 'Mother of Pearl: A Tradition in Asian Lacquer,' through April 1. Ornamentalism is the term for this show of some 40 objects so exquisite that they might have been conceived with a modern museum conservator's soft white cotton gloves in mind. The technique for creating mini-mosaics from slivers of mollusk shell is an ancient one that was perfected in China before traveling to Korea, Japan, Thailand and India. Examples from all those places are here in writing boxes and tea trays guaranteed to appeal to any window-shopper's acquisitive yearnings and magpie eye. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Moma: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This show makes a case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith) * Neue Galerie: 'Van Gogh and Expressionism,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious hommage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Schwendener) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea JEAN SHIN: KEY PROMISES The idea is obvious, if you're as keen as this artist on recycling everyday objects: an installation using the word commands of countless computer keyboards to orchestrate a flow of suggested actions, desires and emotional states across four walls of a small gallery. From esc and shift to return and home. Art lite, perhaps, but expertly done. Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992, frederieketaylorgallery.com, through April 7. (Smith) Galleries: Other 'Gifts of the Forest: Native Traditions in Wood and Bark' Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that for the most part carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, through April 27. (Glueck) Last Chance * DISSOCIATE: NEW HUMANS Dominated by poster-paintings on handy rolling bases, the occasional space-confounding mirror and sundry fliers, this mutable installation by the talented sculptor and sound artist Mika Tajima has served both as a performance space and as an advertising campaign for her noise band, New Humans. The textilelike patterns; limited, decoratorish palette; and diverse printing methods are a bit familiar to art in this age of self-conscious mechanical reproduction (Wade Guyton, for example). But it is worth seeing. Collaborators include the musician Howie Chen and the artists Vito Acconci, José Léon Cerillo and Philippe Decrauzat. Elizabeth Dee, 545 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-7545, elizabethdeegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * Sam Gordon: Three Ways: painting, Drawing, video There's a lot going on in this virtuosic solo show. Mr. Gordon's beautiful, cryptic drawings and paintings cover the gallery walls, while two sections of his epic video ''The Lost Kinetic World: Volumes 1-4,'' play on a monitor. The videos are a two-and-a-half-hour documentary compilation of art world events and personalities, good, bad and ugly, with past and present, prosaic and extraordinary, spliced together, willy-nilly. For whatever reason, Mr. Gordon watches the art world closely. Now it's time for the art world to wake up to him, a treasure in its midst. Feature Inc., 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7772; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Grey Art Gallery: 'Semina Culture: Wallace Berman & His Circle' The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * PHILIP TAAFFE This artist's first New York show since 2000 anoints him as one of the best painters of his generation, and maybe the only one to extend both 1970s Pattern and Decoration and '80s appropriation into new areas. Aided by Warhol's tinted colors and Pollock's all-over rhythms, and some ingenious printing techniques of their own, these suavely eye-popping new paintings sample everything from Northwest Coast Indian masks to Islamic ornamental patterns to marbleizing and gilding. They define visual culture as a great chain of being in which anything can be connected with proper placement, color and scale in an inspiring message of unity in difference. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * PAUL STRAND AT WORK More than three dozen vintage improbably rich, impeccably printed vintage photographs, taken by Strand between 1943 and 1953, make their measured, concentrated way through a range of rural subjects in New England, France and Italy and dot the gallery walls like faceted gems. Pace/MacGill Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'United Black Girls,' This group show is a response by six artists to the way the black female body appears in popular culture. Ifetayo A. Abdus-Salam takes charge by channeling Pam Grier; Jessica Peavy links early feminism and music videos; Heather Hart takes aim with crocheted guns. Omya Alston, Ashley Reid and Felicia Megginson combine images of exploitation and empowerment in various ways, with a healthy dose of attitude. Courtney J. Martin and Vanessa C. B. Riding put it all together. Rush Arts Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-9552; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)",

The Exchange, formerly known as the Jean Cocteau Rep, presents in repertory these new works by emerging British writers (1:30 each). Kirk Theater, 420 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than that of a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ANNE OF GREEN GABLES' The trick to refashioning beloved children's books for the stage is to keep both the spirit and the story largely intact. In this, Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford -- a musical-theater partnership of five decades' standing, who have moved from their hit ''I'm Getting My Act Together'' to the American Girl demographic -- have largely succeeded. This breezy, upbeat musical avoids slickness and gets the job done, and is nicely cast into the bargain (1:30). The Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette) * 'APOSTASY' Gino Dilorio's fearless play about a dying white Jewish woman who falls under the spell of a black televangelist is pretty good; the acting that delivers it is terrific, especially Susan Greenhill as the woman, and Susan Louise O'Connor as her daughter (2:00). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'EXITS AND ENTRANCES' Athol Fugard casts a tender glance back at an actor whose dedication to theater helped spark his own in this warm if insubstantial stage memoir. Morlan Higgins capably excavates the emotional core of a role that might have seemed generic, playing an aging gay actor reckoning with the end of an up-and-down career. William Dennis Hurley plays the Fugard stand-in (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) * 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MARIE ANTOINETTE: THE COLOR OF FLESH' Joel Gross's intriguing play features impeccable performances by Amanda Jones, Samantha Ives and Jonathan Kells Phillips as the three corners of a triangle of love and friendship caught up in the French Revolution. It's no ordinary triangle: Ms. Jones plays Marie Antoinette, and Ms. Ives the real portraitist who often painted her (1:30). The 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 254-9533. (Genzlinger) * 'THE NIBROC TRILOGY' ''Last Train to Nibroc,'' ''See Rock City'' and ''Gulf View Drive'' make no mention of 19th-century Russian intellectuals but they do signal the arrival of a talented American playwright, Arlene Hutton. Set in Kentucky and Florida, between the beginning of World War II and the early 1950s, the plays track the life of a young couple whose individual ambitions conflict; they also clash with the goals of a changing American society. Straightforward and heartfelt, but never treacly, the works stand out in a cold, postmodern universe. Try ''See Rock City'' if you have time for only one (1:25, 1:30 and 1:55). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) 'OUR LEADING LADY' Kate Mulgrew stars as Laura Keene, who was starring in ''Our American Cousin'' on the night Lincoln was shot, in Charles Busch's uneven new comedy. An occasionally lively but mostly lumpen tribute to the glamour and grit of the theatrical life of a past era (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley) Last Chance 'THE DARK AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS' Jack Cummings III directs a respectable if reverential revival of William Inge's last major play. Seeking to access the poetry in Inge's homely tale of troubled lives in the Midwest in the 1920s, he can't quite hide its fundamentally prosaic qualities. Still, this Transport Group production gives audiences a chance to encounter a rarely seen drama from Broadway's heyday (2:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood) 'FUGUE' ''Mary Smith'' is found wandering the streets of Chicago, suffering from amnesia. A young psychiatrist, who has his own demons, is consulted, and the process of treatment and Mary's memories in flashback are the action of ''Fugue,'' Lee Thuna's unrewarding play, directed by the Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey (2:15). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Moore) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'SERENDIB' David Zellnik's play about a group of scientists observing monkeys in Sri Lanka tackles questions about masculinity and social dominance within a framework that is too cute by half. That said, Mr. Zellnik seems to have more on his mind than many young playwrights (1:55). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 247-4982; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'SOME MEN' Terrence McNally's hit-and-miss comedy about gay life is a parade of cleanly drawn types, zippy one-liners and sentimental set pieces, woven into a pageant of the ages à la ''Cavalcade,'' Noël Coward's generations-spanning tribute to the British stiff upper lip. Trip Cullman directs the agile, appealing cast (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'TROPHY WIFE' Honky-tonk piano music and flickering film credits on a screen behind the stage set the tone for this slender period piece about a young woman who marries a wealthy older man to help her family's financial difficulties. The plot is taken from a short story by Chekhov, but it works fine in the 1920s milieu to which Mary Fulham and Terry Waldo, who wrote and performs the music, have transposed it; Mr. Waldo has also provided a veritable cornucopia of songs, to which Sharon Ann Farrell, as the ingénue, can at least do justice. But the piece, which seems a bouncy entertainment, turns out to want to stress its darker side; its abrupt ending leaves you hanging, wondering if, to make its point, the whole tone might have been a little less frothy (1:15). La MaMa E.T.C., 74 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Midgette) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AFTER THE WEDDING' (R, 119 minutes, in Danish) A modern creation with a classic theme involving haves and have-nots, bloodlines and family ties. The canned realism of the Danish director Susanne Bier is strictly Dogme-lite, but the spiky, screen-filling performances of her two male leads, Mads Mikkelsen and Rolf Lassgard, are really something to see. (Manohla Dargis) 'AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE COLON MOVIE FILM FOR THEATERS' (R, 87 minutes) Not as funny as the title or the Cartoon Network series on which it's based. (A. O. Scott) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'DREAMING LHASA' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Tibetan and English) This documentary from Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam is about a Tibetan-American documentary-maker named Karma (Tenzin Chokyi Gyatso), who is making a movie about Tibetans who fled persecution by the Chinese and settled in Dharamsala, the Dalai Lama's exile headquarters in northern India. The movie is filled with heartbreaking moments, . but the central story, about the relationship between Karma and an ex-monk named Dhondup (Jampa Kalsang), can't help feeling contrived. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'FIREHOUSE DOG' (PG, 111 minutes) When a pampered Hollywood pooch trades his movie-star lifestyle for a rundown firehouse, it's not long before he is saving a father-son relationship and tracking down a serial arsonist. Yet the movie's wittiest moment -- a canine parody of Dudley Moore's first glimpse of Bo Derek in ''10'' -- will be appreciated only by parents, and in trying to straddle both age groups, ''Firehouse Dog'' proves decidedly less nimble than its furry star. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'THE GLAMOROUS LIFE OF SACHIKO HANAI' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Japanese) A wayward bullet turns a hooker into a brainiac in this Japanese clutter of soft-core political parody, hard-core narrative nonsense, breezy sexism and penny-ante surrealism. (Dargis) 'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than the entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) 'THE HOLY MOUNTAIN' (No rating, 114 minutes, in Spanish) A scandal when first released, Alejandro Jodorowsky's 1973 movie -- a follow-up to his midnight landmark ''El Topo'' -- is a dazzling, rambling, often incoherent satire on consumerism, militarism and the exploitation of third world cultures by the west. The free-associative narrative follows a Christ-like thief through a series of surreal tableaus; the mission ends with a postmodern punch line that suggests that movies are drugs too, and the revolution can't happen until we kick our habits. (Seitz) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece, independent to the bone. (Dargis) 'LONELY HEARTS' (No rating, 100 minutes) This beautifully photographed remake of Leonard Kastle's 1970 cult B movie ''The Honeymoon Killers'' succeeds better than many modern crime dramas in balancing the philosophical with the visceral, although its villains' dirty deeds still trump its deeper strain of melancholy. (Holden) 'THE LOOKOUT' (R, 99 minutes) This directorial debut by the veteran screenwriter Scott Frank (''Out of Sight'') is a variation of an old, old story, about a nobody (a brain-damaged janitor played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who falls in with crooks who make him feel like somebody. Although the movie's no masterpiece -- the final stretch feels forced and unconvincing -- there's a lot to like here. (Seitz) 'MEET THE ROBINSONS' (G, 93 minutes) Actually, if you see them coming, run in the other direction. (Scott) 'PATHFINDER' (R, 100 minutes) It's all grunting, all goring in this witless period flick about some Norsemen of the apocalypse come to wreak bloody ruin in the New World. (Dargis) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' (No rating, 120 minutes, in French) A film from the venerable French auteur Alain Resnais about love and cinematic spaces, elegant camera moves and six heavenly bodies as seen through a mighty telescope. (Dargis) * 'RED ROAD' (No rating, 113 minutes) Andrea Arnold's first feature falls into melodrama and implausibility at the end, but along the way it is a remarkably assured and complex piece of work, anchored by the director's formal control and by Jackie Dick's quietly heartbreaking performance as a Glasgow video-surveillance officer with an unhappy past. (Scott) 'REIGN OVER ME' (R, 124 minutes) Mike Binder's comic drama of post-9/11 grief is wildly uneven -- by turns insightful and grindingly mawkish. Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler are two college buddies who reunite, somewhat improbably, some years after the attacks that robbed one of them of his family. The actors rise above the material, particularly in the longer, looser scenes that allow their contrasting temperaments -- Mr. Cheadle's tense understatement and Mr. Sandler's shaggy emoting -- to find a workable syncopation. (Scott) * 'ROCK THE BELLS' (No rating, 103 minutes) Casey Suchan and Denis Henry Hennelly's lively documentary follows the independent music promoter Chang Weisberg as he struggles to reunite the original members of the Wu-Tang Clan for a 2004 hip-hop concert. Capturing onstage and off with equal energy, the movie is a fascinating glimpse of a dreamer and a music culture that has always depended on them. (Catsoulis) 'SLOW BURN' (R, 93 minutes) There's not a line of dialogue that doesn't sound squeezed from a grade-C ''Law & Order'' imitator affecting a bogus inner-city street cred. (Holden) 'THE TV SET' (R, 87 minutes) Jake Kasdan's knowing satire of network television sends up the neuroses of writers and the ruthlessness of executives with minimal exaggeration. Nothing in this story of a writer (David Duchovny) pursuing his dream project seems implausible, which is less a limitation on the movie's comedy than it is its source. (Scott) 'VOICE OF A MURDERER' (No rating, 122 minutes, in Korean) The unpredictable Korean director Park Jin-pyo returns to the docudrama form with this fictionalized account of the unsolved 1991 kidnapping and killing of a 9-year-old boy. Filmed relentlessly from the point of view of the distraught parents (Sol Kyung-gu and Kim Nam-joo), the movie unfolds in endless, repetitive scenes of parental hysteria punctuated by phone calls from the shadowy abductor. By the 44th day and the umpteenth call, it's déjà vu all over again. (Catsoulis) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) Film Series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER SING-ALONG (Tonight) The IFC Center tries to get a little ''Rocky Horror'' action going by sponsoring a midnight screening of this cult television show's celebrated all-singing, all-dancing episode. Audience participation is strongly encouraged. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Dave Kehr) * COMMITMENT AND GRACE: THE FILMS OF CARLOS SAURA (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Saura is, of course, one of Spain's great film masters. But for those who love dance, he will always be an artist who spoke vivid new truths about Spanish dancing and the relationship between film and dance. This tribute by the Film Society of Lincoln Center covers 50 years of his work, with ''Blood Wedding'' and ''Sevillanas'' on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m., and ''Carmen'' on Thursday at 1 p.m. (Through May 3.) Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.com; $11; $7 for students with ID and for 65+ at weekday screenings before 6 p.m.; $40 for a series pass for eight films. (Jennifer Dunning) INDIA NOW (Sunday through Thursday) Nine new features and two short films from India, in a series co-sponsored by the Museum of Modern Art and the Indo-American Arts Council. On the opening night the director Rahul Dholakia will introduce his controversial feature ''Parzania,'' a fictionalized account of the Gujarat riots of 2002. Other highlights include Arindam Mitra's ''Shoonya'' (Monday), an adaptation of T. S. Eliot's ''Murder in the Cathedral'' transposed to the world of Indian cricket, and ''Kaalpurush'' (''Memories in the Mist''), a new work by the Bengali filmmaker Buddhadeb Dasgupta (Wednesday). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ACID MOTHERS TEMPLE (Thursday) This Japanese band describes its style as ''extreme trip music,'' which basically means big, sloppy, psychedelic noise jams. It doesn't necessarily mean peasant frocks and long wizard's robes, but Acid Mothers Temple usually has plenty of those too. With Mammatus and Alasehoutek. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Ben Sisario) ASHFORD AND SIMPSON (Tomorrow) The Steve and Eydie of pop-soul still put on a convincing and musically solid demonstration of being the world's happiest show-business couple. With Melba Moore. At 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171, apollotheater.com; $45 to $65. (Stephen Holden) * BASEMENT BHANGRA (Tonight) For 10 years Rekha Malhotra, better known as DJ Rekha, has been leading this dance party at the downtown club S.O.B.'s, introducing legions of New Yorkers to the musky sound of bhangra, which melds Punjabi folk melodies with reggae and house-rocking electronic beats. Her efforts have been instrumental in popularizing the style in America, and she celebrates the milestone with an all-star anniversary show at the Hammerstein Ballroom, which should feel about 100 times bigger than S.O.B.'s but just as hot. Guests include Panjabi MC (whose song with Jay-Z, ''Beware of the Boys,'' is bhangra's biggest hit), Dhol Foundation and Bikram Singh. At 9 p.m., 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $35 to $100. (Sisario) BRAND NEW (Sunday) Not all emo goes the way of smirky punk-pop or sentimental singalongs. This excellent Long Island band plies dense, angry tangles of guitar and opaque lyrics of spiritual crisis, a cross between Pink Floyd and Nirvana. With Kevin Devine and the Manchester Orchestra. At 7 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sisario) THE BUNKER (Tonight) Honking saxophones and screeching guitars were the best-known musical residents of Tonic, the Lower East side club that closed last week. But Tonic was also an important home for avant-garde electronica. The Bunker, Tonic's long-running late-night techno party, is moving to a new club without missing a single week. Tonight it opens at the Luna Lounge, another former Lower East Side boîte, which is now in Brooklyn. Besides the resident D.J.'s, Spinoza and Derek Plaslaiko, tonight features Bodycode, a noisemaker based in Portugual who is also known as Portable (and as Alan Abrahams). At midnight, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, lunalounge.com; $10. (Sisario) CLIPSE (Thursday) Comeback stories in rap are rare and sweet. In 2002 this Virginia duo rose to the Top 10 with sly rhymes about the cocaine trade and brutally minimal rhythm tracks by the Neptunes. Since then Clipse struggled in music-industry purgatory but triumphed with ''Hell Hath No Fury'' (Re-Up Gang/Jive), another cold, lean and virtuosic exercise that was one of last year's best hip-hop albums. With Monica and Jovan Dais. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $30. (Sisario) * JARVIS COCKER (Sunday and Monday) Carrying on the wittily misanthropic vignette style he perfected in his 1990s Britpop band, Pulp, Mr. Cocker, now 43, has returned with a solo album, ''Jarvis'' (Rough Trade). Without his former band, he is just as caustic but seems to have turned into a studio tinkerer, sampling the Righteous Brothers and Tommy James. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $32 in advance, $35 at the door (sold out on Monday). (Sisario) COCOROSIE (Tonight) As CocoRosie, the Casady sisters, Sierra and Bianca, make swirling and surrealistic dramas out of girlish daydreams, hints of trip-hop, chirping crickets and cooed Billie Holiday-ish vocals. With Tez and the Girls of Karen Black. At 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $20. (Sisario) CONSTANTINES, TIM FITE (Thursday) Constantines is a feedback-worshiping Canadian band in the neo-MC5 mold: the bigger their guitar chords, the higher their fists fly. Tim Fite is harder to pin down. A lo-fi lone wolf from Brooklyn, he is somewhere between folk and hip-hop, and with his latest album, ''Over the Counter Culture'' -- a harsh rap indictment of consumerism and the American dream of selling out, which he offers free on his Web site (timfite.com) -- he has made himself into a cultural gadfly. At 8:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) * DEERHUNTER (Thursday) Recalling Spacemen 3, this Atlanta quintet plays loose, sprawling psychedelia that grows from sweet guitar and vocal melodies into patterns that seem both florid and evil. With First Nation and Pterodactyl. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) DIMMU BORGIR (Thursday) Dimmu Borgir is a Norwegian black-metal band: black as in dark and dismal, with haunted-house keyboard arpeggios and vocals rendered in an electronically processed monster growl. It's good for a shudder; few kinds of fans are as deeply into their scene as those who attend these shows, and the band doesn't come to the United States often. With Unearth, DevilDriver and Kataklysm. At 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $25 in advance, $29 at the door. (Ben Ratliff) * DNTEL (Wednesday) As he did in the Postal Service, his project with Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie, Jimmy Tamborello -- who has been recording under the name Dntel for a decade or more -- gracefully joins stutters of electronic noise and soft, pensive melodies. His latest, ''Dumb Luck'' (Sub Pop), features collaborations with indie royalty like Bright Eyes, Jenny Lewis and Grizzly Bear, which means that you might be hearing this gurgly, not-quite-innocuous music, like the Postal Service, on late-night bar playlists for years to come. At 10 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484; free. (Sisario) * FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE (Tuesday) Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne earned their seats in the songwriting pantheon with a fluent power-pop classicism and songs that celebrate beta males and bridge-and-tunnel quotidiana (and, in the case of their 2003 hit, ''Stacy's Mom,'' teenage fantasies of older women.) Their new album, ''Traffic and Weather'' (Virgin), is full of familiar Fountains of Wayne-isms, with Beatlesesque chord progressions and stories of love encumbered by competition for taxis. With Robbers on High Street. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario) * FRATELLIS (Thursday) Like Sweet and Slade before it, this Scottish trio is not afraid to be both tough and silly, employing bubblegum shout-alongs in its stompy, completely catchy hard-rock tunes. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sisario) KRISTIN HERSH (Wednesday) Through the 1980s and '90s Ms. Hersh led Throwing Muses, the textbook college rock band, whose songs set turbulent and free-associative psychodramas to twisting guitar lines. Motherhood and experience have softened her music somewhat, but she remains a provocative songwriter, and her voice has aged into an expressive, sensual rasp. For this show her band will be augmented by a string section. With Dolorean. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) TAYLOR HICKS (Tonight) ''American Idol'' has sent many singers into the shark tank of Top 40 radio, but this smoky-voiced Alabama crooner, who has more in common with Michael McDonald than with Kelly Clarkson, heads in the direction of buttery soul. At 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $36 to $62. (Sisario) HOT CHIP (Tonight) With wobbly electronic rhythms and a strong command of the drippy, semi-ironic disco ballad, this English group plays wistful but still snarky dance music. Get too lost in the beats and you'll miss gags like the oh-so-art-rock countdown of nonsense words in descending size (''S-E-X-I-N-G, C-A-S-I-O, P-O-K-E''). With Tussle. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) * JOHN LEGEND, CORINNE BAILEY RAE (Sunday and Monday) A five-time Grammy winner, John Legend has the right to be a little cocky. But on his second album, ''Once Again'' (Sony), he plays the gentleman -- for the most part, anyway. Channeling the most tasteful of '70s R&B, he permits himself the slightest racy double-entendre, telling his lady that ''love hurts sometimes when you do it right.'' In a sweet, tissue-thin voice, Corinne Bailey Rae sings of sisterly rituals, loves lost and her ''choux pastry heart.'' Sunday at 7:30 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; Monday at 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com. Both sold out. (Sisario) DAVE MATTHEWS AND TIM REYNOLDS (Sunday) The jam-band frog prince plays with an old guitar buddy whose style leans toward world-fusion. Expect long solos and inside jokes. At 7:30 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $75. (Sisario) LOREENA McKENNITT (Tonight) On ''An Ancient Muse'' (Verve), her first album in nine years, this Canadian singer explored her Celtic heritage in depth, from the British Isles to Turkey and along the Silk Road of Central Asia. And what did she find? Pretty much what she already knew: that with the help of some gossamer major-chord swells and reverberant, Enya-like vocals, any sound can be incorporated into the New Age fantasy of Celtic music. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $35 to $75. (Sisario) ERIN McKEOWN (Tonight) A smiley sprite whose knack for wordplay and light touch on the guitar have sometimes evoked Tin Pan Alley, Ms. McKeown took the plunge in her new album, ''Sing You Sinners'' (Nettwerk), recording 12 nuggets by Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Fats Waller and others (along with one by herself). If her voice is not quite up to the subtleties of wit the songs demand, her joy of discovery is sincere. With John Southworth. At 7:30, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. (Sisario) NOISETTES (Monday) Conjuring the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and X-Ray Spex, this London band, led by the throaty and uninhibited Shingai Shoniwa, plays grimy, muscular punk-funk punctuated with lighter touches of something like vaudeville. With Looker and Cities on Fire. At 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. (Sisario) RICKY SKAGGS AND BRUCE HORNSBY (Tuesday) One of the most virtuosic musicians in bluegrass, Ricky Skaggs sends his fingers flying in a blur over mandolin, guitar and fiddle. He performs with Bruce Hornsby, whose years playing with the Grateful Dead have made him a more versatile and playful musician. The two have a new, untitled album that is maybe a little too versatile and playful: it includes a cornball version of Rick James's ''Super Freak.'' At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $50 and $60. (Sisario) Keely Smith (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) This ''queen of swing,'' as she has been nicknamed, may be the last surviving top-of-the-line entertainer from the Rat Pack era of Las Vegas. She is still in reasonably good voice. (Through April 28.) At 8:45, with additional shows at 10:45 tonight and tomorrow night, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 cover tonight and tomorrow night, $65 and $100 Tuesday through Thursday. (Holden) PATTI SMITH (Tuesday) With ''Twelve'' (Columbia), a new album in which Ms. Smith covers the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Nirvana -- whose ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' gets an eccentric, bluegrass-tinged interpretation -- she and her band play three separate shows at the Bowery Ballroom on Tuesday night; tickets to each performance include a copy of the CD. At 6, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * RICHARD SWIFT, DAVID VANDERVELDE (Tomorrow and Sunday) Retro-pop can easily go the way of mere imitation, but these singers have found ways to evoke their heroes without being entirely defined by them. Richard Swift's cynical gloss on piano-driven cabaret-rock adds a taste of vinegar to Harry Nilsson. David Vandervelde, from Chicago, has the thin whine and androgynous swagger of T. Rex down pat, but also wisely pursues his gift for the elegiac folk-rock ballad. Tomorrow at 9:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. Sunday at 10 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733, pianosnyc.com; $12. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. BUFFALO COLLISION (Monday) Free improvisation is the working method for this collective, made up of the saxophonist Tim Berne, the violist Mat Maneri, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the drummer David King. As the name implies, results will be concussive at times, and maybe a bit hairy (in a good way). At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12; $8 for students.

(Chinen) AL FOSTER QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The well-traveled drummer Al Foster has a lithe touch, ideal for modern jazz and more than suitable for funk; his band consists of the tenor saxophonist Eli Degibri, the pianist Kevin Hays and the bassist Doug Weiss. (Through April 29.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * FREQUENCY/ ANGELICA SANCHEZ TRIO (Sunday) Frequency is a Chicago-based ensemble consisting of the saxophonist and clarinetist Edward Wilkerson, the flutist Nicole Mitchell, the bassist Harrison Bankhead and the drummer Avreeayl Ra; its self-titled debut, released last year on the Thrill Jockey label, pairs textural experimentation with a slippery sense of swing. That stylistic negotiation is likely to resurface in a later set with Angelica Sanchez on piano, Tony Malaby on saxophone and Tom Rainey on drums. At 7 and 9 p.m., Jimmy's, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006, freestylejazz.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum.

INTERLOPER (Tomorrow and Sunday) David King, the intensely propulsive drummer for Happy Apple and the Bad Plus, formed this Minneapolis-centered group with the bassist Greg Norton, a former member of the influential post-punk band Hüsker Dü. Adding to the prog-rock churn are Craig Taborn, on keyboards, and Erik Fratzke (of Happy Apple), on guitar.

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; $10 for members. (Chinen) * HUMAN FEEL (Tomorrow) This reunited confab -- Chris Speed and Andrew D'Angelo on reeds, Jim Black on drums and Kurt Rosenwinkel on guitar -- has a smartly enigmatic new album called ''Galore'' (Skirl), its first in a decade. Its strength lies in an ideal of interconnectedness, and a tonal palette partly informed by underground rock. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; suggested donation, $5.

Tomorrow he leads a quartet with Freddie Hendrix on trumpet, Jared Gold on organ and Bill McClelland on drums; on Sunday he presents his Reunion Trio, with Pheeroan akLaff on drums and Michael Gregory on guitars. Tomorrow at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766, sistasplace.org; cover, $25 in advance, $30 at the door.

(Chinen) THE LEGENDS OF BLUE NOTE (Thursday) The celebrated hard boppers from the 1960s Blue Note roster -- like Lee Morgan and Horace Silver -- provide a promising repertory foundation for this concert, featuring new arrangements for the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. (Through April 28.) At 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $37.50 to $127.50. (Chinen) MAHAVISHNU PROJECT (Tomorrow) This single-minded repertory project, led by the percussionist Gregg Bendian, boldly apprehends the fusion of the Mahavishnu Orchestra. As on its new Cuneiform release, the group involves a total of 11 musicians here, performing all the material from the 1975 album ''Visions of the Emerald Beyond.'' At 9 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, near Columbus Avenue, (212) 601-1000, mahavishnuproject.com; cover, $15. (Chinen) RON MILES /JENNY SCHEINMAN (Monday) Mr. Miles is a trumpeter with a dual attraction to sunlight and shadow, as he demonstrated on ''Stone/Blossom,'' a double album issued last year. He performs an early set with his band, and then joins Ms. Scheinman, a thoughtful violinist and frequent collaborator, in a set of her own. At 7 and 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10 a set. (Chinen) * CHARLES MINGUS: EPITAPH (Wednesday) Charles Mingus never saw a full performance of ''Epitaph,'' his epic orchestral composition; its premiere at Lincoln Center in 1989, came a decade after his death. That concert's conductor, Gunther Schuller, resuscitates the work here with a 30-piece orchestra; he also includes ''Inquisition,'' a recently discovered movement that has never been performed. Among the accomplished musicians in the ensemble is Christian McBride, filling Mingus's formidable bass chair. At 7:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)721-6500, jalc.org; $45.

(Chinen) * DINO SALUZZI AND ANJA LECHNER (Tuesday) ''Ojos Negros'' (ECM) is a sparse and often haunting new album by Mr. Saluzzi, an Argentine bandoneón player, and Ms. Lechner, a German cellist; tango feeds into its mood, but so do jazz and some mournful strains of the European classical tradition. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35 in advance, $40 tomorrow. (Chinen) SAMBA JAZZ & MUSIC OF JOBIM (Tuesday through Thursday) A cosmopolitan Brazilian-jazz ensemble consisting of the pianist Helio Alves, the drummer Duduka da Fonseca, the trumpeter Claudio Roditi and the bassist Eddie Gomez.

(Chinen) STILL LIFE WITH COMMENTATOR (Tomorrow) The brazen theatricality of the modern news cycle fuels this collaboration between the pianist and composer Vijay Iyer and the poet Mike Ladd, originally presented at Brooklyn Academy of Music in December. The work is scaled back here but still features Pamela Z and Guillermo Brown on vocals, Okkyung Lee on cello and Liberty Ellman on guitar. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen) * JOHN ZORN (Thursday) A couple months ago Columbia University presented the iconoclastic composer John Zorn with its William Schuman Award, a distinction of lifetime-achievement proportions. Mr. Zorn now presents selections from his fathomless oeuvre at the school's Miller Theater, including chamber works, Masada miniatures and ''Cobra,'' his celebrated game piece. At 7:30 p.m., Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheatre.com; $15. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Thursday) This production conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of, notably, the captivating mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato as a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. But some major changes are coming this week. The emerging American tenor Lawrence Brownlee makes his Met debut as Count Almaviva, and the hardy German baritone Russell Braun sings Figaro. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'La Finta Giardiniera' (Wednesday) Singers from the Juilliard Opera Center present a staged production of Mozart's first mature opera buffa, which he wrote at 18. The cast includes Erin Morley as the Marchioness. Jay Lesenger directs, and Gary Thor Wedow conducts the Juilliard Orchestra. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, juilliard.edu; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Vivien Schweitzer) 'FLAVIO' (Tomorrow) Candy pink and candy green set the tone for Chas Rader-Shieber's antic production of this opera, which consists of arias nestled side by side, bright and sweet as a box of fondants. Making company debuts are Katherine Rohrer, a light mezzo with a nice tone; Gerald Thompson, a promising but sometimes wild countertenor; and the conductor William Lacey, who led a strong, lithe performance on opening night. David Walker was fine as the foppish, foolish king of the title. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Anne Midgette) * 'GIULIO CESARE' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Though its auditorium is too big for Handel, the Metropolitan Opera makes this work come alive, thanks to exceptional Handel singers. The countertenor David Daniels excels in the daunting title role, and the soprano Ruth Ann Swenson makes a vocally exquisite Cleopatra. Patricia Bardon, a rich-toned Irish mezzo-soprano, brings lyrical elegance to the role of Cornelia. Harry Bicket conducts stylishly. (On Tuesday the countertenor Lawrence Zazzo, who has been singing Tolomeo, takes over the title role; Danielle de Niese sings Cleopatra; and Jill Grove sings Cornelia.) Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 to $375 tickets remaining for tomorrow; $15 to $175 for Tuesday. (Tommasini) 'L'ITALIANA IN LONDRA' (Wednesday) Rossini's Italian girl got to Algiers; Cimarosa's, a generation earlier, made it only as far as London, but both were in pursuit of their beloveds. Cimarosa's opera is this year's little-known offering in the pleasingly offbeat canon of the Manhattan School of Music. Steven Mosteller conducts; Albert Sherman directs. At 8 p.m., Manhattan School of Music, Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428, msmnyc.edu; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Midgette) 'Madama Butterfly' (Tonight and Sunday) Paul Kellogg's administration at New York City Opera ends along with the spring season in these last two performances of this Puccini crowd-pleaser. Shu-Ying Li and Christopher Jackson head the cast in a minimalist production by Mark Lamos. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $93 remaining tonight, sold out on Sunday. (Bernard Holland) 'MANON LESCAUT' (Tonight through Sunday) Because of its difficulties, this early masterpiece by Puccini probably does not appear in production as often as the music merits. There are two long and demanding lead roles, crowd scenes, intimate scenes and a teeming orchestra score. The adventurous Dicapo Opera Theater is presenting a production by Michael Capasso this weekend, conducted by Pacien Mazzagatti, with rotating leads in the main roles of the impulsive Manon and her lover Des Grieux. It should be interesting to experience the opera in the company's intimate theater. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini) * 'IL TRITTICO' (Tonight and Monday night) The Broadway stage director Jack O'Brien has taken on two trilogies at Lincoln Center in the same year. First was Tom Stoppard's ''Coast of Utopia,'' and now he has moved on to Puccini's trilogy of dissimilar one-acters, in which he makes his debut tonight at the Met. The cast includes Salvatore Licitra, Barbara Frittoli and the inimitable Stephanie Blythe. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $175 remaining tonight; sold out on Monday. (Midgette) 'TURANDOT' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) For spectacle and big music, the Franco Zeffirelli production of Puccini's final opera, at the Met, is hard to beat. For compelling leads, you might have to look elsewhere. Erika Sunnegardh has replaced the shaky Andrea Gruber in the lead, joining Richard Margison (who does at least have the vocal heft for the role). Liping Zhang, an acclaimed Covent Garden Butterfly, has taken over as Liù, and Marco Armiliato, whose conducting seems increasingly wishy-washy this year, leads the orchestra. But spectacle and size are evidently enough to keep tickets selling briskly. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out tomorrow; $100 to $175 for Wednesday. (Midgette) Classical Music * ACADEMY OF ANCIENT MUSIC (Thursday) Richard Egarr, the harpsichordist and conductor, was recently appointed Christopher Hogwood's successor as music director of the Academy of Ancient Music. Mr. Egarr will lead the period-instrument orchestra in three of Handel's six Concerti Grossi (Op. 3), which he recently recorded on Harmonia Mundi in warm, polished and dignified performances. The Carnegie program also includes Telemann's ''Water Music'' Suite in C and Handel's ''Water Music'' Suite in G. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Schweitzer) ELAINE ALVAREZ (Sunday) The Marilyn Horne Foundation presents its final ''On Wings of Song'' recital of the season. In her enticing program, this Cuban-American soprano explores the feminine mystique through songs inspired by the Swedish folk character Ingelill, a young maiden who drowns herself out of despair over a lost love. She will sing songs by Stenhammar, Sibelius, Liszt, Strauss and Bo Linde. John Churchwell is the accompanist. At 3 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 378-0248, stbarts.org; $20; $15 for 65+; free for students. (Tommasini) * EMANUEL AX and EDGAR MEYER (Tonight) Mingling Bach and bluegrass is standard operating procedure for Edgar Meyer, the double-bassist for whom crossover is not a marketing ploy but a natural mode of being. Plenty of mingling takes place on this program, performed with the pianist Emanuel Ax. At one end of the spectrum are Bach and Haydn, arranged for the players' respective instruments; at the other are New York premieres of works by Mr. Meyer; Bright Sheng, the acclaimed Chinese composer; and the mandolin player Chris Thile, a former prodigy and an artist rapidly becoming as diverse as Mr. Meyer himself. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $48 and $54. (Midgette) BENJAMIN BAGBY (Sunday) Relying on hefty research and a bit of inspired guesswork, Mr. Bagby offers his re-creation of the ancient Bardic tradition in dramatic performances of ''Beowulf.'' At 1 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 650-2290, metmuseum.org; $35.

At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, brooklynphilharmonic.org; $20 to $60. (Kozinn) CHANTICLEER (Thursday) This all-male vocal ensemble will give the premiere of its latest commission, ''And on Earth, Peace: A Chanticleer Mass,'' for which five diverse composers each contributed a movement. The American composer Douglas J. Cuomo wrote the Kyrie; the Turkish-American composer Kamran Ince wrote the Gloria section to a Sufi text; Michael McGlynn, who is Irish, contributed the Agnus Dei; Ivan Moody, a Briton, wrote the Sanctus; and the Israeli-American composer Shulamit Ran wrote the Credo. At 8 p.m., Temple of Dendur, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $70. (Schweitzer) * COMPOSER PORTRAIT: KIMMO HAKOLA (Tuesday) The Miller Theater's Composer Portraits is a kind of stealth series, since the concerts spotlight not only a composer, but also a performing ensemble. The composer, in this case, is the energetic Kimmo Hakola, whose music is getting its first large-scale treatment in New York; the ensemble is Present Music, an enterprising new-music group based in Milwaukee, conducted by Kevin Stalheim, which commissioned one of the works on the program. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25; $15 for students. (Midgette) * EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow) Frederick Renz leads his period-instrument chamber orchestra in an all-Haydn program that includes three symphonies -- No. 26 (''Lamentatione''), No. 30 (''Alleluia'') and No. 83 (''La Poule'') -- as well as a Concerto for Two Flutes and a Divertimento for Winds.

A recipient of a career grant from the Richard Tucker Foundation, Mr. Kelsey will sing works by Handel, Brahms, Finzi and Mussorgsky with the pianist Tamara Sanikidze. The event is presented by Carnegie Hall and the Marilyn Horne Foundation. At 7:30, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 and $34. (Tommasini) KREMERATA BALTICA (Monday) Gidon Kremer's eclectic chamber band offers some of its specialties, from Beethoven (the Grosse Fuge) and Schumann (a violin version of the Cello Concerto) to Korngold (the Symphonic Serenade) and Piazzolla (''Las Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas''). At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. (Kozinn) * MIDORI (Tuesday) This adventurous violinist and champion of contemporary music offers the New York premiere of Einojuhani Rautavaara's ''Lost Landscapes.'' She commissioned the work in 2005 and performed its world premiere in Munich last year with the pianist Robert McDonald, who accompanies her here.

Núñez, the music director of this chorus, has long believed that at an early age, musicians should develop, and benefit from, associations with established composers. The group's ''Transient Glory'' program offers premieres of works written for the young choristers by Ned Rorem, Bruce Adolphe, Michael Gordon, Meredith Monk and Tarik O'Regan. At 7:30 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, ypc.org; $25; $10 for parents and students. (Tommasini) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AILEY II (Tonight through Sunday) Alvin Ailey created a second, or junior, company in 1974, almost casually, as a way of working on new choreography. Ailey II is now a world-class troupe, filled with dancers who are not only good but also capable of performing with a youthful hunger, as well as with a reverence for dance that is a part of the mission of the company director, Sylvia Waters, whom Ailey himself chose to direct that first group. Now Ailey II is coming home, performing in the black-box theater that is part of the Ailey headquarters: newer, grander and more gleaming than Ailey ever envisioned. The repertory will include new dances by Abdel Salaam, Darrell Grand Moultrie and Jessica Lang, along with Ailey's ''Streams'' and a chunk of Ailey highlights. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, alvinailey.org; $40; $10 student rush tickets available.

(Dunning) * EIFMAN BALLET OF ST. PETERSBURG (Tonight through Thursday) There is no one in world dance quite like Boris Eifman, for better or for worse. Whatever else he is, Mr. Eifman is a theatrical genius whose ballets are almost always flamboyant fun. This week the company will perform his new ''Seagull,'' after the Chekhov play, through Sunday, followed by ''Russian Hamlet'' on Wednesday and Thursday. (Through April 29.) Tonight and Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $35 to $100. (Dunning) GENDER BENDER: MONICA BILL BARNES AND NICHOLASLEICHTERDANCE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Barnes's modern-dance choreography is known for its theatricality and knowing humor. And Mr. Leichter explores race and sex with provocative pairings of dancers in work that draws from traditional and street-dance styles. At 8:30, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $17 to $25. (Dunning) KENNEDY DANCERS (Thursday) Based in Jersey City, this modern-dance troupe will celebrate its 30th anniversary with a program of dances by the company director, Diane Dragone, with one work by a different guest group each night. Donna Scro Gentile's Freespace Dance will perform at the opening. (Through April 28.) At 7:30 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (201) 659-2190; $20; $18 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Peter Kyle Dance (Tonight through Sunday night) Peter Kyle was a longtime dancer with Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis, and he now makes intelligent, humorous work that seems to be frequently inspired by literature. This program of new pieces features ''Nearer'' and ''Fallow Bogs,'' both with live music; and ''On the Divide,'' inspired by Willa Cather's ''O Pioneers.'' At 8, Joyce Soho, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $15; $10 for students. (Roslyn Sulcas) * LAR LUBOVITCH DANCE COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Known for the rich flow of his modern-dance choreography, Mr. Lubovitch and his eloquent dancers will present two programs, which include ''Little Rhapsodies,'' with Rasta Thomas, a guest dancer, and Pedja Muzijevic, who will play the piece's Schumann piano score, as well as the music for ''Dvorak Serenade in E.'' Tonight's gala program also includes ''Recordare,'' performed by the Limón Dance Company At 8, Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, www.skirballcenter.nyu.edu; $250, $500 and $1,000 tonight; $45 tomorrow. (Dunning) BARBARA MAHLER (Tonight through Sunday) ''There's No Place Like Home''' features choreography distinguished by tight focus and strong physicality. At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15. (Jack Anderson) LA MAMA MOVES! (Thursday) More than 50 companies and soloists, chosen by Nicky Paraiso and Mia Yoo, will perform in this celebration of downtown dance, in programs that will spill out throughout the nooks and crannies of the funky La MaMa complex. The festival opens with ''New Virtuosity,'' a program that includes dances by Robert Battle, Patrick Corbin, Tynek Dusan, Sunhwa Chung and Nick Seligson-Ross. At 7:30 p.m., La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) GLORIA MCLEAN (Sunday) Ms. McLean, a leading dancer with Erick Hawkins, will present ''Fossil Garden,'' a piece that unfolds amid a sculpture installation by Ken Hiratsuka. The program, which includes a video and sound installation by Jack Waters and Peter Cramer, takes place in Mr. Hiratsuka's basement studio. At 5 p.m., 516 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 529-5660; donation suggested. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tuesday through Thursday) The company opens its two-month spring season with the first of six performances that will pay tribute to the centenary of Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of City Ballet with George Balanchine, and the founder and longtime director of the School of American Ballet. Eight of the 10 tribute ballets, all choreographed by Balanchine, will be presented in three programs this week, including ''The Four Temperaments,'' ''Pavane,'' ''Agon,'' ''Symphony in C,'' ''Concerto Barocco,'' ''Duo Concertant,'' ''Square Dance'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements.'' Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570; (800) 580-8730, nycballet.com; $15 to $95. (Dunning) * Stephen Petronio Company (Tuesday through Thursday) Stephen Petronio has a reputation for making provocative, sexually charged dances, but his work can often be as much about identity as about sexuality. A new solo, ''For Today I Am a Boy,'' is set to the music of the avant-garde British singer Antony, and seems set to explore such issues. Also on the program are another new piece, ''Without You II''; a revival of Mr. Petronio's 1997 ''ReBourne''; ''The Ship Song,'' (part of a work made in 2003 for the Sydney Dance company); and last year's enjoyable ''Bud Suite.'' Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $40; $30 for Joyce members. (Roslyn Sulcas) PMT SHOWCASE (Tomorrow and Sunday) The program will feature dance by David Kieffer, Kai Kleinbard, Yesid Lopez, Ami Mattison, Brenda Neville and Pavan Thimmaiah, the hip-hopster who produced the showcase. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Martin Luther King Jr. High School, 122 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 924-5694; $16; $10 for students. (Dunning) QUEENS THEATER ASIAN CULTURAL FESTIVAL: KUN-YANG LIN/DANCERS (Tonight) Mr. Lin is one of many Asian crossover choreographers, but his distinctive blend of traditional and Western dance has the dark, bold force of a woodcut print. At 8, Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 760-0064, queenstheatre.org; $28; $26 for 65+; $20 for students. (Dunning) WORKS AND PROCESS AT THE GUGGENHEIM: 'SLOW DANCING' (Sunday and Monday) Subtitled ''Motion Portraits of Dancers,'' this program of larger-than-life, slow-motion video portraits by David Michalek will focus on dancers including Desmond Richardson, Wendy Whelan and Herman Cornejo, with a panel discussion including Mr. Michalek and Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center Festival. At 7:30 p.m., Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587, worksandprocess.org. On Sunday: $24, $20 for members and 65+., $15 for students. Monday is sold out. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin. Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. If the show reveals some of Durand's weaknesses -- repetitive themes and borrowings from other artists -- it also reveals his strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers raking and reaping grain, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Glueck) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. And it covers an unusually broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Holland Cotter) The Jewish Museum: Dateline: Israel: 'New Photography and Video Art,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter) * the Metropolitan Museum of Art : 'Journeys: Mapping the Earth and Mind in Chinese Art,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * the met: 'Venice and the Islamic World, 828-1797,' through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter) Museum of Contemporary American Diasporan Arts: 'Postmillennial Black Madonna,' through May 13. This group show of young artists takes various approaches to the female figure as myth and symbol in contemporary African-American cultures. 80 Hanson Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492. A complementary show is at the Skylight Gallery of the Restoration Plaza, 1368 Fulton Street, third floor, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 636-6976, through May 5, mocada.org or postbme.com. (Cotter) * Museum of Modern Art: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org (Roberta Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Taryn Simon,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Bridget Goodbody) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * Nancy Brooks Brody Some of the abstract ''paintings'' in this beautiful, reticent solo show have been stitched with cotton thread onto paper, creating patterns of linear ridges. Others are made from painstakingly detailed pencil patterns on plaster. The effect is like having Agnes Martin's bars and bands transmitted as sound waves, a soft, vibrant humming. Ms. Brody's sculptures of stacked bars of bath soap, used but not used up, are right in the poetic picture. Virgil de Voldère Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Room 416, (212) 343-9694, virgilgallery.com, through April 28. (Cotter) * WALTER DE MARIA Counting and space -- important to both Minimal and Conceptual Art -- come together with unusual clarity, if a bit too much in the way of gleaming metal, in two large installations by the creator of ''The Lightning Field'' earthwork. Both pieces consist of several dozen shiny meter-long stainless-steel rods presented in spaces that couldn't be much more pristine. Experience the spatial levitation and note the number of sides on the rods; in both cases, they increase row by row. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, and 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com, through May 5. (Smith) * JONATHAN MONK: 'SOME KIND OF GAME BETWEEN THIS AND THAT' As usual, this Conceptually inclined Scottish artist concentrates on sly tributes to, or plays on, works by other artists, among them Bruce Nauman, Chris Burden, John Baldessari and René Magritte. The slightest pieces are best, including drawings done on old books and ''The Cheat,'' in which ''this'' and ''that'' consist of an early silent film accompanied by a boom box tuned to a classical music station. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com, through May 5.(Smith) Galleries: Other 'Gifts of the Forest: Native Traditions in Wood and Bark' Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, ubs.com, through April 27. (Glueck) Last Chance * Chelsea Art Museum: 'DANGEROUS BEAUTY' A somewhat timely update of a well-worn idea, this show of contemporary works in a variety of mediums by 18 artists examines the beauty myth in art, advertising and the fashion industry. Eloquent but blunt imagery of anorexic girls, chiseled male beefcake and close-ups of surgically deformed faces predominates, reminding us of the violent extremes to which some people will go in pursuit of society's ideal of beauty and a designer body. The rest of the show -- often pointing an accusatory finger at skinny models, cosmetic labels and the mass media -- feels familiar in its critique, but the basic premise about the ideology of beauty in our culture is beyond argument. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719, chelseaartmuseum.org., closes tomorrow. (Benjamin Genocchio) * JOAN JONAS An extraordinary double show from a performance-installation-video artist who emerged in the late 1960s and has only gotten better. The centerpiece is a walk-in-collage of sculpture, props and video projections derived from a new performance work, ''The Shape, the Scent, the Feel of Things,'' accompanied by a film of the performance. Based on a memoir by the art historian Aby Warburg, and accompanied by music composed and played by the jazz pianist Jason Moran, it combines a Fluxus playfulness with task-oriented gestures of early '70s dance to achieve a mysterious visual poetry reminiscent of Joseph Cornell, decanted. Yvon Lambert New York, 550 West 21st Street and 564 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-3611, yvon-lambert.com; closes on Thursday. (Smith) * National Academy Museum: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975 Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this brave if confused exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show's 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins, mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * 'PAINTINGS, FLAGS & IRON: HAITIAN ART FROM THE LAST FIFTY YEARS' This splendid exhibition offers total immersion in the originality and continued vitality of Haiti's self-taught artists. Works by well-known painters like Hector Hyppolite, Toussaint Auguste and Rigaud Benoit range across religion, history and everyday themes. They include still lifes, landscapes and Pierre Joseph Valcin's enthralling rendering of a maternity ward. The forged and welded sculptures of Georges Liautaud and Gabriel Bien-Aimé are on a par with Bill Traylor's antic silhouette drawings. And there are no words for the extravagantly sequined and beaded flags depicting Voodoo spirits and saints, except fabulous. Edward Thorp Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6565, edwardthorpgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)",

The board of the Time-Life Alumni Society is saddened by the recent death of a former board member, Charles Bear. A graduate of Grinnell College, he later received a Masters in international relations from Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. This lead to an executive career in Time Inc., with an early focus on the international expansion of the company. After World War II, as head of Time's international operations, he was based in Paris where he managed the distribution of magazines in 40 countries. When he was seized and held captive by the Russians for four days, he emerged unharmed, except, as he later reported, ''for an overexposure to sauerkraut soup.'' At age 45 he was named managing director of Time Life International, and later he was a key officer of Fortune and Architectural Forum Back in the United Stated. He capped his magazine career as a group vice-president and secretary of Time, Inc., and he became the company's chief administrative officer. He was a member of the U.S Olympic Committee, and he was a consultant to the Commissioner of Baseball. Charles' business wit was legendary. He was a man of few words or many words depending on the occasion. For example, when he recommended to the Time Inc board that a small chain of weeklies be divested, he cogently summarized his judgement with these words: ''...(This company) is something of an appendage to the corporation, a vestigial tail that the dog wouldn't bother to wag if he could.'' He will be missed by his former colleagues for his wit and charm, but he will also be remembered for his brilliant hard-nosed leadership in the world-wide expansion of Time Inc.

Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'AS YET THOU ART YOUNG AND RASH' An abstract collage of shards of feeling built out of Euripides' ''Suppliant Women,'' this meditation on grief and the death of children in senseless war offers plenty of parallels to current society without doing anything so obvious as explicitly referring to them. The five-member cast, led by three beautiful middle-aged women, is strong; the director, David Herskovits, has helped them shape an evocative piece that might be too nonliteral for some tastes, but is both moving and distinctive (1:10). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GET YOUR WAR ON' Based on the absurdist comic strip of David Rees, this sardonic history lesson of the past six years will delight Bush-haters (1:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'RIDDLELIKELOVE (WITH A SIDE OF KETCHUP)' This one-woman show, in which Julie Fitzpatrick tells of her friendship with a deaf woman, is cloying and thin, but the sign-language interpretation provided at each performance gives it an interesting extra dimension, helping to bring the subject to life (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'THE SCENE' Theresa Rebeck's latest is a sharp-witted, sharp-elbowed comedy about the savage economies of sex and show business in Manhattan. Tony Shalhoub plays an out-of-work actor, Charlie, happily married -- but not really -- to Patricia Heaton's frazzled chat show booker. Enter femme fatale Clea, played by the gifted Anna Camp, and goodbye, Charlie (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood) * 'TOYS IN THE ATTIC' Austin Pendleton's fine revival of Lillian Hellman's last play faithfully attacks the corrosive attachments of family. What good is a family, and thus a society, the play implicitly asks, that can only look in the mirror? (2:30) Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Ginia Bellafante) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'THE VIETNAMIZATION OF NEW JERSEY (AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY)' A revival of Christopher Durang's satire of war, family life and Bicentennial fever, on the 30th anniversary of its debut at the Yale Repertory Theater, swishes along at the speed of a Nascar race. Blanche Baker is a gem as an out-of-it 1970s matron who just can't dust off the Eisenhower era. the Beckett Theater, on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'FLUKE' A meditative collage of enigmatic riffs on ''Moby-Dick'' presented by the rambunctious experimental company Radiohole (1:30). Collapsable Hole, 146 Metropolitan Avenue, at Berry Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-2251. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'PURITY' The provocateur Thomas Bradshaw's horror show confronts black-on-black racism (1:15). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Tuesday. (Zinoman) 'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'PARTY TIME' This multimedia work by the Talking Band looks great, but it's really just a reworking of the old two-guys-in-a-foxhole plot. Here the foxhole is a tank in a desert war; its two occupants (Will Badgett and Joe Roseto) sing about their lives and fears as they try to find a rendezvous point. It's visceral without being illuminating (1:00). LaMaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'THE RAPTURE PROJECT' Marionettes of various faiths clash in this confusing modern take on an old brand of Sicilian puppet theater by Great Small Works. A Susan Sontag puppet makes an appearance, as does one that calls to mind a former New York City police commissioner, but more often than not, the musical accompaniment is the liveliest thing about the show (1:30). The Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'YOU BELONG TO ME: DEATH OF NATIONS, PART V' The fifth, choppily considered installment of the writer and director Josh Fox's millennial play cycle examines the final days of three wars. Should we think about war primarily in terms of the havoc it wreaks on love and sex? He seems to think so (3:00). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Tuesday. (Bellafante) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'ABDUCTION: THE MEGUMI YOKOTA STORY' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Japanese) This documentary about the titular 13-year-old girl -- who vanished on the way home from school in Niigata, Japan, in 1977, and was revealed as a pawn in a North Korean spy-training program -- succeeds as a true crime story, a thumbnail history of a painful recent chapter of Asian history and as a portrait of lives transformed by trauma. Meandering in places, but compassionate and engrossing throughout. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'ALPHA DOG' (R, 117 minutes) Based on a true Southern California crime, Nick Cassavetes's entertaining exploitation flick features a lot of attractive, talented young actors shimmying across the screen while embodying the collective parental nightmare. Do you know where your children are? Well, in this film they're getting busy, chilling out, smoking blunts and chugging coolers faster than a toothless wino. Oh, and committing murder. (Manohla Dargis) 'ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES' (PG, 94 minutes) Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy (Freddie Highmore) who shrinks to microscopic size to find some gems and his missing grandfather. Lots of famous names (Madonna, Robert De Niro, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg) lend their voices to the computerized part of the movie, but only briefly near the end does everything click. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Dargis) * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis) 'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott) * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis) 'CODE NAME: THE CLEANER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) Cedric the Entertainer clogs the arteries of what could have been a savvy riff on the ''Bourne'' films with way too much ham, playing a janitor who wakes up with amnesia, a dead man beside him. A missing computer chip fuels the plot, aided by Lucy Liu and Nicollette Sheridan. Though it's all too dumb to amuse grownups, it's harmless fun for tweener types. (Genzlinger) 'COMEDY OF POWER' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) Isabelle Huppert is brisk and fierce as a French investigative judge going after corrupt fat cats. The director, Claude Chabrol, is more interested in the forms of ruling-class behavior than in the details of high-level criminality, but his detached, complacent style makes for an interesting contrast with Ms. Huppert's conviction. (Scott) 'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'FREEDOM WRITERS' (PG-13, 123 minutes) Hilary Swank uses her characteristic neediness to fine effect in a true-to-life story about a teacher making a difference in a Southern California high school. The writer and director Richard LaGravenese provides the smartly laid foundation, but it's the kids who give the film its strong emotional tug. (Dargis) * 'GOD GREW TIRED OF US' (PG, 90 minutes) This sober, uplifting documentary, which won two major awards at last year's Sundance Film Festival, follows the resettlement in the United States of three Sudanese young men uprooted as children by the civil war. Handsomely photographed, and inspirational but not cloyingly so, it is the rare contemporary documentary that doesn't leave a residue of cynicism and outrage. (Stephen Holden) 'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis) 'GURU' (No rating, 166 minutes, in Hindi) The Tamil director Mani Ratnam makes the case for India's growing economic clout with this entertaining epic about the rise and rise of Gurukant Desai, a fictitious Mumbai polyester manufacturer. The actress Aishwarya Rai, as Guru's wife, is a welcome presence, but the picture belongs to Abhishek Bachchan, who gives a rich, varied performance in the title role. (Andy Webster) 'HAPPILY N'EVER AFTER' (PG, 87 minutes) Like Dreamworks's ''Shrek'' comedies, ''Happily'' is a grab-bag parody set in a fantasyland derived from bedtime stories and Disney films. The adopted chambermaid Ella (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar, drawn like Winona Ryder) and the poor dishwasher Rick (Freddie Prinze Jr.) battle Ella's wicked stepmother, Frieda (Sigourney Weaver). Despite self-aware touches, this is another tired kidsploitation product in which a wasp-waisted ingénue and a shallow beau drive the plot and live happily ever after. (Seitz) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) 'MISS POTTER' (PG, 92 minutes) In ''Miss Potter,'' Renée Zellweger, her face pickled in cheeriness, is Beatrix Potter, the creator of Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin and Mrs. Tittlemouse, among other beloved characters in children's literature. As portrayed by Ms. Zellweger, Potter is almost as chipper as Julie Andrews's Mary Poppins, a proto-feminist, proto-environmentalist and perfect lady to boot. There was plenty of drama in Potter's life, but the movie turns major conflicts and losses into minor setbacks in a charmed, entirely virtuous life. The movie is far too nice for its own good. (Holden) 'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' (PG, 108 minutes) In this chaotic, overstuffed family comedy, Ben Stiller is a night watchman at the American Museum of Natural History, where the exhibits come to life at night and attack him and one another. This computerized spectacle spares no expense, but the storytelling is weak, and the hit-or-miss jokes miss more than hit. (Holden) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zoë Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis) 'PRIMEVAL' (R, 94 minutes) A giant crocodile named Gustave terrorizes Western journalists in war-torn Burundi. Not as much fun as it might have been, but not as terrible either. (Scott) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning, Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden) 'STOMP THE YARD' (PG-13, 109 minutes) Brotherhood is powerful in this sometimes compelling, sometimes complacent movie about stepping and African-American fraternity life at an Atlanta institution called Truth University. DJ (Columbus Short), a street-style dancer, needs to find his place in a university ruled by Gammas and Thetas and stepping. (Rachel Saltz) 'TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Thai) A western weepie from Thailand, filmed in garish color. In spite of the relentless genre pastiche, it has a charming sincerity. (Scott) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) 'WE ARE MARSHALL' (PG, 128 minutes) This fact-based story of a West Virginia college town recovering from the death of its entire football team in a 1970 plane crash is a stiff, manipulative dud that gets wrong everything ''Friday Night Lights'' got right. Matthew McConaughey hams it up as the college's goofy new coach, who whips the replacement team into decent shape. (Holden) Film Series ROBERT ALTMAN REMEMBERED (Tonight through Tuesday) A tribute to the late American filmmaker winds up with several seldom seen Altman films: ''Three Women,'' ''Buffalo Bill and the Indians,'' ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller,'' ''Tanner '88,'' ''Health,'' ''A Wedding,'' ''Secret Honor'' and ''Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean.'' IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Dave Kehr) CRITICS CHOICE: GREAT DOCUMENTARIES (Tomorrow and Sunday) A series of significant documentaries chosen and introduced by members of the New York Film Critics Circle continues this weekend. Matt Zoller Seitz, who contributes to The New York Times and publishes The House Next Door Web site, is joined by the director Albert Maysles tomorrow for a screening of Mr. Maysles's 1968 cinéma-verité study ''Salesman,'' and Stuart Klawans of The Nation on Sunday presents Nora Jacobson's hard look at real estate development in Hoboken, N.J., ''Delivered Vacant.'' (Through Feb. 25.) Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) GLOBAL LENS 2007 (Tonight through Thursday) A continuing program of 10 feature films from developing countries, sponsored by the Global Film Initiative. This week's offerings include Li Yu's Chinese film ''Dam Street,'' about the friendship between a washed-up opera singer and a 10-year-old child, which concludes an extended run, with screenings tonight through Monday. On Thursday there's the Kurdistan-French co-production ''Kilometre Zero,'' a story of the ethnic conflict between Kurds and Iraqis set during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, written and directed by Hiner Saleem. (Through Jan. 28.) Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) KEN AND AZAZEL JACOBS (Tonight through Tuesday) Anthology Film Archives is holding the premiere engagements of two new films from the avant-garde eminence Ken Jacobs (whose epic exercise in associative editing, ''Star Spangled to Death,'' has recently been released on DVD) and Azazel Jacobs, a son of Mr. Jacobs who is following in his father's footsteps. ''The Goodtimeskid,'' is by the younger Mr. Jacobs and is a 77-minute color feature that follows two men with the same name and a woman involved with them both over the course of 24 hours in Los Angeles. ''Two Wrenching Departures,'' by the senior Mr. Jacobs, is a black-and-white video piece. First produced as a live performance, it is about two of Mr. Jacobs's friends, the underground filmmakers Jack Smith (''Flaming Creatures'') and Bob Fleischner (''Banners''), who died within a week of each other in October 1989. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * 'THE AMERICAN BEAUTY PROJECT' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Grateful Dead had its origins in the folk revival, but it took a while for the band to find the right balance between long-form psychedelic jams and small-scale, acoustic country-folk. A diverse group of musicians gathers this weekend to pay tribute to the Dead's two eureka albums from 1970. Performing songs from ''Workingman's Dead'' tomorrow are the Klezmatics, Ollabelle, the Holmes Brothers, Jim Lauderdale, Larry Campbell and Tim O'Reagan of the Jayhawks. Playing from ''American Beauty'' on Sunday are Mark Eitzel, Jay Farrar, Espers, Toshi Reagon, Jorma Kaukonen, Dar Williams, Mr. Lauderdale, Ollabelle and Mr. Campbell. Tony Trischka and Andy Statman play instrumental interludes. At 8 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Ben Sisario) ARAMIRÈ (Tonight) This folk ensemble from the Salento region of Italy is dedicated to one of the lesser-known traditions of the country, the Greek-influenced music of the southeast of Italy's ''heel.'' With strings, accordion, flute and lots of tambourine, it pays particular attention to the pizzica, a galloping six-beat dance related to the tarantella and long used as a faith-healing cure for spider bites. At 8:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Sisario) * CAMERA OBSCURA (Wednesday) Like their fellow Glaswegians Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, led by the expressively plain-voiced Tracyanne Campbell, is in love with wistful 1960s folk-pop and plays a country-leaning variation on it with taste and finesse. With the Essex Green. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $15.50 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) * KRISTIN CHENOWETH (Tonight) This Tony Award-winning treasure plays the Metropolitan Opera House; she's only the third musical-theater person the Met has ever presented in a solo gig. Appearing with a 12-piece orchestra and dancers, she is to add some opera arias to her usual repertory. At 8, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $50 to $200. (Sisario) CLIPSE (Wednesday) Comeback stories are rare and sweet in rap. In 2002 this Virginia duo rose all the way to No. 4 with sly rhymes about the criminal life and brutally minimal rhythm tracks by the Neptunes. Since then the Clipse struggled in music-industry purgatory but triumphed with ''Hell Hath No Fury'' (Re-Up Gang/Jive), another cold, lean and virtuosic exercise that was one of the best hip-hop albums of 2006. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) COLD WAR KIDS (Wednesday) The craggy guitars, verge-of-a-breakdown vocals and elliptical songwriting of this band from Austin, Tex., put it at the top of the music-blogger food chain last year. Now comes the hard part: maintaining popularity as the Internet eye roves again. This month the band is bouncing back and forth between New York and Los Angeles each week in a ''bicoastal residency.'' With Illinois and the Virgins. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) MARK EITZEL (Tonight) Depression is Mr. Eitzel's element; as leader of the American Music Club and through a solo career, he has anatomized melancholy down to the molecular level. In a weary voice, with tunes that blur folk songs and torch songs in a smoky haze, he looks at estrangement and betrayal, loneliness and separation, and bad luck. At 8, Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $12. (Jon Pareles) DIAMANDA GALÁS (Sunday) Though she is invariably dressed in black, with her face in witchy streaks of makeup, Ms. Galás needs only her voice to terrify and seduce. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory that ranges from Johnny Cash ballads to her own chilling AIDS Masses. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Sisario) * GLOBALFEST (Sunday) A one-night crash course in some of the best of what is called world music only because there is no other name for it, Globalfest, now in its fourth year, offers a dozen performers from around the planet. Among them, performing on three stages, are the suave Brazilian songwriter Lenine; Dengue Fever, a band from Los Angeles that resurrects the manically eclectic rock of pre-Khmer Rouge Cambodia; Les Primitifs du Futur, a French retro jazz-blues-Gypsy string band; Sara Tavares, a sensuous Cape Verdean singer; Lila Downs, whose take on Mexican rancheras and cumbias can be raucous or reverent; Le Trio Joubran, three oud-playing Palestinian brothers; and Andy Palacio and the Garifuna Collective, from Belize. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com or globalfest-ny.org; $40. (Sisario) GOB IRON (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jay Farrar of Son Volt and Anders Parker of Varnaline have built careers on the idea of ragged, rock-tinged roots music: a little less grungy than Neil Young, a bit more plebeian than Bob Dylan. On ''Death Songs for the Living'' (Transmit Sound/Legacy), their joint album as Gob Iron, they repaint centuries of American music by the Carter Family, Josh White and Stephen Foster in gray, bleak tones; even Clarence Ashley's sprightly ''Coo-Coo Bird'' gets a despondent rewrite. Tonight at 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; tomorrow at 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15. (Sisario) PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive curriculum at his Philadelphia school, teaching youngsters the rock 'n' roll canon, as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. Here his students offer their tribute to Black Sabbath, and if there is any guitar riff especially appropriate for 12-year-olds, it's ''Iron Man.'' At 2:30 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $10. (Sisario) HOLMES BROTHERS AND ALLEN TOUSSAINT (Tuesday) Steeped in blues and gospel, Sherman and Wendell Holmes harmonize and raise the rafters with songs that draw hope from hard times. Their version of gospel is a close neighbor of Southern soul and country. They are joined by Allen Toussaint, the musical statesman from New Orleans, for two sets. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Pareles) JERRY LEE LEWIS (Tonight) People pounded on pianos and hollered about hellfire before Jerry Lee Lewis, but nobody put it together in quite his way, which is the rock 'n' roll way. Now 71, Mr. Lewis recently released his first new album in 11 years, ''Last Man Standing'' (Artist First), which features appearances by the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Eric Clapton, all happily overshadowed. With Jack Grace. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $90. (Sisario) LIGHTNING BOLT (Sunday) At first it is hard to believe that all the glorious chaos of Lightning Bolt -- a stalwart of the big noise-punk scene in Providence, R.I. -- is being made by only two people. But as the sound comes into focus, a playful give-and-take becomes clear, as the bassist Brian Gibson and the drummer and vocalist Brian Chippendale toss back and forth gigantic metal riffs and giggly high notes, creating rainbows of dissonance. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10. (Sisario) LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Tonight and tomorrow night) Now in its ninth season, this series has greatly expanded from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like. Tonight the Broadway soprano Judy Kuhn offers songs by Laura Nyro, who, along with Joni Mitchell, established the model for confessional, force-of-nature women's songwriting. Tomorrow Michael Franks plays his own music, including recent Brazilian-inspired works. At 8:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; sold out. (Sisario) LUNA LOUNGE (Tonight and tomorrow night) For a decade beginning in 1995, the Luna Lounge was one of the better rock dives on the Lower East Side, and not just for its foosball table; its tiny back room was host to thousands of bands who played free, including some, like Interpol and the Strokes, who went on to bigger things. A year and a half after losing its lease, the club reopens with roomier digs in Brooklyn, and if the bookings are any indication, the indie tradition will continue even if the no-cover policy will not. The Comas, a band from North Carolina with psychedelic leanings, headlines tonight with Falcon, from Brooklyn. Tomorrow features three appropriately little-known New York bands, Orange Park, the Picture and Motel Creeps. At 8, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, lunalounge.com; $10 tonight, $5 tomorrow. (Sisario) HUGH MASEKELA, KLEZMATICS (Sunday) The South African flugelhorn player Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zigzagging possibilities of jazz. The Klezmatics love the laughing, moaning melodies of traditional klezmer music. They also love jazz, rock and downtown improvisation, and they bring all those styles to bear on their music, which can be raucous, hypnotic, reverent and dizzying, sometimes all in one quick-changing piece. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) ERIN McKEOWN (Tuesday and Wednesday) A smiley sprite whose knack for wordplay and light touch on the guitar have sometimes evoked Tin Pan Alley, Ms. McKeown took the plunge in her new album, ''Sing You Sinners'' (Nettwerk), recording 12 nuggets by Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Fats Waller and others (along with one by herself). If her voice is not quite up to the subtleties of wit the songs demand, her joy of discovery is sincere. With Sean Hayes. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Wednesday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) MEXICAN INSTITUTE OF SOUND (Tomorrow) A one-man mash-up of Mexican and Latin American music of the past and perhaps the future, Camilo Lara, from Mexico City, artfully mingles cumbias and cha-chas with dub and slippery electronica. Like Moby, he spins a dream of groovy eternal life through sounds that retain their kitsch and dance potential forever. With the Gritty Midi Gang. At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $10. (Sisario) * MISSION OF BURMA (Tonight) In the early 1980s this innovative and widely influential Boston band brought sharp, brainy guitar minimalism to American postpunk, and since reuniting in 2002 after almost 20 years, it still plays with passion and smarts. Here the band appears with two worthy descendants: Oneida and Turing Machine, both of Brooklyn. At 8, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) ANDERS PARKER (Wednesday) Mr. Parker, who led the band Varnaline, immerses his songs in the stoic drama of country and folk music, resulting in a melancholy that is sometimes indistinguishable from cynicism. (''The hours I've wasted here I could have wasted anywhere.'') At 9 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) BOB SEGER AND THE SILVER BULLET BAND (Thursday) In the fall Mr. Seger released ''Face the Promise'' (Capitol), his first new album in a decade. It's O.K., but a better illustration of what remains powerful in Mr. Seger's music was his performance of ''America the Beautiful'' at Game 1 of the last World Series: in a tender, soulful rasp, he evoked rock's gospel roots, and made a simple patriotic ode bring a stadium roaring to its feet. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $79.50. (Sisario) * RICKY SKAGGS WITH BRUCE HORNSBY (Sunday) One of the most virtuosic musicians in bluegrass, Ricky Skaggs sends his fingers flying in a blur over mandolin, guitar and fiddle. He performs with Bruce Hornsby, whose years playing with the Grateful Dead made him a more versatile and playful musician. The two of them have a new album, due in March, that looks particularly versatile and playful: they do a version of Rick James's ''Super Freak.'' Sunday's concert also features opening sets by Shawn Colvin and Paul Thorn. At 7:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $55 in advance, $60 at the door. (Sisario) SUBDUDES (Tomorrow) The Subdudes, from New Orleans, make cozy, mostly unplugged roots-rock: straightforward sentiments in tunes that mix a little country, a little blues, a little soul, a little zydeco and a little swing. The group's original lineup disbanded in 1996, but three founding members have revived the band and since 2004 released two new albums. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles) ZS (Sunday and Monday) The Zs, one of the most active avant-rock groups in New York, plays kinetic pieces that sputter forth in Morse code dots of percussion and saxophone. On Monday it plays with Dave Longstreth, whose band Dirty Projectors constructs elaborate ''glitch operas'' with precise harmonies and stark pluckings of guitar and strings, all arranged slightly out of whack. Sunday at 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. Monday at 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934, zebuloncafeconcert.com; no cover. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. AMPERSAND/KNEEBODY (Tuesday) The guitarist Tim Ziesmer features his own rock-influenced compositions in Ampersand, with Chris Speed on tenor saxophone, Dave Ambrosio on bass and Ted Poor on drums. Kneebody, a collective that includes the keyboardist Adam Benjamin and the trumpeter Shane Endsley, convincingly blends rock, funk and soul in a rugged and exploratory modern fusion. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $12. (Nate Chinen) * THE BAD PLUS (Tuesday through Thursday) The pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer David King constitute the Bad Plus, a delivery system for smartly sweeping original songs as well as wryly affectionate renditions of pop tunes. They caused a stir among jazz purists when they first headlined at the Village Vanguard a few years ago; by now the engagement has become a happy ritual, and the band has nothing to prove but its own continuing vitality. (Through Jan. 28.) At 9 and 11 p.m. (with a 12:30 set on Jan. 27), Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) SAM BARDFELD (Tonight) Mr. Bardfeld, a violinist with a wide-ranging résumé, revisits the music from his evocative recent album ''Periodic Trespasses (The Saul Cycle)'' (Fresh Sound New Talent). At 9 p.m., BAMcafé, 30 Lafayette Avenue, between Ashland Place and St. Felix Street, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; no cover. (Chinen) * DON BYRON (Monday) Jazz has many card-carrying eclectics these days, but none more self-assured than the clarinetist Don Byron, who will match wits with two very different pianists: Ursula Oppens, a classical interpreter known for the range of her interests, and Kenny Barron, an improviser with a soulfully sophisticated style. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $25 in advance, $30 on Monday. (Chinen) ROBERTO CARCASSES, DAFNIS PRIETO, YOSVANY TERRY AND YUNIOR TERRY (Tomorrow) Cuban folk tradition collides with contemporary jazz protocol in a group featuring Mr. Carcasses on keyboards, Mr. Prieto on drums and the Terry brothers, Yosvany and Yunior, on saxophone and bass respectively. At 10 and 11:30 p.m., Rose Live Music, 345 Grand Street, between Havemeyer and Marcy Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-0069, liveatrose.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) JIMMY COBB'S MOB (Tuesday and Wednesday) Jimmy Cobb, a masterful hard bop drummer, has served as a mentor to many young musicians through this band; one of them, the tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, takes the melodic lead here. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) STEVE COLEMAN (Tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Mr. Coleman, the avant-garde alto saxophonist and composer, programmed this month's schedule at the Stone, leaving a handful of spaces for his own explorations. Tomorrow he convenes a group called Aquarius Ingress consisting of seven reed players, including the saxophonist Miguel Zenón and the clarinetist Chris Speed; on Sunday and Thursday he leads Five Elements, his adventurously funk-focused working band. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'ACIS AND GALATEA' (Tuesday) Staged opera or home entertainment? Handel's early pastoral opera has been the subject of debate since it was written. Probably first performed for a private group at a country estate, it was later revived as a staged opera by another manager eager to capitalize on Handel's Italian-opera success -- in competition with Handel's own opera company. Now, New York, having experienced the work on an operatic scale in City Opera's 2001 production, can sample it in a more intimate form: presented by the five-member Aulos Ensemble (acclaimed early-music specialists) and four vocal soloists at the Met -- not the opera, but the museum. At 6:30 p.m., Medieval Sculpture Hall, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. (Anne Midgette) 'LA BOHÈME' (Wednesday) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Bohème'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera for its first airing of the new year, and the Chilean soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs returns to sing Mimì, the role with which she made her house debut in 1996. Her Rodolfo is the excellent tenor Marcello Giordani; they both have the vocal and dramatic chops to make an impact in Zeffirelli's massive sets. Ainhoa Arteta is Musetta, Dwayne Croft is Marcello, and Carlo Rizzi conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 tickets remaining. (Vivien Schweitzer) 'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Monday and Thursday) The excitement of a world premiere at the Met, combined with widespread interest among the general public in the composer Tan Dun, who won an Oscar for his film score to ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' have resulted in a sold-out run for ''The First Emperor.'' Alas, though the story of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who unified the country through brutality and conquest, is compelling, Mr. Tan's ponderous score is a huge disappointment. There are gripping moments, especially some propulsive orchestra passages that incorporate Chinese instruments. But the opera's lyrical flights are slow-moving, ponderous and sometimes cloying. Mr. Tan has tried to meld Chinese melody and Italianate lyricism. But his music seems caught in some nowhere land between ''Crouching Tiger'' and Puccini's ''Turandot.'' Even the great Plácido Domingo, bravely taking on the challenging title role, cannot save the show. The colorful production is by the Chinese film director Zhang Yimou (''House of Flying Daggers''). Mr. Tan conducts. There are two more performances. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'MOSTLY OPERETTA' (Tonight, tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) The Austrian Cultural Forum's innovative festival, which pairs 20th-century operetta in intimate recitals with contemporary visuals in an effort to move the genre into the 21st century, winds up this week with three programs by Viennese singers who specialize in operetta: two programs that pay homage to some composers forced to emigrate by the Nazis, and a selection of Kurt Weill's songs arranged into what the forum's director calls ''a kind of 'Winterreise.' '' At 7 p.m, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; free, but reservations are required. (Midgette) * 'IL SIGNOR BRUSCHINO' (Thursday) Mention Rossini and most people come up with ''The Barber of Seville,'' but this work -- in which the composer honed the comic gift that came to the fore in ''Barber'' and other ''opere buffe'' -- hasn't been staged in New York since 1933. The Gotham Chamber Opera has set itself apart among the city's small opera companies with quality performances of less-known operas (with good singers), conducted by the company's founder, Neal Goren: it is opening this frothy piece of fun with a gala performance on Thursday. (The run continues, at normal ticket prices, next week.) At 7:30 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200, gothamchamberopera.org; $300. (Midgette) 'THE TENDER LAND' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In 1976, when the enterprising Bronx Opera Company first presented Copland's ''Tender Land,'' the composer participated in rehearsals and attended productions. For its current production, the company is using the effective chamber version of the orchestral score arranged by Murry Sidlin. Royston Coppenger is the director, and Michael Spierman conducts. At 2 p.m., Heckscher Theater, El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (718) 960-8833, bronxopera.org; $20 to $35. (Tommasini) * 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tuesday) The admirable soprano Hei-Kyung Hong gives a beautifully sung and deeply felt portrayal of Violetta in the Met revival of Verdi's ''Traviata,'' in Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production. The other news is the promising performance of an artist who, like Ms. Hong, is also from South Korea: the tenor Wookyung Kim, singing Alfredo in his Met debut season. As a Verdi tenor, Mr. Kim is a little green. But he has an appealing and robust voice, and at his best, sings with ardor and flair. The baritone Charles Taylor, who was ill on opening night, is scheduled to sing Germont. Carlo Rizzi conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $175. (Tommasini) Classical Music * ALARM WILL SOUND (Tomorrow) This supremely inventive new-music ensemble offers an expansive look at the music of Edgard Varèse in Miller Theater's Composer Portraits series. Among the 10 works on the program are the early ''Grand Sommeil Noir''; ''Ionisation,'' for percussion ensemble; ''Density 21.5,'' for flute; and several orchestral works. The main curiosity, though, is an orchestrated arrangement of the ''Poème Électronique,'' which is normally heard in the electronic tape version that Varèse completed in 1958. At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25; $15 for students. (Allan Kozinn) DANIEL BARENBOIM (Tomorrow and Sunday) In a charming and revealing program note (available on carnegiehall.org), Mr. Barenboim writes of having been reared from his earliest years on Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier.'' When he arrived at 12 for his first lesson in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, this formidable teacher opened the score to the Prelude in E minor from Book 1 and told him, ''Play it for me in A minor.'' This weekend Mr. Barenboim, a formidable pianist, will play that prelude (in the original key) in his two-program survey of the complete 48 preludes and fugues from Bach's monumental work. Book 1 tomorrow at 8 p.m., Book 2 on Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34 to $108. (Tommasini) KRISTIAN BEZUIDENHOUT (Thursday) This South African fortepianist gave a fine recital at the Miller Theater in November, and returns with another program, as part of the Boston Early Music Festival's series in the Morgan Library & Museum's intimate new hall. His program includes Mozart's Sonata in F (K. 494) and Variations on ''Unser dummer Pöbel meint'' (K. 455); Benda's Sonata in A minor; and Haydn's Variations in F minor. At 7:30 p.m. (preconcert lecture at 7), Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org; $45; $35 for members. (Kozinn) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) Music for four-hand piano used to be a staple of the repertory, particularly in the days before recordings, when the way most people enjoyed music was to play it themselves. In this program seven pianists (including Charles Wadsworth, a past director of the society, and Wu Han, a current co-director, as well as Gilbert Kalish and Anne-Marie McDermott) take on works for four hands by Mozart, Mendelssohn, Fauré, Stravinsky and Lutoslawski (whose Variations on a Theme of Paganini is the only one to employ two separate pianos). Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Midgette) * 'DECASIA' (Thursday) The composer Michael Gordon and the filmmaker Bill Morrison have collaborated on this enveloping multimedia work. Mr. Morrison's contribution is a fast-cut montage of antique films, in which bubbles and other signs of decay create patterns as crucial to the work as the images of cowboys, flappers, factory workers, dancers, parachutists and exotic scenes from the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. Gordon's powerful 65-minute score -- played by an orchestra deployed in the balconies -- evolves from a faint, metallic rattle to a barrage of percussion, electric guitars, brass choirs, woodwinds and strings. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101; $25. (Kozinn) * HILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Sunday) In its performance on the Music Before 1800 series, this British vocal ensemble, here in a quartet configuration (David James, Rogers Covey-Crump, Steven Harrold and Gordon Jones), sings the Lassus Requiem, with antiphons and motets by Palestrina interposed between the movements. At 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266, mb1800.org; $25 to $40; $5 off for students and 62+. (Kozinn) KIRILL GERSTEIN (Sunday) The Metropolitan Museum presents the third of four young up-and-coming pianists in its Accolades series. This week the spotlight is on the Russian pianist Kirill Gerstein, who won first prize at the 2001 Arthur Rubinstein Piano Competition and was awarded the 2002 Gilmore Young Artist Award. He will perform Haydn's Sonata in D (Hob. XVI:37), Schumann's whimsical ''Humoresque,'' Ligeti's Études, Busoni's Sonatina No. 6 and an arrangement of the Scherzo from Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony. At 2:30 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $20. (Schweitzer) * MOSCOW SOLOISTS (Thursday) Wu Man, the fleet-fingered and adventurous Chinese pipa player, frequently adds the sound of her exotic instrument to Western ensembles. With the violist Yuri Bashmet and his Moscow Soloists (a group formed in 1992 and made up of young graduates of the Moscow Conservatory), she will perform Tan Dun's Concerto for String Orchestra and Pipa (a pipa is a Chinese lute), a work whose premiere she performed in 2001. The program also includes Toru Takemitsu's ''Nostalgia'' and his Three Film Scores for Strings, and Hikaru Hayashi's Concerto for Viola and Strings, ''Elegie.'' At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 and $40. (Schweitzer) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Thursday) Riccardo Muti, the exacting Italian maestro, is in town for two weeks to conduct the Philharmonic. This weekend's program offers the brilliant violinist Vadim Repin in Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto and Scriabin's strangely mystical and musically visionary Symphony No. 3, ''Le Divin Poème.'' On Thursday Mr. Muti presents the first of three performances of an all-Italian program, with ballet music from Verdi's ''Macbeth,'' Respighi's ''Feste Romane'' and a little-known piano concerto from 1885 by Giuseppe Martucci, a work admired by Toscanini, Mahler and, of course, Mr. Muti. Gerhard Oppitz is the soloist. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $96. (Tommasini) JORGE FEDERICO OSORIO (Monday) This Mexican pianist has recorded everything from Brahms to Ponce (and, most recently, Mozart violin sonatas with Ani Kavafian) but has only infrequently performed in New York. His solo recital juxtaposes works by two Spanish composers, Soler and Albéniz, with preludes by Debussy, showpieces by Liszt and Beethoven's Sonata No. 30. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $20 to $45. (Midgette) * 'REQUIEM FOR DARFUR' (Monday) The Democracy Council, a human-rights advocacy group, is sponsoring this performance of Verdi's magisterial Requiem by musicians from orchestras including the New York and Berlin Philharmonics and the Met and Philadelphia Orchestras. The event, which benefits Unicef and other charities involved in aid work in Darfur, has Mia Farrow as its host, and features as soloists the soprano Alexandra Deshorties, the mezzo-soprano Sarah Heltzel, the tenor Scott Piper and the bass Morris Robinson; George Mathew conducts. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $27 to $500. (Schweitzer) RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY (Tomorrow) Even by its own adventurous standards, the Riverside Symphony is offering an offbeat program tomorrow. The most eclectic item is Villa-Lobos's Harmonica Concerto. The harmonica virtuoso Robert Bonfiglio says he has performed the work more than 350 times. I've never heard it. Have you? Here is your chance, on a program that also offers Mozart's ''Haffner'' Symphony and Honegger's Neo-Classical Symphony No. 4 (''Delights of Basel''). George Rothman conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $50. (Tommasini) ABBEY SIMON (Tuesday) The Walter W. Naumburg Foundation is offering a retrospective concert series in which it presents former winners of its competition. Mr. Simon, the pianist, won in 1941, and his recordings of the Romantic repertory have always been highly regarded, with Chopin as a particular favorite. At his ''Naumburg Looks Back'' recital, he plays music of Chopin and Schumann. At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn) * 'THE SONG CONTINUES' (Tuesday through Thursday) The master classes are going to be a hotter ticket than the recitals at the Marilyn Horne Foundation's annual celebration of the art of song. Leading off at Zankel Hall is the celebrated Barbara Cook; the next night it's the soprano Evelyn Lear; on Thursday it's Ms. Horne herself. The duo recitals by young artists supported by Ms. Horne's foundation, like Joslin Romphf, a soprano, and Lee Poulis, a baritone, on Wednesday; or Hanan Alattar, a soprano, and Timothy Falton, a tenor, on Thursday, have been relegated to the 5:30 time slot at Weill Recital Hall.

(Midgette) TAKACS QUARTET (Tonight) This string quartet has undergone a few personnel changes in recent years, and in the process its sound and focus have improved considerably. A Beethoven cycle at Lincoln Center two years ago showed it to be in remarkable form. This time Takacs offers Debussy's Quartet and Shostakovich's Quartet No. 11, before returning to Beethoven for the Quartet in A minor (Op. 132). At 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $45. (Kozinn) * TOKYO STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) This venerable quartet continues its residency at the 92nd Street Y and its commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Schumann's death with a performance of his String Quartet in A minor. The program also includes Schumann's poignant song cycle ''Dichterliebe,'' sung by the fine Canadian lyric baritone Russell Braun, accompanied by the pianist Carolyn Maule. Paul Hecht, an actor, will read poems from Heinrich Heine's ''Lyrisches Intermezzo,'' on which Schumann based these songs. At 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40.

(Dunning) CHEZ BUSHWICK: 'AMBUSH: A CURE FOR APAP' (Tomorrow) Bless the Bushwickites for this shrug at the phenomenon of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters, which brings dance producers to New York City en masse to assess the talent during a hectic few days -- frustrating to some dance artists -- of conferences and performing.

(Claudia La Rocco) * LOWER LIGHTS COLLECTIVE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Members of this multimedia group have worked with some pretty impressive people in dance. And how can you go wrong with a company that describes its collaborative process as ignoring one another while allowing for the subtle influence of what is seen out of the corner of the eye? In its new ''CRAM,'' the group will pour dance; a ''live horror film''; sound and noise installations; a ''living sculpture'' using potatoes as percussion; and an orchestra of instruments made from architectural salvage into every cranny of this space.

(Dunning) * PEAK PERFORMANCES AT MONTCLAIR: TRISHA BROWN (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Brown, now 70, celebrates her influential career in modern dance with a new work, ''I love my robots,'' that suggests that she is as innovative as ever. A collaboration with the visual artist Kenjiro Okazaki and the performance artist Laurie Anderson, ''robots'' will feature what Mr. Okazaki describes as two interactive ''sculptural apparitions.'' The evening also includes performances of Ms. Brown's 1983 ''Set and Reset'' and her 2005 ''how long does the subject linger on the edge of the volume?'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 3 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org; $35. (Dunning) LAURA PETERSON CHOREOGRAPHY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Peterson, who has danced with everyone from Risa Jaroslow to Poppo and the GoGo Boys, describes her new ''I Love Dan Flavin'' as a tongue-in-cheek futuristic dance with fluorescent light and pioneering techno music.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. It covers medical innovation, military hardware, frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,' through Feb. 19. The 100 paintings and drawings on display here are by 10 artists, including George Grosz, Christian Schad, and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble; we look into the faces of museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92) portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,' through Jan. 29. This gripping show reminds us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org. (Holland Cotter) * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'KIKI SMITH: A GATHERING, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * ROBERT IRWIN: 'WHO'S AFRAID OF RED, YELLOW AND BLUE 3' In the past, Robert Irwin has paid homage to Joseph Albers. Now he makes a bow to a different kind of perceptual magician, Barnett Newman, turning Newman's 1966-70 paintings titled ''Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue'' into a kind of self-reflective architecture. Optical illusionism has long been Mr. Irwin's calling card, but here he has achieved it by bare-bones means, offering quieting visual fare for an overstimulated world. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-7000, pacewildenstein.com, through Feb. 3. (Cotter) * JAPAN, INC. See this show of work by six painters who are either Japanese or inspired by Japanese culture primarily for Iona Rozeal Brown's dynamic new canvas ''King Kata.'' Through sharpened color and scale and by taking more liberties with her sources, Ms. Brown has markedly increased the visual punch of her characteristic kimono-and-cornrows cross-cultural fusion of cartoons, Japanese woodblock actor prints and gangsta chic. Her contribution underscores the vacuousness of much contemporary realist painting. Kravets Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, through Feb. 17. (Smith) Other Galleries * 'THE CONSTANT POSSIBILITY OF ERASURE,' through Jan. 29. Organized by Donna Harkavy and Gracie Mansion, this excellent group show is at once witty and elegaic, exploring transience as an existential reality and as a conceptual ploy in late-20th-century art. Robert Rauschenberg's 1953 ''Erased De Kooning'' is an important reference point, present through Mike Bidlo's painstaking recreation. Joseph Beuys, Gary Simmons and Christian Xarec all have chalk pieces on blackboards, while Allan Kaprow preferred drawing, and simultaneously erasing, chalk pictures on the sidewalks or streets. Joanne Stamerra Hendricks uses erasers as a medium, and Jim Dingilian uses smoke. Dorsky Gallery Curatorial Projects, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-6317. (Cotter) * OLIVER HALSMAN ROSENBERG: 'DADA FOR GRANDMA,' through Jan. 28. Mr. Rosenberg conceived this show of a dozen lovely, small gouache paintings with references to the zodiac, the Kabala and Egyptian and Hindu cosmology as a tribute to his grandmother Yvonne Halsman who died last year. She was the wife of the Dada photographer Phillipe Halsman, and Dada zaniness has its part in the show. The artist has turned the paintings into an ingeniously low-tech ''prayer wheel'' set into motion by the visitor pedaling his grandmother's exercise bicycle. Mr. Rosenberg, a founder of the alternative space Triple Base in San Francisco who is, with Clint Taniguchi, half of the collaborative Crust & Dirt, has other drawings in a box at Triple Candie, worth a look. Little Cakes, 625 East Sixth Street, Apt. 1B, East Village, (646) 342-1056. (Cotter) Last Chance BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. Not surprisingly, her celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. It reduces these often vivid portrayals to the size of their natural, magazine habitat and allows the viewer to skim for the good ones, as if turning pages. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK' If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, sometimes with bits of colored glass scattered over them. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces that he artfully cut, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the city's wired energy and architectural vivacity. The two groups are united for the first time in this show, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) * THE MET: 'BRUSH AND INK: THE CHINESE ART OF WRITING' If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Cotter) EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MERENGUE: VISUAL RHYTHMS' AND 'THIS SKIN I'M IN: CONTEMPORARY DOMINICAN ART FROM EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO'S PERMANENT COLLECTION,' Although ''Merengue,'' the larger of the two shows at El Museo, is made up almost entirely of paintings, it is about music, namely the national popular music of the Dominican Republic. Most of the 40 or so pictures, dating from the 1930s to the 1990s, document the music being performed or danced to; a few seem to be formal responses to its percussive beat. In a second, smaller show, merengue's vaunted joie de vivre gets some critical prodding from artists of Dominican descent living in New York. El Museo Del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ALTERED, STITCHED AND GATHERED' Art by users might be the subtitle here, given that the show's 26 artists operate in the capacious gap between modernist assemblage and postmodern appropriation. Everything from e-mail messages to Wal-Mart plastic hangers and the movie ''Rambo'' are reused, often to comment on history, consumerism and war. Earlier efforts by Yoko Ono, Ben Vautier and Jaques Villeglé provide background. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org, closes on Tuesday. (Smith) * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD' This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)",

Fells Davis and Morris H. Green. His untimely passing on February 10, 2007, at the age 34, occurred in his beloved community of Greenwich Village in New York City. Corey attended Fessenden School in Massachusetts, and Loomis Chaffee in Connecticut, where he balanced academics and athletics. Corey played tennis, basketball, and was the captain of the soccer and lacrosse teams at Loomis Chaffee. His exceptional skill in soccer led to an invitation to try out for the U.S. soccer team. In 1995, Corey earned a Bachelor of Science Degree at the University of Vermont in Burlington. While at the University of Vermont, he performed with a professional band where he played trap drums. Throughout his life music was important. At the time of his death, Corey was employed by Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc., as a Senior Vice President of Institutional Investments in New York City. The impact of his life goes beyond his accomplishments as a Senior Vice President for institutional investments, musician, and athlete. Perhaps Corey's greatest gift is that he inspired and connected others. Some people create deals, but Corey created relationships by connecting his diverse friends to each other. With a kind word for everyone and the ability to make everyone laugh, the flame that Corey lit will continue to burn. His dedication and commitment to family and friends, generosity, intelligence, integrity, passion, and professional advancement showed a true leader. He is survived by his parents. He is also survived by his stepfather, Johnny Davis; maternal grandmother, Minnie Fells; paternal grandmothers, Elizabeth Green and Charlotte Green; sisters, Amanda and Madison Green; brother, Gannon Green; aunts, Gayle Green Taylor and Gina Green; cousins, Ernest Rollins, Mary ''Lolli'' Houston, and Izell Fells; countless grandaunts and cousins; his godmother, Wilmer Hill Grier; and the love of his life, soul mate, and companion, Salome Makonnen.

The board of the Time-Life Alumni Society is saddened by the recent death of a former board member, Charles Bear. A graduate of Grinnell College, he later received a Masters in international relations from Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. This lead to an executive career in Time Inc., with an early focus on the international expansion of the company. After World War II, as head of Time's international operations, he was based in Paris where he managed the distribution of magazines in 40 countries. When he was seized and held captive by the Russians for four days, he emerged unharmed, except, as he later reported, ''for an overexposure to sauerkraut soup.'' At age 45 he was named managing director of Time Life International, and later he was a key officer of Fortune and Architectural Forum Back in the United Stated. He capped his magazine career as a group vice-president and secretary of Time, Inc., and he became the company's chief administrative officer. He was a member of the U.S Olympic Committee, and he was a consultant to the Commissioner of Baseball. Charles' business wit was legendary. He was a man of few words or many words depending on the occasion. For example, when he recommended to the Time Inc board that a small chain of weeklies be divested, he cogently summarized his judgement with these words: ''...(This company) is something of an appendage to the corporation, a vestigial tail that the dog wouldn't bother to wag if he could.'' He will be missed by his former colleagues for his wit and charm, but he will also be remembered for his brilliant hard-nosed leadership in the world-wide expansion of Time Inc.

'DEUCE' In previews; opens on Sunday. The grandes dames Angela Lansbury and Marian Seldes play retired tennis players in this new Terrence McNally comedy. Michael Blakemore directs (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'GASLIGHT' Previews start on Wednesday. Opens on May 17. The always fascinating Brian Murray stars in Patrick Hamilton's thriller about a man who drives his wife insane (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. 'MEMORY' Previews start tomorrow. Opens on Thursday. Part of the increasingly essential Brits Off Broadway festival, a new play by Jonathan Lichtenstein (''The Pull of Negative Gravity''), about the way people choose to remember events, reveals how the Holocaust still haunts the present. Terry Hands directs (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. '110 IN THE SHADE' In previews; opens on Wednesday.

Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. 'RADIO GOLF' In previews; opens on Tuesday. The last play in August Wilson's cycle is set in 1997 and centers on the vital question of what will be done with the fabled Aunt Esther's house. Tonya Pinkins (''Caroline, or Change'') stars (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CORAM BOY' Set in 18th-century England, this rollicking melodrama about imperiled orphans is big and broad but not particularly deep. With a cast of 40, an orchestra in the pit and bursts of choral music (Handel, mostly) decorating the proceedings, it is tastefully splashy and certainly impressive, but less emotionally engaging than you might hope (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'AMERICAN FIESTA' The economist, consultant, preacher and playwright Steven Tomlinson makes his New York stage debut with a one-man show about how it was that he came to collect Fiestaware, the colorful china of the Depression years, which he deploys as a metaphor for just about everything. An astute observer of consumer obsession, Mr. Tomlinson ultimately subordinates much of his clever writing to a tepid and trite political message: that American civic life is a fractured bowl that needs to be put back together right now. American Fiesta is also about gay marriage, eBay and neuroscience, which is to say that it is about much too much (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Ginia Bellafante) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) 'BIOGRAPHY' A revival of S. N. Behrman's hoary 1932 comedy about a society portraitist and the men who keep trying to reign her in feels slight as a needlepoint pillow. As the play's supposedly beguiling heroine, Marion Froude, Carolyn McCormick never beguiles (2:15). The Pearl Theater, 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES OF COMEDY' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'DENIAL' An engrossing and timely legal drama about a Holocaust denier being defended by a Jewish lawyer, this play examines the moral and ethical dilemma inherent in the First Amendment and asks how much sufferance can a free society give its crackpots and maintain its individual liberties (2:30). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302. (Wilborn Hampton) 'REALISM' and 'JUMP!' The stately Jean Cocteau Repertory (now known as the Exchange) gets a hipster makeover with two foul-mouthed and aggressive new provocations from Britain (1:30 each). Kirk Theater, 420 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley) Last Chance 'THE ACCOMPLICES' Bernard Weinraub, a former reporter for The New York Times, has chosen a worthy subject for his first play: In 1940, the young Zionist Peter Bergson was determined to persuade the United States government to open its arms to Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis. Unfortunately, this production takes a hagiographic approach to its protagonist, emphasizing his heroism at the expense of more complex characterization. (2:00). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (David Ng) 'ANNE OF GREEN GABLES' The trick to refashioning beloved children's books for the stage is to keep both the spirit and the story largely intact. In this, Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford -- a musical-theater partnership of five decades' standing, who have moved from their hit ''I'm Getting My Act Together'' to the American Girl demographic -- have largely succeeded. This breezy, upbeat musical avoids slickness and gets the job done, and is nicely cast into the bargain (1:30). The Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Anne Midgette) * 'APOSTASY' Gino Dilorio's fearless play about a dying white Jewish woman who falls under the spell of a black televangelist is pretty good; the acting that delivers it is terrific, especially Susan Greenhill as the woman, and Susan Louise O'Connor as her daughter (2:00). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'JANE EYRE' Staged as a psychological drama, this new version of an oft-adapted classic is a shadowy, fluid, engaging production (2:45). Baruch Performing Arts Center's Nagelberg Theater, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE VIEW FROM K STREET STEAK' An attempt at political satire that misses with just about every shot, this play ends up being simply confusing and boring, neither funny nor timely (1:50). Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE COLON MOVIE FILM FOR THEATERS' (R, 87 minutes) Not as funny as the title or the Cartoon Network series on which it's based. (A. O. Scott) 'BLADES OF GLORY' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) 'THE CONDEMNED' (R, 100 minutes) This simple-minded vehicle for the wrestling star Steve Austin follows a bunch of muscle-bound lowlifes as they fight to the death for the benefit of an Internet reality show. Leaden and inept, the movie fails to deliver even the action goods, presenting every fight scene in such quaking, extreme close-up that it's difficult to tell who's pummeling whom. Fortunately, the language of pain is universal. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DIGGERS' (R, 90 minutes) This minutely observed period piece, set in 1976, about clam diggers on the south shore of Long Island has the brave, mournful tone of a Springsteen song (''My Hometown,'' say) set in Billy Joel territory. (Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Manohla Dargis) 'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'IN THE LAND OF WOMEN' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This meek, mopey comedy is the film equivalent of a sensitive emo band with one foot in alternative rock and the other in the squishy pop mainstream. The movie would like to think of itself as a softer, fuzzier ''Garden State.'' (Holden) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) 'KICKIN' IT OLD SKOOL' (PG-13, 107 minutes) Jamie Kennedy tries to lead a break-dancing revival, playing a man who was left in a coma by a break-dancing accident in 1986 and has only just now come out of it. Funny early, but grows less so, and the dancing sequences aren't as exciting as they ought to be. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece, independent to the bone. (Dargis) 'LONELY HEARTS' (No rating, 100 minutes) This beautifully photographed remake of Leonard Kastle's 1970 cult B movie ''The Honeymoon Killers'' succeeds better than many modern crime dramas in balancing the philosophical with the visceral, although its villains' dirty deeds still trump its deeper strain of melancholy. (Holden) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' (No rating, 120 minutes, in French) A film from the venerable French auteur Alain Resnais about love and cinematic spaces, elegant camera moves and six heavenly bodies as seen through a mighty telescope. (Dargis) * 'RED ROAD' (No rating, 113 minutes) Andrea Arnold's first feature falls into melodrama and implausibility at the end, but along the way it is a remarkably assured and complex piece of work, anchored by the director's formal control and by Jackie Dick's quietly heartbreaking performance as a Glasgow video-surveillance officer with an unhappy past. (Scott) 'SING NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE' (No rating, 94 minutes) A would-be ''Big Chill'' for 30-somethings, ''Sing Now'' concerns the 15-year reunion of a college a cappella group for a classmate's wedding in the Hamptons, and its attendant midlife crises. But the ensemble cast is too unwieldy, and interesting characters are given short shrift. Only Molly Shannon, in a selfless, robust performance, registers amid the suds. (Andy Webster) 'SNOW CAKE' (No rating, 112 minutes) Sigourney Weaver peels off layers of urbane sophistication to play a high-functioning autistic woman living in a rural Ontario town who intersects with an embittered Briton (Alan Rickman). Their technically accomplished performances partly camouflage the suds. (Holden) 'SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT' (No rating, 64 minutes) Betsy Blankenbaker's plodding but heartfelt documentary celebrates the career of Indiana's Crispus Attucks Tigers, who, in 1955, became the first all-black high school basketball team to win a state championship. Interspersing grainy game film and interviews with original team members, like the N.B.A. legend Oscar Robertson and the former Harlem Globetrotter Hallie Bryant, the movie pays tribute to a time when basketball scholarships and N.B.A. opportunities were unknown. Back then, a player's only opportunity was to make history. (Catsoulis) * 'SYNDROMES AND A CENTURY' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Thai) Apichatpong Weerasethakul, a Thai director who has become a star of the international festival circuit, makes films that are difficult, abstract and mysterious in the best art-cinema tradition, but at the same time characterized by unusual warmth and generosity of spirit. ''Syndromes,'' suggested by the lives of the filmmaker's parents and the music of Mozart, is a two-part invention on the themes of chance and longing, shot with an intoxicating mix of suavity and sensuality. (Scott) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This Bollywood movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame'' meets ''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Rachel Saltz) * 'TRIAD ELECTION' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Cantonese) The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller ''Triad Election'' as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier, more liable to stain. A brutal look at the shadows darkening the Hong Kong triads, the film picks up the narrative line first coiled and kinked in Mr. To's companion thriller, ''Election.'' (Dargis) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals AN EVENING WITH ANDREAS HYKADE AND MARIUSZ WILCZYNSKI (Monday) This evening includes works by two leading contemporary animators, Andreas Hykade from Germany and Mariusz Wilczynski from Poland. ''The Runt,'' the concluding episode of Mr. Hykade's trilogy of ''country films,'' will have its United States premiere; Mr. Wilczynski's latest work, ''Kizi Mizi'' -- which the director describes as ''a tough love story between a cat and a mouse'' -- will have its world premiere. Both animators will be on hand to discuss the works. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) RADICAL SCAVENGER: THE FILMS OF EMILE DE ANTONIO (Today through Thursday) The director Emile de Antonio reinvented the art of the collage film in the documentaries he made from 1963 to 1989, the year of his death. He raided network news footage and archival sources to select sounds and images that he would then recombine into radical political statements. This series at the Anthology Film Archives begins tonight with a new print of Mr. de Antonio's most celebrated and influential film, ''In the Year of the Pig'' (1968). A pointed assemblage of television reports about the Vietnam War, both abroad and at home, ''In the Year of the Pig'' was among the most widely seen protest films in the United States. Among the other titles: ''Rush to Judgment'' (1966), di Antonio's critical analysis of the Warren Report (made with the conspiracy theorist Mark Lane); ''America Is Hard to See'' (1970), about the presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy; and ''Millhouse: A White Comedy'' (1971), a comic portrait of Richard M. Nixon. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr) WILD AT HEART: BARRY GIFFORD (Tuesday) The novelist and screenwriter Barry Gifford will attend a screening of ''Wild at Heart,'' David Lynch's 1990 film adapted from Mr. Gifford's novel about a pair of extremely star-crossed young lovers (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern). This will be the rarely screened European version, which includes, if memory serves, a little extra gore than Americans were allowed to see in the R-rated film released in theaters here. BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AIR (Thursday) This French duo, whose every electronic note seems to drip with breathy, limply funky pop nostalgia, plays as part of David Bowie's High Line Festival. At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com or highlinefestival.com; $36 and $46. (Ben Sisario) * KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) The songs in ''Simply Styne,'' Ms. Akers's beautiful tribute to the composer Jule Styne, have been arranged into a touching, tongue-in-cheek cabaret answer to ''Scenes From a Marriage.'' The pianist Don Rebic is her witty partner in deconstruction. (Through May 12.) At 9, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $65 dinner charge at 9; $25 minimum at 11:30. (Stephen Holden) ANTIBALAS (Tomorrow) This Brooklyn collective worships the musky Afro-funk of Fela Kuti, and can produce a credible facsimile of it, thickly textured with reverb-heavy guitars and brawny horns. Its latest, ''Security'' (Anti-), also follows Fela's other big legacy: no-holds-barred denunciations of political oppression and corruption. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Sisario) * ARCADE FIRE, THE NATIONAL (Monday through Wednesday) Arcade Fire became king of the indie-rock mountain with a lovable, artsy eccentricity and a disarming emotional clarity. Its new album, ''Neon Bible'' (Merge), is dark and preoccupied but satisfyingly cathartic. The National, from Brooklyn, plays flawless, wilting ballads threaded with subtly brilliant guitar playing by Bryce Dessner and the dry, cynical baritone of Matt Berninger. Monday and Tuesday at 7 p.m., United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171, bowerypresents.com; Wednesday at 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com or highlinefestival.com; sold out. (Sisario) THE BAMBOOZLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Web site for this lollapalooza in the Giants Stadium parking lot has a faux radio station, complete with obnoxious promo spots crackling with pyrotechnic sound effects. It's unfortunately appropriate for the Bamboozle, a roll call of more than 100 young hard-rock bands that, once you get past the headliners, sound utterly interchangeable and predictable -- the kind that make you want to change the station. My Chemical Romance and Muse headline tomorrow, and Linkin Park on Sunday. A few highlights are Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Killswitch Engage, Weird Al Yankovic, Captured by Robots, Lordi, Andrew W. K., and Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock (''It Takes Two''). At noon, Meadowlands Sports Complex, Routes 3 and 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, thebamboozle.com; $35 each day. (Sisario) * BEIRUT, FINAL FANTASY (Sunday through Tuesday) A year ago Zach Condon, a 19-year-old from Albuquerque who records as Beirut, released ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing), an album of somber, sepia-toned marches with touches of Balkan brass. He quickly became a celebrity among music bloggers, which means that by now Beirut has become a kind of blog classic rock. As Final Fantasy, Owen Pallett creates nervous universes in miniature, looping ribbons of violin around his quavering voice. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * BJORK (Tomorrow and Tuesday) It's been a long time since Bjork's combination of wailing indie-rock, eroticized electronica and use of random musical props -- Inuit choirs, beatboxers, African kora players -- has been truly avant-garde, or even surprising. But her latest album, ''Volta'' (Elektra), still sounds fresh and energized, with every sound becoming her exotic plaything. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., with Konono No. 1, a Congolese band whose polyrhythmic bubblings are made with amplified thumb pianos, at the United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171; Tuesday at 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 307-7171, apollotheater.com; both sold out. Konono No. 1 also plays tomorrow night at the Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $23. The doors open at 8, and Magik Markers opens. (Sisario) * BLONDE REDHEAD (Tuesday) Its days of spindly, atonal guitar webs apparently behind it, Blonde Redhead has for the last few years been making lusher, more cottony music, as if finally realizing that its amplifiers have reverb buttons. Its latest, ''23'' (4AD), is a gorgeous trip through clouds of overdriven guitar and heavenly vocals, recalling those kings of overdriven guitar and heavenly vocals, My Bloody Valentine. With Fields. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) BOWLING FOR SOUP (Wednesday) When the venerable British singer and guitarist Richard Thompson put together his album ''1,000 Years of Popular Music,'' his choices included ''Sumer Is Icumen In,'' Renaissance ballads and Cole Porter's ''Night and Day,'' as well as ''1985,'' a gag catalog of '80s nostalgia by this otherwise undistinguished Texas rock band. (''When did Motley Crue become classic rock?/And when did Ozzy become an actor?'') It's a fun karaoke number, though Mr. Thompson may have been making another point: if you were really going to preserve the most representative songs of our culture, you'd have to include some ''1985s,'' right? At 8 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $17.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) BRIGHTBLACK MORNING LIGHT (Tomorrow and Sunday) Though nominally part of the current psych-folk revival, Brightblack Morning Light has a sound that is harder to place, and therefore more intriguing: an electric hum; warbling keyboards that evoke damp funk; and ecstatic, breathy chants, like the rituals of a secret forest cult. The songs on its most recent album were written, the band has said, while living in tents in Northern California. Also on the bill: Daniel A.I.U. Belteshazzar-Higgs with Chiara Giovando. Tomorrow at 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; Sunday at 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $13 in advance; $15 at the door. (Sisario) JIM CAMPILONGO, MIKE VIOLA (Monday) Just another night at the Living Room, a plain Lower East Side cabaret that puts on one guitar-cradling singer-songwriter after another, some of them world-class. Mr. Campilongo is a well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band, the Little Willies; his Electric Trio has had a Monday-night residency forever. Mr. Viola, jumping from piano to guitar, sings strident power-pop with some jagged wit. Also on the bill are Kelly Jones and Phillip La Rue. At 8 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; no cover. (Sisario) CORNELIUS (Thursday) Keigo Oyamada, a Japanese musician who records as Cornelius (he took his name after Roddy McDowall's character in ''Planet of the Apes''), is a witty if cold conceptualist, toying with minimal electronics and off-kilter rhythms that sound like the stimuli of some psychological lab experiment. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $25. (Sisario) BEN GIBBARD (Tuesday) The singer of Death Cab for Cutie, the indie-rock giants whose spectrum of mood runs from lovelorn and aloof to wistful and aloof, is on a rare solo tour. With David Bazan and Johnathan Rice. At 7:30 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org or bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) KIKI AND HERB (Sunday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And some late-night gigs at Joe's Pub. And the inimitable Christmas show. (Highlight: a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'') Kiki and Herb can't stay away from the stage, and New York is the better for it. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) * TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS (Tomorrow) As stalwart as you can be in indie rock, Mr. Leo has made a long and admirable career matching the musical fury of Clash-like punk with impassioned, highly personal social commentary. His new album, ''Life Among the Living'' (Touch and Go), is a reminder that he is one of the best and most uncompromising songwriters in the game. With Love of Diagrams. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $19. (Sisario) MAGIC NUMBERS (Wednesday) Perfectly jangly bubblegum harmonies of mid-'60s vintage get a slight melancholy twist with this British foursome, made up of brother-and-sister pairs. With All Smiles. At 7 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $25. (Sisario) * MARTIRIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) This Spanish singer, long a curious mingler of pop, jazz and flamenco, recorded her new album, ''Primavera en Nueva York'' (Calle 54), in New York with a jazz band, its boleros reinterpreted as a languorous, savory jazz suite. She makes her New York debut at Joe's Pub. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Sisario) MOE (Tonight through Sunday) One chord is all Moe needs to start one of its nimble, quick-fingered jams. Its music starts with the Grateful Dead-Allman Brothers hybrids that most jam bands use, and from there it takes off toward Southern rock, spacey interludes or the borderline of funk. At 9, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; sold out. (Jon Pareles) NEKROMANTIX (Sunday) Is it Halloween already? This Copenhagen trio follows the ''Munsters''-as-punk lead of the Misfits and the Cramps with a full sideshow of warped rockabilly, B movie titles (new album: ''Life Is a Grave & I Dig It!'') and, most important, ghoulish stacked hairdos. With Heart Attacks, Westbound Train and Orange. At 8 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $12.50. (Sisario) JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Wednesday) Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn and depressed, sung over light strums of guitar and with the guileless vulnerability of a 2 a.m. phone confession, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' She has a Wednesday residency this month at the Living Room. At 11 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) * JOHN PIZZARELLI AND JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) These married musicians have been called the ''Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim, Dave Frishberg, Paul Simon, and Lambert, Hendricks & Ross join hands. (Through May 26.) At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 Tuesday through Thursday; $85 tonight and tomorrow. (Holden) DULCE PONTES (Thursday) This Portuguese singer's champions (or at least her publicists) call her the successor to the fado queen Amália Rodrigues. Not quite: Ms. Pontes's style has leaned pretty far toward the soapy and homogenized glitz you can hear every year at the Eurovision festival. (Ms. Pontes was a competitor in 1991.)

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow) Bartlett Sher's breezy production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' which was introduced in November, conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which the characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality in this tale of romantic intrigue also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast, notably the captivating young mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. Some major changes are coming to the cast, though, for the final performances. The accomplished American tenor Lawrence Brownlee, in his Met debut role, makes a sweet-toned, technically agile and appealing Count Almaviva. The baritone Russell Braun is a hardy and clever Figaro. Maurizio Benini conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 tickets available. (Anthony Tommasini) LA GRAN SCENA OPERA COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the tradition of every great diva who just can't say goodbye to the stage, Mme. Vera Galupe- Borszkh is following last year's 20th annual and absolute last farewell with a return engagement, ''Back by Personal Whim (and Popular Demand).'' Mme. Vera, for the two or three opera lovers in New York still unfamiliar with her name, is a creation of the brilliant Ira Siff, who skewers opera and its mores as only one steeped in it can. Madame's recitals are a combination of stand-up comedy and ''Vissi d'arte,'' and have been shown to be suitable even for nonopera fans -- if they can get tickets. At 8, Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, granscena.org; $33. (Anne Midgette) * 'IL TRITTICO' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) The Met's new ''Trittico,'' Puccini's triptych of one-act operas, is now the most elaborate production in the company's repertory. The director Jack O'Brien has created grandly old-fashioned yet insightful and effective stagings of these three very different operas: ''Il Tabarro,'' a grim love triangle aboard a barge in Paris; ''Suor Angelica,'' a tender, mystical and ultimately devastating story of a young nun's yearning to be with her dead child; and ''Gianni Schicchi,'' an irreverent comedy about the avaricious relatives of a miserly old man who has just died. The earthy soprano Maria Guleghina as the beleaguered barge-owner's wife, the impassioned soprano Barbara Frittoli as Sister Angelica and the stylish baritone Alessandro Corbelli as the shrewd Schicchi are standouts, though the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe almost steals each show playing three supporting roles. James Levine conducts vibrant and beautifully refined performances. Tonight at 8, Monday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $205 tickets available tonight; $175 for Monday and Thursday. (Tommasini) 'TURANDOT' (Tuesday) Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant take on a Puccini fantasy of Far Eastern bloodthirstiness and lust helps wind down the Met's season. Erika Sunnegardh continues in the title role. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175 tickets remaining. (Bernard Holland) Classical Music * PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Thursday) During his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall this season, this astounding French pianist has revealed himself to be a fascinating concert programmer and astute music historian. The next-to-last of his Perspectives concerts, called ''Programming Games,'' offers an eclectic evening of 20th-century works for piano and percussion by Ligeti, Peter Eotvos and Gyorgy Kurtag, culminating in Bartok's exciting Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion. You can be sure that Mr. Aimard will have an intriguing explanation for having included Steve Reich's ''Clapping Music'' in the mix. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Tommasini) AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Composers, especially young ones, have too few chances to hear their new orchestral works performed. Part concert, part service, part competition, this orchestra's annual new-music readings address the gap, selecting nine composers (from 150 submissions this year) to receive feedback from mentor composers and conductors. One of the nine will win a $15,000 prize and an official premiere at an American Composers Orchestra concert; all will hear their music performed by a professional orchestra -- a prize in itself.

(Vivien Schweitzer) MATTHIAS GOERNE AND CHRISTOPH ESCHENBACH (Monday) Call it the Fischer-Dieskau effect: Germany has produced a whole crop of fine baritones, and one of the finest is Matthias Goerne, with a dark, full voice; a slightly distracting penchant for onstage gesticulation; and a constant search for artistic stimulation that will push him to extend his artistic horizons. Christoph Eschenbach, moving off the podium and taking his place as accompanist, joins him for a concert of Schumann (including the Op. 24 ''Liederkreis'') and Brahms (including ''Vier Ernste Gesänge,'' a wrenching set to which Mr. Goerne should do full justice). At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. (Midgette) INTERPRETATIONS (Thursday) To celebrate the composer Chinary Ung's 65th birthday, several ensembles and soloists -- Antares, the Brentano String Quartet, the cellist Maya Beiser, the percussionist Steven Schick and the baritone Thomas Buckner -- are joining forces to play some of his music.

In their new multimedia ''EXIT,'' they create a funeral rite for themselves in which they watch from the afterlife while colleagues offer eulogies and flashbacks. At 8:30, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $10. (Dunning) NORA CHIPAUMIRE (Tonight) This is the second and last performance of ''push/pull theories'' by Ms. Chipaumire, a Zimbabwean dancer, and the choreographer and writer/director Linnet Taylor. Ms Chipaumire is a powerful performer whose work explores her experience as an immigrant and her relationship to her history and country.

(Sulcas) ALONZO KING'S LINES BALLET (Tonight through Sunday) This San Francisco company dances ballet with an unusually streamlined and extra-active body line and attack. Mr. King's new ''Moroccan Project'' is set to African drumming and oud and violin music. His ''Migration,'' also new, will be danced to music by Pharoah Sanders, Miguel Frasconi and Leslie Stuck.

(Dunning) MONEY OF THE MONTH CLUB (Tonight and tomorrow night) We're not quite sure what this is all about, but it sounds as if it lives up to the Dixon Place standard of the cozily bizarre. At 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, dixonplace.org; $12; $10 students and 65+. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The new production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' by the company director, Peter Martins, continues. The doomed young lovers will be danced by Sterling Hyltin and Robert Fairchild (tonight, tomorrow night and Tuesday); Tiler Peck and Sean Suozzi (tomorrow afternoon and Thursday); Erica Pereira and Allen Peiffer (Sunday); and Kathryn Morgan and Seth Orza (Wednesday). (Through May 13.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $86. (Dunning) DAVID PARKER AND THE BANG GROUP (Tuesday through Thursday) The members of Mr. Parker's troupe use their bodies as instruments -- literally -- creating a percussive score as they dance. His new ''Hour Upon the Stage'' is likely to offer the eccentric comedy that Mr. Parker specializes in, or as press materials put it, a ''ribald approach to gender and sexuality.'' On Tuesday there will be a preshow talk at 6.30 p.m. (Through May 12.) At 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $25; $15 for students, 65+ and artists. (Sulcas) RAGAMALA MUSIC AND DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) From Minneapolis, the company mixes Indian Bharatanatyam dance with contemporary movement, Japanese taiko drums and a capella singing. (Through May 13.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., Thursday at 7 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, newvictory.org; $12.50 to $35. (Dunning) SKOVE WORKS (Thursday) Lily Skove and her modern-dance company will present ''SPLIT,'' a collaboration with the lighting designer T J Hellmuth that plays with hidden and obstructed perspectives in shadowy spaces that might be rooms in a house. And this mustily idiosyncratic performing space would seem the ideal setting. (Through May 12.) At 8 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Dunning) * URBAN BUSH WOMEN (Tuesday through Thursday) Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's ''Walking With Pearl: Africa Diaries'' and ''Walking With Pearl: Southern Diaries,'' works based on the travel diaries of the modern-dance pioneer Pear Primus, are the linchpins of the two programs at the Joyce offered by this dynamic company. There are other draws, however: a new work by Camille A. Brown, one of the most promising young choreographers around, and a restaging of Blondell Cummings's ''Chicken Soup.'' (Through May 13.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $36. (Sulcas) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: MARTíN RAMíREZ, through May 13. Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color, and an unforgettable cast of characters. But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. In addition to being one of the season's best exhibitions and the first of his work in a New York museum, this show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin. Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand's strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GREY ART GALLERY: 'BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O'DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND,' through July 14. Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O'Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It's a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today's most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart/. (Bridget L. Goodbody) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 88th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'AWAKENINGS: ZEN FIGURE PAINTING IN MEDIEVAL JAPAN,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Holland Cotter) THE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter) * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * THE MET: 'VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,' through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through June 17. Even in the contemporary art world the symbolism of the Book of Revelation has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) * THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * NEUE GALERIE: 'VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL,' through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world's latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Goodbody) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TARYN SIMON,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown * RICHARD OELZE: PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS FROM THE 1950s & 1960s Nearly two dozen paintings in the first United States show of this little-known German Surrealist introduce an introvert with a penchant for grisaille grottolike structures that seem built on air, and for soft, fleshy forms that sometimes have eyes or reveal hidden faces or figures. Max Ernst is a big influence, and Pavel Tchelitchew an obvious analogy, but the exquisite rendering and pervasive unquiet are Oelze's alone. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through May 12. (Smith) Galleries: 57th Street * KATHY BUTTERLY: BETWEEN A ROCK AND A SOFT PLACE Although she is a little off her game here, this extraordinarily talented ceramic sculptor continues to impress with exquisitely detailed, radiantly colored, art historically aware, discreetly lascivious little pieces, especially if you have never seen her work before. Still, the question of whether it isn't time for a change hangs over the proceedings. Tibor deNagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through May 19. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo * 'GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this survey gives a sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, Soho, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * 'PRIME TIME: MICKALENE THOMAS AND SHINIQUE SMITH' A sparkling double-header by two very different artists with much in common. In paintings encrusted with rhinestones, Ms. Thomas gives 1970s pin-up portraits of African-American women the shimmer of Byzantine mosaics. Ms. Smith turns bundles of cast-off clothes into floral bouquets of exotic patterning. Caren Golden Fine Art, 539 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-8304, carengoldenfineart.com, through May 12. (Cotter) Galleries: Other * SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, through Sept. 10. (Smith) * LILY LUDLOW Best known as a designer for Imitation of Christ and Somnus, Ms. Ludlow offers a handful of draftsmanly paintings for this solo show. Done on faint dark lines on a white ground, each group picture presents nude, semi-classical figures entangled in what appear to be ethereal, sadistic ballets. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, Chinatown, (212) 925-4631, canadanewyork. com, through May 13. (Cotter) Last Chance DELPHINE COURTILLOT From O. Winston Link to Anna Gaskell and ''The Blair Witch Project,'' there are far too many borrowed bits in these large watercolors based on staged photographs of people in dark, desolate landscapes. But the larger question is why the images wouldn't do just as well in their original photographic form. Tilton Gallery, 8 East 76th Street, (212) 731-2221, jacktiltongallery.com; closes tomorrow.(Smith) * WALTER DE MARIA Counting and space -- important to both Minimal and Conceptual Art -- come together with unusual clarity, if a bit too much in the way of gleaming metal, in two large installations by the creator of ''The Lightning Field'' earthwork. Both pieces consist of several dozen shiny, meter-long stainless-steel rods presented in spaces that couldn't be much more pristine. Experience the spatial levitation and note the number of sides on the rods; in both cases, they increase row by row. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1717, and 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JONATHAN LASKER One of the tortoises of '80s painting, this artist has cultivated his narrow abstract vocabulary without painting himself into a corner, and this latest show is one of his best. The usual asides to the history of abstract painting continue, as does the almost garish postmodern style, but there is more coherence in both single works and the group. Perhaps this is because Mr. Lasker's hand and brush have always stayed in the picture, subverting yet partaking of traditional touch and surface. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212) 242-7737; closes tomorrow. (Smith) ORLY GENGER: MASSSPEAK More than three tons of nylon climbing rope knotted into mats and arranged in mounds that sometimes touch the ceiling add to the tradition of filling gallery space with unusual quantities of just one thing for an effect that is at once dour and hilarious, like a playground designed by a Welsh miner. Larissa Goldston, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7887, larissagoldston.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JONATHAN MONK: 'SOME KIND OF GAME BETWEEN THIS AND THAT' As usual, this Conceptually inclined Scottish artist concentrates on sly tributes to, or plays on, works by other artists, among them Bruce Nauman, Chris Burden, John Baldessari and René Magritte. The slightest pieces are best, including drawings done on old books and ''The Cheat,'' in which ''this'' and ''that'' consist of an early silent film accompanied by a boom box tuned to a classical music station. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith * MAY STEVENS: 'ASHES ROCK SNOW WATER' The outstanding piece in this beautiful show of recent work is a mural-size painting of eddying water, the surface flecked with glinting bits of mica and amber, as if spirits were moving beneath the turbulence. Mary Ryan Gallery, 527 West 56th Street, (212) 397-0669; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * TEMPORARY SERVICES: 'GROUP WORK' Temporary Services, an inventive Chicago-based artists' collective, was given the run of Printed Matter's archives and came up with a fascinating selection of collectively published materials covering several decades. In addition, the group has installed a photographic installation that touches on the many things that ''group'' may mean, from Apostles, to Immigrants, to Upper Class. Printed Matter Inc., 195 10th Avenue, at 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 925-0325; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LORNA SIMPSON' This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)",

Was born on November 23, 1972, in Brooklyn, New York, to Cheryl D. Fells Davis and Morris H. Green. His untimely passing on February 10, 2007, at the age 34, occurred in his beloved community of Greenwich Village in New York City. Corey attended Fessenden School in Massachusetts, and Loomis Chaffee in Connecticut, where he balanced academics and athletics. Corey played tennis, basketball, and was the captain of the soccer and lacrosse teams at Loomis Chaffee. His exceptional skill in soccer led to an invitation to try out for the U.S. soccer team. In 1995, Corey earned a Bachelor of Science Degree at the University of Vermont in Burlington. While at the University of Vermont, he performed with a professional band where he played trap drums. Throughout his life music was important. At the time of his death, Corey was employed by Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc., as a Senior Vice President of Institutional Investments in New York City. The impact of his life goes beyond his accomplishments as a Senior Vice President for institutional investments, musician, and athlete. Perhaps Corey's greatest gift is that he inspired and connected others. Some people create deals, but Corey created relationships by connecting his diverse friends to each other. With a kind word for everyone and the ability to make everyone laugh, the flame that Corey lit will continue to burn. His dedication and commitment to family and friends, generosity, intelligence, integrity, passion, and professional advancement showed a true leader. He is survived by his parents. He is also survived by his stepfather, Johnny Davis; maternal grandmother, Minnie Fells; paternal grandmothers, Elizabeth Green and Charlotte Green; sisters, Amanda and Madison Green; brother, Gannon Green; aunts, Gayle Green Taylor and Gina Green; cousins, Ernest Rollins, Mary ''Lolli'' Houston, and Izell Fells; countless grandaunts and cousins; his godmother, Wilmer Hill Grier; and the love of his life, soul mate, and companion, Salome Makonnen.

Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 362-7600. 'THE GAZILLION BUBBLE SHOW' Fan Yan holds the world's record for the largest bubble ever blown, and in an even more amazing feat, he's parlayed this oddball stunt into a bubble-themed, family-friendly show (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. 'HOWARD KATZ' In previews; opens on March 2.

Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'KING LEAR' Previews start today. Opens on March 7. He played Hamlet. He played Falstaff. It was only a matter of time before Kevin Kline took on this proud, misguided patriarch. James Lapine directs. The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 260-2400. 'THE MADRAS HOUSE' In previews; opens on Thursday. Yet another modern-sounding play by Harley Granville Barker (''Waste'') comes out of the woodwork: a 1909 drama about business battles, family values and sex (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. 'MARY ROSE' In previews; opens on Feb. 20. Although it can sometimes seem otherwise, J. M.

Michael Greif (''Rent'') directs MCC Theater's new play about a married woman who has an affair with a doctor (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. Broadway 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in rural Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THAT I WILL EVER BE' In this false-feeling comedy-drama by Alan Ball, creator of ''Six Feet Under,'' a gay hustler undergoes an identity crisis when he finds himself falling for one of his clients. Slick but mostly stale in its analysis of a society afraid of emotional engagement (2:15). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'ANON.' Kate Robin's savvy, dark romantic comedy about sexual addiction doesn't live up to its potential (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DUTCHMAN' A revival of the poet Amiri Baraka's screed on race and American values, 43 years after its Greenwich Village debut, aims for all the fire and might of a Malcolm X speech but none of the rhetorical elegance. It shouts so loudly that you can't hear a thing (1:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE FEVER' Wallace Shawn performs his provocative monologue about a guilt-riddled bourgeois everyman sweating his way through a moral crisis. The rich, often hypnotic writing draws us into his tortured mindscape, as he shifts between shame over his sense of entitlement and reasoned arguments that sacrifice is unnecessary and pointless. Meanwhile, in the third world, the violence and poverty continue unabated (1:30). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'FRANK'S HOME' Peter Weller plays Frank Lloyd Wright in Richard Nelson's dreary bio-drama, which lingers lovingly on its subject's feet of clay while paying arid lip service to his genius (1:45). Playwrights Horizons Mainstage, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 719-4200. (Isherwood) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates) 'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates) 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' and 'THE JEW OF MALTA' F. Murray Abraham plays two Elizabethan villains in repertory for the Theater for a New Audience. Mr. Abraham's sinister but still moving Shylock is the dark heart of Darko Tresnjak's chilly, powerful staging of one of Shakespeare's unfunniest comedies. As Barabas in David Herskovits's goofy, postmodern ''Jew of Malta,'' he's the lively center of a carnival that doesn't do justice to Christopher Marlowe's harsh satire on Christian hypocrisy and venality (each 2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'A SPANISH PLAY' The great Zoe Caldwell returns to the New York stage after an absence of a decade, in the fine company of Linda Emond, Denis O'Hare and Larry Pine. That's the good news. The bad? The play. Yasmina Reza's pseudo-philosophical and metatheatrical trifle is utterly forgettable (1:50). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) * 'TOYS IN THE ATTIC' Austin Pendleton's fine revival of Lillian Hellman's last play faithfully attacks the corrosive attachments of family. What good is a family, and thus a society, the play implicitly asks, that can only look in the mirror? (2:30) Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'VICTORIA MARTIN: MATH TEAM QUEEN' Must all stage teenagers speak in that exaggerated surfer-dude style in which ''awesome'' and ''totally'' make up about 50 percent of any conversation? Yes, apparently they must, from the evidence presented in this thin comedy, which is about a high school girl who finds herself on the all-male math team. The playwright, Kathryn Walat, seems to have been trying to grab the coattails of a certain spelling-bee-related show. She missed (2:00). The Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, , 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL' Five vignettes about finding love and keeping it as immature in attitude as they are thin in substance. The filmmaker Anthony Minghella, whose offering here is a short play called ''Hang Up,'' provides the silliest (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Bellafante) 'GONE' In this 90-minute meditation on grief and mourning, composed as a pastiche of texts from Proust, Sophocles, Allen Ginsberg and others, the playwright Charles Mee's habitual postmodern techniques prove utterly inadequate to his subject matter. The piece is fuzzy and diffuse and leaves an impression of evading the suffering it refers to (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE GREAT DIVORCE' The Magis Theater Company makes a creditable effort to explore spiritual matters in this adaptation of C. S. Lewis's story about a bus trip through the afterlife. In well-acted vignettes, characters are led to examine their lives and ruling loves. It's often intriguing, and rarely preachy (1:30). Salvation Army Theater, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'NO GREAT SOCIETY' The brainy experimentalists of Elevator Repair Service provide a madcap and almost dreamlike re-enactment of a 1968 episode of William F. Buckley's ''Firing Line,'' which features Mr. Buckley squaring off with Jack Kerouac (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'THE SCENE' Theresa Rebeck's latest is a sharp-witted, sharp-elbowed comedy about the savage economies of sex and show business in Manhattan. Tony Shalhoub plays an out-of-work actor, Charlie, happily married -- but not really -- to Patricia Heaton's frazzled chat show booker. Enter the femme fatale Clea, played by the gifted Anna Camp, and goodbye, Charlie (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ALPHA DOG' (R, 117 minutes) Based on a true Southern California crime, Nick Cassavetes's entertaining exploitation flick features a lot of attractive, talented young actors shimmying across the screen while embodying the collective parental nightmare. Do you know where your children are? Well, in this film they're getting busy, chilling out, smoking blunts and chugging coolers faster than a toothless wino. Oh, and committing murder. (Manohla Dargis) 'ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES' (PG, 94 minutes) Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy (Freddie Highmore) who shrinks to microscopic size to find some gems and his missing grandfather. Lots of famous names (Madonna, Robert De Niro, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg) lend their voices to the computerized part of the movie, but only briefly near the end does everything click. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott) 'BECAUSE I SAID SO' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore as mother and daughter. What did she say, exactly? Whatever it was, it wasn't as funny as it should have been. (Scott) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn misery into entertainment. (Dargis) 'BREAKING AND ENTERING' (R, 119 minutes) This high-toned, feel-bad exercise in liberal guilt comes from Anthony Minghella, who brings the same earnest humorlessness to present-day London that he has brought to the historical past. Jude Law is an architect; Juliette Bi noche is a Bosnian seamstress; and Vera Farmiga provides a glimmer of wit and liveliness as a Russian prostitute who shows up to drink coffee, show her underwear and discuss the themes of the movie. (Scott) 'BURNING ANNIE' (No rating, 95 minutes) This thoroughly postmodern romantic comedy concerns a college student (Gary Lundy) whose obsession with Woody Allen's movie ''Annie Hall'' stunts his ability to live in reality and have normal relationships. While thoroughly professional in its execution, it unfortunately has no life of its own, apart from its fascination with Mr. Allen's film. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'CATCH AND RELEASE' (PG-13, 124 minutes ) Jennifer Garner is a young woman in Boulder, Colo., coping with the sudden death of her fiancé, who she discovers had another, secret life. Although there are signs that the first-time director Susannah Grant (screenwriter of ''Erin Brockovich'') was reaching for something more layered than a formulaic ''chick flick,'' the story never achieves basic credibility. At least its affection for its characters doesn't seem cynical. (Stephen Holden) * 'THE CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis) 'CONSTELLATION' (PG-13, 96 minutes) The writer-director Jordan Walker-Pearlman's drama about a biracial extended family of Alabamans convening to bury a matriarch, Carmel (Gabrielle Union), explores the generational aftershocks of racist violence with frank honesty and manages to be a decent ensemble romantic comedy in the bargain. If only the film weren't so boringly conceived. The powerhouse cast -- which includes David Clennon, Billy Dee Williams and Lesley Anne Warren -- escapes unscathed. (Seitz) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) * 'EAST OF HAVANA' (No rating, 82 minutes, in Spanish) With Jauretsi Saizorbitoria and Emilia Menocal as co-directors, this compelling nonfiction feature shows young Cuban rappers exercising the artist's prerogative to tell the truth in a country that muzzles free speech. The filmmakers -- who are Cuban-American themselves -- zero in on a collective called El Cartel. Although the film is set in 2004 -- during the run-up to the International Festival of Rap Cubano and in the shadow of Hurricane Charley -- there's no phony urgency to the setup. The filmmakers are mainly interested in hearing the music and learning about the musicians' compelling personal stories. (Seitz) 'EPIC MOVIE' (PG-13, 86 minutes) A cheap, dumb parody of expensive, dumb movies. (Scott) 'FACTORY GIRL' (R, 91 minutes) It's not entirely inappropriate that this film, George Hickenlooper's biography of Edie Sedgwick, the most glamorous of Andy Warhol's so-called superstars, should suggest a magazine layout masquerading as a film. The world through which Sedgwick (Sienna Miller) blazed and burned out was one that lived and died by the camera. It existed to be seen and drooled over. But God help you if you actually lived in it. (Holden) 'IN THE PIT' (No rating, 84 minutes, in Spanish) In his absorbing documentary about work and the transformation of men into laborers, the Mexican filmmaker Juan Carlos Rulfo gets down and dirty, literally and existentially. (Dargis) 'THE ITALIAN' (PG-13, 99 minutes, in Russian) This dark fairy tale from Russia pulls you into a richly atmospheric, persuasively inhabited world teeming with young foundlings and pathos, and upended by one remarkable little boy. (Dargis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'MAFIOSO' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Italian) This 1962 film, revived by Rialto Pictures, is a rambunctious, astonishing blend of farce, thriller and social satire. The director, Alberto Lattuada, follows an up-and-coming Fiat manager (Alberto Sordi) on a visit from Milan to his native village in Sicily. His homecoming is full of surprises -- painful for him, altogether delightful for the audience. (Scott) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zoë Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) 'PUCCINI FOR BEGINNERS' (No rating, 81 minutes) Snappy repartee with the ring of real conversation among people who are never at a loss for a remark is something every self-respecting Manhattan sophisticate imagines can be channeled into a screenplay with the crackle of vintage Woody Allen. That elusive tone is sustained through enough of Maria Maggenti's film ''Puccini For Beginners'' to make this screwball comedy of sexual confusion with lesbian inclinations a rarity. (Holden) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) * 'REGULAR LOVERS' (No rating, 175 minutes, in French) Philippe Garrel's tender portrait of late-1960s French youth stars the filmmaker's son, Louis Garrel, as a 20-year-old Parisian struggling through the fires of revolutionary promise and its smoldering remains. Magnificent. (Dargis) 'SERAPHIM FALLS' (R, 111 minutes) Archetypes and symbols solemnly parade through ''Seraphim Falls,'' a handsome, old-fashioned western of few words and heavy meanings that unfolds with the sanctimonious grandeur of a Biblical allegory. In this drama of pursuit, revenge and forgiveness, set in 1868, Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson are soldiers who fought on opposite sides of the Civil War and are now engaged in a life-and-death chase that takes them from the Ruby Mountains of Nevada to a final showdown in the desert. (Holden) 'THE SITUATION' (No rating, 106 minutes, in English and Arabic) Connie Nielsen stars as a correspondent sniffing around wartime Iraq in a narcoleptic thriller directed by Philip Haas from a screenplay by the journalist Wendell Steavenson. (Dargis) 'SMOKIN' ACES' (R, 107 minutes) Absolute garbage. (Scott) 'STOMP THE YARD' (PG-13, 109 minutes) Brotherhood is powerful in this sometimes compelling, sometimes complacent movie about stepping and African-American fraternity life at an Atlanta institution called Truth University. D J (Columbus Short), a street-style dancer, needs to find his place in a university ruled by Gammas and Thetas and stepping. (Rachel Saltz) 'TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Thai) A western weepie from Thailand, filmed in garish color. In spite of the relentless genre pastiche, it has a charming sincerity. (Scott) 'AN UNREASONABLE MAN' (No rating, 122 minutes) A very reasonable documentary about the long career of Ralph Nader as a consumer advocate and, more recently and vexingly to some of his former admirers, a perennial presidential candidate. (Scott) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) Film Series FRANK BEYER: IN MEMORIAM (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Mr. Beyer, who died in October at 74, was one of the few filmmakers in East Germany able to establish a personality of his own, while occasionally slipping subversive political messages into his work. This two-film program at MoMA includes the internationally successful Holocaust drama ''Jacob the Liar.'' Starring Vlastimil Brodsky as a Jewish man who broadcasts falsely optimistic news from his apartment in a Polish ghetto, ''Jacob'' will be introduced tonight by Professor Barton Byg, the director of the East German film collection at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. (The film will be repeated on Sunday). Tomorrow, Mr. Beyer's ''Naked Among Wolves'' (1963) is set at the Buchenwald concentration camp, where a group of inmates sacrifice everything to protect a small boy, unaware that the Allied liberation forces are approaching. ''Naked'' will be repeated on Thursday. (Through Feb. 22.) Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) CRITICS CHOICE: GREAT DOCUMENTARIES (Tomorrow and Sunday) This two-month program of recent documentaries chosen and introduced by members of the New York Film Critics Circle continues with Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer presenting Barbet Schroeder's 1974 film ''General Idi Amin Dada'' (tomorrow); Marshall Fine of Star introducing Barbara Kopple's 1991 ''American Dream,'' with Ms. Kopple present (tomorrow, followed by a screening of her own new film, directed with Cecila Peck, ''Shut Up and Sing''); Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly showing Adam Curtis's epic ''The Century of the Self'' (Sunday); and David Edelstein of New York magazine presenting ''Our Brand Is Crisis,'' Rachel Boynton's study of James Carville working on the 2002 Bolivian presidential campaign (Sunday; Ms. Boynton will attend a post-screening discussion.) (Through Feb. 25.) Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, www.movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) FILM COMMENT SELECTS (Wednesday and Thursday) A two-week series of overlooked recent films chosen by the editors of Film Comment, the publication of the Film Society of Lincoln Center. The series begins on Wednesday with Jean-Claude Brisseau's controversial ''Exterminating Angels,'' his loosely autobiographical account of how a French filmmaker was brought before the justice system for taping auditions of young actresses masturbating for his camera. On Thursday it's the local premiere of one of the most accomplished, elegant and exciting action films of the year, Johnnie To's Hong Kong gangster film, ''Exiled,'' in which two gangs of Triad hoodlums cross swords over the lucrative Macau market. (Through Feb. 27.) Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. LILY ALLEN (Tomorrow) A 21-year-old British singer who became a MySpace favorite with deceptively sweet, ska-infused pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her best putting down exes and disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' is a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got to go 'cause my house is on fire. I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario) APPLES IN STEREO (Thursday) This Denver band made a splash in the mid-'90s with power-pop songs in loud primary colors, like the Beach Boys reborn as a New Wave act. After five years of silence, they have a new album, ''New Magnetic Wonder,'' released by the actor Elijah Wood's record label, Simian. It makes one thing clear: it wasn't really the Beach Boys or the Beatles that Apples in Stereo was emulating all those years; it was Electric Light Orchestra. With Casper and the Cookies, and Cause Commotion. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) * ARCADE FIRE (Tuesday through Thursday) Three years ago, with its jubilantly clamorous album ''Funeral,'' this guitars, violins and accordion collective from Montreal performed a kind of musical miracle: making navel-gazing indie-rock seem not only fresh and sincere but also deeply meaningful. Its brilliant second record, ''Neon Bible'' (Merge), to be released next month, is darker and more preoccupied but nearly as cathartic, and next week the band begins a five-night stand at the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village. At 7:30 p.m., 55 Washington Square South, (212) 260-4700, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) DAVID BROMBERG (Tuesday) Mr. Bromberg can play just about anything with strings -- guitar, dobro, mandolin, fiddle -- and his knowledge of American music spans blues, bluegrass, country and rock. He also has a gift for elaborate verbal riffs that turn his long-suffering blues into comedy. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Jon Pareles) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) This ageless queen of genteel piano bar jazz plays everything from Sondheim to Monk with grace and authority. She sings too. Her rendition of ''Old Friends,'' from ''Merrily We Roll Along,'' will bring tears to your eyes. At 2 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58, with brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) JUDY COLLINS (Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Collins, a folk songbird for seemingly longer than anybody else has been a folk songbird, begins a three-week cabaret engagement at the Café Carlyle. At 8:45 p.m., Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $100 cover at tables, $65 at the bar. (Sisario) * 'CONCIERTO DEL AMOR' (Tomorrow) Someday all Valentine's Day music will be Latin pop, which revels in both the passionate and the treacly. This annual concert at Madison Square Garden features two salsa giants: Victor Manuelle, a leading young sonero, or improvising singer, who is not above dipping into reggaetón to score a hit, and Gilberto Santa Rosa, an unswerving traditionalist for three decades. Also on the bill are the great Latin jazz pianist Eddie Palmieri; Don Omar, a reggaetón star; the merengue regulars Elvis Crespo and Millie Quezada; and the Mexican pop duo Sin Bandera. At 8 p.m., (212) 307-7171 or (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $59.50 to $129.50. (Sisario) MARSHALL CRENSHAW (Wednesday) Mr. Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970s styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. With Matt Roach. At 8 p.m., the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Pareles) * PACO DE LUCÍA (Tomorrow and Sunday) One of the world's greatest guitarists, Mr. de Lucía is both a traditionalist and an adventurer, dipping into jazz and salsa but always retaining a solid grounding in flamenco. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; sold out. Sunday at 7 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $22 to $78 . (Sisario) * DIAMANDA GALÁS (Wednesday) Though she is invariably dressed in black, with her face in witchy streaks of makeup, Ms. Galás needs only her voice to terrify and seduce. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory; for two ''Valentine's Day Massacre'' sets, she will tear apart love songs by Peggy Lee, Marlene Dietrich, Chet Baker and Édith Piaf. At 6:30 and 9:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $20. (Sisario) GIRL TALK, PARTS AND LABOR (Tonight) Girl Talk is a Pittsburgh musician named Gregg Gillis who, when not on his computer job at a medical instrument company, makes a zany and frequently hilarious kind of short-attention-span dance-pop by stitching together brief samples from hit songs. He shares a bill with Parts and Labor, a squally Brooklyn three-piece that manages the tricky task of being both anarchic and anthemic. At 9, Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $15. (Sisario) * GYUTO MONKS (Sunday) The Gyuto monks of Tibet studied Buddhism and meditated for five centuries in their college in Lhasa before the Chinese invasion of 1959. One-tenth of the 900 monks followed the Dalai Lama into exile, and they re-established their monastery in India. They chant as they meditate with a technique that produces multiple overtones over their deep bass notes: an otherworldly sound that seeks to heal the world, punctuated by the clang of cymbals and the roar of long trumpets. At 7 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 545-7536, the-townhall-nyc.org or worldmusicinstitute.org; $35 and $40. (Pareles) HINDER (Tuesday) This Oklahoma band has little to distinguish it from the dozen or two other well-coiffed, heavily commercialized groups being pushed on hard-rock radio -- some day try a taste test of Hinder, Nickelback, Three Days Grace and Fuel -- except for its hit ''Lips of an Angel.'' An unfairly addictive power ballad about falling back in love with your ex (''My girl's in the next room/Sometimes I wish she was you''), it helped make Hinder's ''Extreme Behavior'' (Universal) the 10th-best-selling album of 2006. With Finger Eleven and Black Stone Cherry. At 7:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) KIKI AND HERB (Sunday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And some late-night gigs at Joe's Pub. And the annual, inimitable Christmas show. (Highlight: a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'') Kiki and Herb can't stay away from the stage, and New York is the better for it. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) LIFETIME (Tomorrow) In most ways, this New Jersey band was standard-issue 1990s hardcore punk, with lots of slashing guitars and angry, accusatory lyrics. But in a genre that is virtually uniform in sound as well as attitude, Lifetime stood out for slightly more attention to melody and a slightly more uplifting tone, and it became an important influence on emo. The band reunited recently after almost a decade, and just released a new, self-titled album on Decaydance, the label run by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy. With World/Inferno Friendship Society and Crime in Stereo. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Tonight and tomorrow night) Now in its ninth season, this series has greatly expanded from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like. Tonight features the 36-year-old theater composer Jason Robert Brown (''Parade,'' ''Urban Cowboy''), and tomorrow Betty Buckley is joined by Kenny Werner and Quintessence for some music that is actually a little underrepresented in this series: classics of the American songbook. Tonight at 8:30, tomorrow night at 8:30 and 10:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; sold out tonight, $40 to $90 tomorrow (8:30 show sold out). (Sisario) RAUL MALO ( Wednesday and Thursday) The leader of the Mavericks, Mr. Malo has never let himself be bound by the strictures of country. His music looks back to the 1950s and '60s with a clear-eyed nostalgia, and he has the soaring tenor voice of a dedicated Roy Orbison fan. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30 (Wednesday sold out). (Pareles) MIDLAKE (Tonight) This Texas quintet specializes in a lilting acoustic folk-rock sprinkled with soft piano and winds. With the Czars and St. Vincent. At 8:30, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) MOONEY SUZUKI (Thursday) One of the sharpest and loudest garage-rock bands in town -- in sound as well as in dress -- Mooney Suzuki draws on the frantic energy of mid-'60s British mod groups like the Who, as well as on the bruising blues-rock of Led Zeppelin. With General & Majors and Johan. At 8:30 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) SHIYANI NGCOBO (Tonight) Making his American debut, this singer and guitarist is a master of maskanda, a Zulu folk style in South Africa that relies on virtuosic guitar picking and arrangements of fiddle and concertina that sound comfortingly country. At 8:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Sisario) STEVE RILEY AND THE MAMOU PLAYBOYS (Sunday) The accordionist Steve Riley leads one of the best bands from the Louisiana bayous. It reaches back to some of the oldest Cajun tunes and can play them in traditional style, but it's not afraid of swamp-rock or a touch of country, either, and this weekend comes to New York for a Mardi Gras show. At 7:30 p.m., with a free zydeco dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597 or (212) 597-5126, letszydeco.com; $22. (Pareles) SLAYER (Thursday) One of the architects of modern heavy metal, Slayer emerged in the early 1980s with a hellish, claustrophobic sound -- all foreboding skies and tormented vocals, delivered at whip-crack speeds -- and has stuck steadfastly to it. With Unearth. At 7:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; sold out. (Sisario) ROD STEWART (Wednesday) His four Great American Songbook albums may not represent the most distinguished readings of those songs -- ditto his Bob Seger and Creedence Clearwater Revival covers on the recent ''Still the Same Great Rock Classics of Our Time'' (J) -- but when Rod Stewart lets go of his smugness, that whisky tenor of his can be a powerful interpretive instrument. Doesn't happen often, though. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-7171 or (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $55 to $129.50. (Sisario) VETIVER, VASHTI BUNYAN (Tomorrow) Last weekend Ms. Bunyan, an obscure light in the 1960s British folk scene with an impossibly fragile voice, and Vetiver, a hushed neofolk band that is one of the inheritors of her tradition, played at Carnegie Hall as part of David Byrne's Perspectives series. Their small sound was somewhat dwarfed by the place, but this gig, at Southpaw in Brooklyn, is more their size. At 9 p.m., 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. ERNESTINE ANDERSON (Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Anderson, a soulful and underrated jazz singer, reunites with another estimable veteran, the reliably gallant tenor saxophonist and flutist Frank Wess.

At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) ELI DEGIBRI QUARTET (Sunday and Tuesday) An Israeli saxophonist with a taste for burnished sonorities, Eli Degibri explores his own music with help from the bassist Ben Street, the drummer Jeff Ballard and either the pianist Aaron Goldberg (on Sunday) or the guitarist Jonathan Kreisberg (on Tuesday). Sunday at midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10; $5 for students, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) JOHN ELLIS QUARTET (Tonight) John Ellis is a tenor and soprano saxophonist drawn to loose-limbed funk, but he also has an interest in spacious modern jazz. His quartet features a guitarist with similar inclinations, the versatile and thoughtful Mike Moreno. At midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10; $5 for students; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) VICTOR GOINES QUINTET (Tuesday through Thursday) While best known as a big-band player and educator, the multireedist Victor Goines knows how to put together a solid combo. Here he cedes a portion of the spotlight to a guest singer, Vanessa Rubin. (Through Feb. 18.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) AYELET ROSE GOTTLIEB (Tuesday) Ms. Gottlieb is a commanding vocalist whose recent album ''Mayim Rabim'' (Tzadik) featured scriptural texts in the original Hebrew. She appears here with stalwart accompanists, like Michael Winograd on clarinet and Loren Stillman on saxophone. At 8 and 9:30 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum.

At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35. (Chinen) VINCENT HERRING (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Herring, a voluble alto saxophonist, rolls out a locomotive brand of post-bop with colleagues like the pianist Gerard D'Angelo and the drummer Carl Allen. At 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) ARTHUR KELL QUARTET (Tomorrow) On his last album, ''Traveller'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), the bassist and composer Arthur Kell pursued a searching strain of modern jazz.

(Chinen) JEAN-MICHEL PILC (Tonight) Mr. Pilc's piano playing has a joyous bounce no matter how dark or furious the extemporization, as he is likely to demonstrate in a solo recital at Fazioli Salon, a series at the Klavierhaus piano workshop. At 8 p.m., Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Midtown, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $25.

Their rhythm section here consists of Mike Gamble on guitar and Ches Smith on drums. At 10, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) JANIS SIEGEL (Wednesday) On ''A Thousand Beautiful Things'' (Telarc), Ms. Siegel explores the same brand of popular eclecticism she enjoys in Manhattan Transfer, but in a way that's a few degrees less cloying. She has good company on Valentine's Day: Edsel Gomez on piano, Edmar Castaneda on harp, Ben Street on bass and Steve Hass on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum.

STRICKLAND QUINTET (Thursday) The drummer E. J. Strickland -- like his brother Marcus, who joins him here on tenor saxophone -- hails from a generation fluent in jazz conventions but not beholden to them. The alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, the pianist Luis Perdomo and the bassist Hans Glawischnig round out his quintet.

(Chinen) TIERNEY SUTTON (Tuesday) With her new album, ''On the Other Side'' (Telarc), Ms. Sutton applies her pristine vocal style to a bouquet of songs about happiness or unhappiness in love. Her emotional oscillation is purposeful, sometimes transparently so: the Harold Arlen tune ''Get Happy'' appears first as a puzzling dirge and then, more convincingly, as a fizzy delight. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen) YOSVANY TERRY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Terry, a dynamic saxophonist and percussionist, chases post-bop ideals without abandoning the pull of his native Cuba. For his ''Afro Cuban Roots,'' a new piece inspired by Yoruban cultural traditions, he features the accomplished batá drummer Orlando (Puntilla) Rios and the dancer Felix (Pupi) Insua, along with an ensemble that includes Osmany Paredes on piano and Yunior Terry, Mr. Terry's brother, on bass.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' (Tomorrow) Salvatore Licitra again plays iron-man tenor, singing both ends of this beloved double-header. Dolora Zajick and Krassimira Stoyanova are the noteworthy sopranos. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Bernard Holland) * 'EUGENE ONEGIN' (Tonight and Tuesday night) For her first Met performances in the Russian role of Tatiana, the impressionable heroine of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' the soprano Renée Fleming will be inspired, no doubt, and possibly a little daunted by her Russian colleagues in this revival of Robert Carsen's 1997 production. The baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky sings Onegin, a role he seems born to portray, and Valery Gergiev will conduct. The Mexican-born tenor Ramón Vargas sings Lenski. This looks to be a highlight of the season. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'JENUFA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The charismatic Finnish soprano Karita Mattila is riveting in the title role of Janacek's grim, insightful and, by the end, consoling Czech opera ''Jenufa,'' the Met's revival of its 2003 production. Ms. Mattila's gleaming voice, with its cool Nordic colorings, and vibrant sensuality are ideal for this character, a foolishly trusting young woman in a Moravian village who has become pregnant by her cousin, the town rake who owns the local mill. The ageless German soprano Anja Silja is at once terrifying and pitiable as Jenufa's stern stepmother, Kostelnicka. Jiri Belohlavek conducts a sensitive and sweeping account of Janacek's teeming score, presented in its 1908 version. (The mezzo-soprano Judith Forst sings Kostelnicka in tomorrow evening's performance.) At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini) 'I PURITANI' (Thursday) The reason the Met dusted off its stodgy, old 1976 production of Bellini's ''Puritani'' was to present the glamorous and brilliant soprano Anna Netrebko as Elvira. For the final performance on Thursday, the admirable soprano Elizabeth Futral takes over for Ms. Netrebko, not an enviable assignment. Still, Ms. Futral is an impressive vocalist and an exciting interpreter of the Bel Canto repertory. She made her 1999 Met debut in the title role of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' and recently created the role of Princess Yueyang in Tan Dun's ''First Emperor.'' At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Monday) For its revival of Verdi's ''Traviata,'' in Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production, the Met is rotating casts, with three sopranos sharing the role of Violetta this season. Mary Dunleavy, who made her company debut in 1993, takes over the role on Monday night, with the tenor José Luis Duval as Alfredo, and the baritone Charles Taylor as Germont. Carlo Rizzi conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini) Classical Music AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Leon Botstein's latest interesting program looks at conductors who compose, including George Szell, Paul Kletzki, Harold Farberman and Leonard Bernstein.

Tomorrow and Sunday the DaPonte String Quartet plays Beethoven's Quartet in F (Op. 135), Gershwin's ''Lullaby'' and Wolf's ''Italian Serenade.'' The program concludes with Dvorak's Quintet for Piano and Strings in A (Op. 81), for which the quartet will be joined by Michael Kimmelman, a pianist and chief art critic (and a former music critic) of The New York Times. On Valentine's Day -- champagne and chocolates included -- the pianist Steven Beck plays Liszt, Chopin and Beethoven, and on Thursday, the program includes piano trios by Brahms and Beethoven. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m.; and Wednesday at 7 p.m., Fulton Ferry landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35 tonight and Thursday, $40 tomorrow and Sunday, $50 on Wednesday. (Vivien Schweitzer) * BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) Not quite an oratorio, nearly an opera, Berlioz's ''Damnation de Faust'' skips back and forth between the opera house and the concert hall, and more and more frequently, it seems, in recent years. The nonstaged option allows the listener a novel-reader's freedom of imagination and perhaps a deeper immersion in the colors of the score, probably mined deeply in the reading of James Levine. Heading his cast is the veteran bass-baritone José van Dam as Mephistopheles. Yvonne Naef, Paul Groves and Andrew Gangestad are the other accomplished soloists, backed up by the Tanglewood Festival Chorus. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $39 to $127. (Anne Midgette) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) For what it is calling its Winter Festival, the Chamber Music Society is exploring English music, with an emphasis on works composed between 1900 and 1930. On Sunday the ensemble begins a bit earlier, with a Fantasia by Purcell, and then offers music by Vaughan Williams, Bliss and Warlock. The centerpiece on Tuesday is the Vaughan Williams song cycle ''On Wenlock Edge,'' to be sung by Russell Thomas, the tenor, on a program that also includes works by Goossens, Ireland and Bax. Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Allan Kozinn) * CONTINUUM (Tuesday) The Israel Philharmonic recently played two concerts in New York without offering music by a single Israeli composer. For that, you have to turn to Continuum, which is looking at Israeli music, with an emphasis on works by immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The composers represented include Josef Bardanashvili, Michael Liebman, Benjamin Yusupov, Uri Brener, Valentin Bibik and Hana Ajiashvili. At 8 p.m., the J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (646) 505-5708, continuum-ensemble-ny.org; $15. (Kozinn) PHILIP GLASS AND WENDY SUTTER (Tuesday) As part of the Baryshnikov Arts Center's Movado Hour series of free, informal concerts, the composer and pianist Philip Glass and the cellist Wendy Sutter are collaborating on a program of Mr. Glass's music, including the premiere of his ''Songs and Poems'' for cello.

(Kozinn) HUNGARIAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) Welcome to the brave new world of arts sponsorship in the ex-East Bloc: while on this 100-year-old orchestra's first United States tour, its conductor announced during a concert that the ensemble had lost its main sponsor and would be dissolving. (Distressed spinmeisters countered that it would only be shrinking into a chamber ensemble.) So tomorrow may be both a first and a last chance for New Yorkers to hear this particular survivor of Central European tradition in Liszt's Second Piano Concerto (with Paavali Jumppanen), Dvorak's mighty Eighth Symphony and Mussorgsky's ''Night on Bald Mountain.'' At 8 p.m., Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100, tillescenter.org; $48 to $90; $3 off for 65+. (Midgette) * JOHANNES STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The members of this acclaimed quartet make time in their busy outside careers to perform together. Peter Stumpf is the principal cellist of the Los Angles Philharmonic, and C. J. Chang is the principal violist of the Philadelphia Orchestra. The violinists are both based in New York: Soovin Kim, the first American to win the Paganini Violin Competition in 24 years, and Jessica Lee, who won the 2005 Concert Artists Guild International Competition. Music lovers can hear them at a bargain price tomorrow when the essential Peoples' Symphony Concerts presents the quartet in works by Beethoven, Schubert and Mozart. At 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9. (Tommasini) JENNIFER KOH (Wednesday) The dynamic violinist Jennifer Koh, who has proven her mettle in repertory from Bach to Ligeti, is a vigorous champion of new music. On Wednesday she will perform the New York premiere of Jennifer Higdon's ''String Poetic,'' which was written for Ms. Koh and the pianist Reiko Uchida, her frequent collaborator. The lively program also includes Janacek's Sonata, Schubert's Sonatina in D and Schumann's Sonata No. 2. Ms. Koh will also perform excerpts from Kurtag's ''Signs, Games and Messages.'' At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40; $25 for age 35 and under. (Schweitzer) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT (Tonight) The Metropolitan Museum's resident chamber group -- Andrew Armstrong, pianist; Colin Jacobsen and Yosuke Kawasaki, violinists; Nicholas Cords, violist; and Edward Arron and Raman Ramakrishnan, cellists -- opens its season with an eclectic program. Included are a Purcell Fantasia, a Boccherini String Quintet, the Brahms F minor Piano Quintet and a recent work, ''Viaggio in Italia,'' by the Italian post-Minimalist Giovanni Sollima. At 8, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $30. (Kozinn) * MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Finnish conductor Osmo Vanska has helped make the Minnesota Orchestra one of the most compelling in America right now, not least with a vivid Beethoven symphony cycle on CD that's satisfying, fresh, and continuing. (Symphonies 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 have all been released.) Beethoven's delightful and underplayed Fourth Symphony and his classic Fifth feature on consecutive nights in concerts that balance them against the fourth and fifth symphonies of Mr. Vanska's compatriot Jean Sibelius. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $88 (Midgette) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Piano fans, rejoice. This weekend offers a chance to hear the conductor Alan Gilbert, whose sobriquet is morphing from ''rising'' to simply ''hot,'' in Debussy's ''Images''; a piece called ''Parodos'' by Daniel Börtz, a Swedish composer; and Beethoven's first piano concerto with the soloist Lars Vogt. Next week, Lorin Maazel leads off the orchestra's Brahms festival with the Serenade No. 1 and the first piano concerto as played by Emanuel Ax. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $99. (Midgette) ORCHESTRA OF ST.

Built in 1996 in a style similar to those of north Germany and the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries, St. Thomas's Taylor & Boody organ is ideal for such a venture. At 4 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013; saintthomaschurch.org; free. (Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * BIG DANCE THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow) Annie-B Parsons and Paul Lazar, Big's wildly imaginative choreographer and director, explore the stories of the contemporary novelist Masuji Ibuse just in time for the start of Japan Society's celebration of its yearlong centennial.

(Dunning) DanceBrazil (Tuesday through Thursday) Jelon Vieira, the artistic director of this vibrant company from Bahia, has been particularly successful at fusing the techniques of capoeira, the Afro-Brazilian martial art, with modern dance forms. To celebrate the company's 30th anniversary, he has created a new work, ''The Ritual of the Roda,'' that traces the history of capoeira; the kickboxing fireworks artfully transformed into dance should be well worth seeing. (Through Feb. 18.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42; Joyce members, $32.

(Dunning) * D D DORVILLIER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Dorvillier describes her new ''Nottthing Is Importanttt'' as a cinema performance, incorporating video and a ''dark and sound environment.'' Whatever all that means, Ms. Dorvillier's wild, intuitive and visual imagination is usually reason enough to take the plunge. Tonight at 10:30, tomorrow at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $12. (Dunning) Alex Escalante (Thursday) A new trio, ''Swallow Sand,'' by Mr. Escalante, has a live score by Jon Moniaci. According to press materials, the piece features an installation of hundreds of copper tin cans and ''investigates social desensitization bought on by a hyper frenetic environment.'' Would that be New York? (Through next Friday.) At 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500, dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+.

(Dunning) Regina Nejman & Company (Thursday) Ms. Nejman's new ''Frozen Baby'' is described as a ''dance installation,'' which might indicate that there won't be too much dancing. But Ms. Nejman is a choreographer who revels in sheer physicality, and there should be plenty of high-energy movement to watch. The work is set to commissioned music by Mio Morales, whose last score for Ms. Nejman was a compelling mix of Brazilian pop and sharp electronic rhythyms. (Through Feb. 18.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 334-7479; $20; $17 for students. (Sulcas) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Thursday) The company's marketers have devised snappy titles for 10 winter season repertory programs. But words appear to have failed them when it came to tonight's collection of ballets, repeated on Sunday and Thursday, which is rather dully called ''Contemporary Quartet.'' It consists of ''Carousel (A Dance),'' ''Intermezzo No. 1,'' ''Slice to Sharp'' and ''Friandises.'' No matter. We still have ''Balanchine and Robbins: Masters at Work'' (''Serenade,'' ''Dybbuk'' and ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto,'' tomorrow afternoon); ''Essential Balanchine'' (''Square Dance,'' ''Liebeslieder Waltzer'' and ''Stars and Stripes,'' tomorrow night); ''Visionary Voices'' (''Klavier,'' ''Russian Seasons'' and ''The Four Temperaments,'' on Tuesday) and ''For the Fun of It'' (''Circus Polka,'' ''Walpurgisnacht Ballet,'' ''Jeu de Cartes'' and ''Firebird,'' on Wednesday).

Ms. Sigman has a reputation for quirky originality that she seems to be about to live up to. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 7.30 p.m., Danspace Project, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15; $10 for members.

Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith) * Chelsea Art Museum: 'DANGEROUS BEAUTY,' through April 21. A timely update of a well-worn idea, this show of contemporary works in a variety of mediums by 18 artists examines the beauty myth in art, advertising and the fashion industry. Eloquent but blunt imagery of anorexic girls, chiseled male beefcake and close-ups of surgically deformed faces predominates, reminding us of the violent extremes to which some people will go in pursuit of society's ideal of beauty. The rest of the show -- often pointing an accusatory finger at skinny models, cosmetic labels and the mass media -- feels familiar in its critique, but the premise about the ideology of beauty is beyond argument. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719, chelseaartmuseum.org. (Benjamin Genocchio) * Grey Art Gallery: 'Semina Culture: Wallace Berman & His Circle,' through March 31. The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) may ring only a faint bell to many New Yorkers, but he was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780. (Holland Cotter) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Henri Cartier-Bresson's Scrapbook: Photographs, 1932-46,' through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It's an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. He became a celebrity in America. He photographed Fred Astaire dancing and Joan Crawford poolside. In the breezy layouts of Harper's Bazaar, the work looked brilliant. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. The 100 paintings and drawings on display here are by 10 artists, including George Grosz, Christian Schad and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble; we look into the faces of museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * The MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) Morgan Library & Museum: 'Private Treasures: Four Centuries of European Master Drawings,' through April 8. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The works span more than 400 years, from the 16th to the early 20th century, and include drawings in ink and pencil, watercolor, chalk and gouache. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn't an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one's craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example is a black chalk drawing, ''The Dead Christ'' (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don't know where they came from, where they're going or when you'll see them again. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Martha Schwendener) Storefront for Art and Architecture: 'Clip/Stamp/Fold,' through Feb. 24. This show examines the world of those small magazines from the early 1960s to the end of the 1970s, when the field of architecture was still marked by a playful intellectual and political independence. Often thrown together on a shoestring budget, the magazines have an intoxicating freshness that should send a shudder down the spine of those who've spent the last decade in the glow of the computer screen. But this is not an exercise in nostalgia. It's a piercing critique, intended or not, of the smoothness of our contemporary design culture. These magazine covers map out an era when architecture was simmering with new ideas. You're bound to leave the show with a nagging sense of what was lost as well as gained during the last three decades. 97 Kenmare Street, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) Galleries: Chelsea * JACCO OLIVIER Yet another painter working in animation might seem a little tiresome. But these wistful filmed animations of loosely brushed seascapes and landscapes by Mr. Olivier are perfectly lovely. It is no revelation that he is from the Netherlands -- Dutch artists more or less invented landscape imagery in the late 16th century. This artist updates the genr. The imagery is marvelously painterly, with the individual frames sometimes bordering on abstraction, though the narrative structure owes much to the techniques of film. Mr. Olivier's peculiar genius is to have effortlessly combined them. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street, (212) 680-9889, www.marianneboeskygallery.com, through Feb. 17. (Genocchio) Last Chance * COSMOLOGIES This flawed but also irresistible survey of the longstanding human desire to account for the universe in a holistic, often holy manner ranges eclectically across continents, centuries, mediums and religions. Its nearly 70 objects and artworks include African ritual objects, Tibetan and Mongolian mandalas, rare European prints and books and the efforts of over 30 contemporary artists. Unsurprisingly, the circle is the dominant form here, which befits the way you may find yourself orbiting through the panoply of material. James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 714-9500; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * Freeman/Phelan: 'The Long Goodbye' As a collaborative duo, Jonah Freeman and Michael Phelan turn the American cultural landscape into a kind of job lot shop of the damned. Synthetic carpeting heaves across the gallery floor. Glass display cases display only themselves. Pictures that look abstract and a little Chinese-y are actually photographs of aluminum foil. Some interesting young artists are turning design into a lethal critical weapon, and Mr. Freeman and Mr. Phelan are two of them. Josh Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9563, johnconnellypresents.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * 'Material for the Making' This auspicious first show organized by Elizabeth Dee's new director, Jenny Moore, has work by four good artists. Mai Brau's heap of shredded newspaper is a realistically undecipherable edition of the news of the day. Gail Thacker's sequential Polaroids of a dancing man covered in shaving cream is Dada Eadweard Muybridge. Kori Newkirk fills a wall with a giant snowflake painted in pomade. An eerie video by Kerry Tribe recreates, in sonambulistic shock-time, the experience of a car accident in a snow storm. Elizabeth Dee, 545 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 942-7545, elizabethdeegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * CARRIE MOYER: THE STONE AGE, NEW PAINTINGS Although a little cautious, Ms. Moyer's new paintings have a bracing visual and conceptual complexity. Feminism, biology, geology, prehistoric goddesses and vessels are evoked in thin, precisely calibrated layers that add new twists to both the geometry and the gesturalism of male-dominated formalist painting. It's post-political abstraction. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * Museum of Modern Art: 'DOUG AITKEN: SLEEPWALKERS' Produced in concert with Creative Time Inc., this monumental video projection, screened nightly (from 5 to 10) on three sides of the sleek exterior of the newly expanded Museum of Modern Art, consists of short, silent and rather too glamorous meditations on the working nights of five emblematic New Yorkers played somnolently by actors and musicians who include Donald Sutherland and Tilda Swinton. But Mr. Aitken's astute and restless cinematic ambition and commanding sense of scale are in full force, especially in the more abstract portions of the piece, resulting in a fitting ode to the city that never sleeps and that the camera has always loved. (212) 708-9400; closes on Monday. (Smith) * Stephen G. Rhodes: 'Recurrency' It's great when someone gets ambitiously complicated and makes it work, as the young Los Angeles-based artist Stephen G. Rhodes does in his first solo show. Formally, he juggles video, sculpture, photographs and drawings, and hooks them up in a circling narrative that ricochets from 19th-century fiction to B films to Hurricane Katrina. The play of history, fiction and recent reality that results is memorably atmospheric. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224, www.guildgreyshkul.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Saul Steinberg: works from the 50's-80's Steinberg's side-winding art may be in full cry at the Morgan Library, but this wonderful short-form retrospective doesn't skimp. Ranging from the early 1950s to the late 1980s, its 40 objects include one of the artist's studio-table sculptures, accoutered with whittled versions of tools and works-in-progress and a facsimile of his many notebooks that feels like the real thing, especially since it can be handled. Adam Baumgold Gallery, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005' Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)",

Average one-way international fares continued a four-year climb, to $1,707, and average international daily hotel rates rose for the fifth consecutive year, to $230. Average daily car rental rates crept up again, to $69. Corporate pressure on business travelers to comply with booking policies held down the rate of increases, said Mike Streit, vice president of American Express Business Travel Advisory Services. The average air fare rates were calculated from hundreds of domestic and international routes negotiated for corporate clients by American Express, from discount coach to first class. The average rate for car rentals includes fuel, taxes and other charges. Among domestic hotels, average nightly rates rose most sharply in the cheapest niche, the budget category, to $179 in the fourth quarter of 2006 from $150 in the comparable 2005 quarter.",2007/03/27
