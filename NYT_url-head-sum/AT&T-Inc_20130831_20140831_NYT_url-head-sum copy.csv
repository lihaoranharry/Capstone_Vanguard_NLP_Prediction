He was 41 years old. He was a father, husband, son, brother, friend, accomplished builder, sea captain, big wave surfer, philanthropist, saltwater fisherman, snowboarder, soccer and hockey player. He is survived by his wife, Uli (Ulrike) De Vreese Martinez, his daughters, Juliana De Vreese Martinez, 7, and Esmee Nicolina Martinez, 4, his parents, Antonia Viatori Martinez and Albert A.

Mark was recognized by colleagues, friends and family members for his honest nature and can-do attitude. There was never an obstacle that Mark didn't meet with a smile and tackle with vigor, determination and grace. His unique style and presence, especially in the face of challenges others would have shied away from, distinguished him as an individual. Doing good by doing right was his way. Mark was defined by generosity and fierce loyalty. Mark invested 100% of himself into everything he committed to - his family, friends, sports and business. Family was paramount for Mark. Mark was a resident of both Manhattan and Southampton, NY. He was born in Rochester, NY on November 7th, 1972. Mark grew up in Rumson, NJ where he attended Rumson Country Day School, Rumson Fair Haven High School and ultimately matriculated to UNC Wilmington, where he was a member of the Chi Phi fraternity. Professionally, Mark built upon the foundation that his father created when he assumed responsibility of Interior Management, Inc (IMI). He had a specific vision for the company, focused on quality workmanship and culture, and has grown the business into Manhattan, the Hamptons, and New Jersey's foremost construction and renovation partner. A Memorial Visitation will be held at Frank E. Campbell at 1076 Madison Ave. Monday January 27th from 4pm-9pm.

The board and staff of the Tinker Foundation Incorporated mourn the passing of its former Chairman and President, Martha T. Muse. She died on Sunday, February 9th, in Stuart, Florida after a brief illness. Martha was born in Dallas, Texas in 1926, the daughter of John Blackburn Muse and Kathryn Poole Burbank, but lived in New York City for most of her life. She maintained residences in New York City, Connecticut and Florida. Her principal interests focused on Latin America, but she contributed substantially to educational, corporate and non-profit areas. Martha was a founding director of the Tinker Foundation. She served as its president for 27 years and its chairman for 33 years, retiring in 2008. It was under her direction that the Foundation became a leading funder of Latin American-related activities providing support for educational, environmental, security, economic, legal and governance issues. Martha received her undergraduate degree from Barnard College in 1948 and a master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1955. In 1981 she received an honorary doctorate from Georgetown University. She was the first woman elected as a trustee to Columbia University and was among the first women named to the Board of the New York Stock Exchange and the Council on Foreign Relations. She served on numerous corporate boards including The Bank of New York, May Department Stores, Sterling Drug Inc., ASARCO, ACF Industries and Associated Dry Goods. Her non-profit boards included the Americas Society, the Spanish Institute, and the Luso-American Development Foundation. For her many contributions to the field of Latin American relations she received numerous awards: Orden del Sol del Peru, Order of Bernardo O'Higgins (Chile), Order de Mayo al Merito (Argentina); Ordem Nacional do Cruzeiro do Sul (Brazil), and awards from the Spanish Institute and the Americas Society. She was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Colony Club, the Huguenot Society and the National Society of Colonial Dames. One of her final directives to the Tinker Foundation was incorporating Antarctica-related subjects under its funding mandate. Her support of Antarctica was recognized in 2009 by the establishment of the Muse Prize for Science and Policy in Antarctica, an award for mid-career Antarctic scientists and policy makers. A memorial service will be held in New York City in the late spring. Letters of inquiry and condolence may be sent to the Tinker Foundation, 55 E. 59th St., New York, NY 10022.<br><br>"

Pete passed away peacefully on the evening of November 19, 2013 in Chatham, New Jersey. Pete was well known and loved by many and lived a rich and rewarding life. The son of Elliston Perot Bissell, Jr. and Ann Packard Bissell, Pete was born In Jamaica Queens New York on May 26th, 1935. He spent his early years in Morristown, New Jersey and Haverford, Pennsylvania. He attended the Episcopal School in Philadelphia and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire in 1953. Pete attended Harvard College, where he majored in Biochemical Sciences. While at Harvard he was a member of the Hasty Pudding, Lampoon, and President of the Phoenix-S.K. After graduating from Harvard in 1957, Pete joined the US Navy as a junior lieutenant. He was married to Edith (Edie) Mabelle Roach of Newtown Square, Pennsylvania in March 1958. Pete and Edie spent the early years of their marriage in Japan while he was stationed at the Yokosuka Naval base attached to a naval intelligence unit. After his discharge from active duty in 1961, Pete continued to serve in the Naval Reserves for 30 years and retired with the rank of Commander. Following his return to Philadelphia in 1961, Pete went to work for Pennsylvania Bell. Pete had a long and distinguished career at AT&T and its predecessor companies including vice president of Diamond State Telephone Company, working in AT&T's international division, and finally serving in AT&T's global strategy group. His career took him to many interesting places including living in Egypt from 1982 to 1984. He also gained recognition through obtaining two patents for proprietary telecommunication devices. Pete retired in from AT&T in 1997. In addition to his work, Pete played a very active role in numerous community organizations including the Kiwanis in Norristown, Pennsylvania, the Rotary Club of Wilmington, Delaware (serving as President in 1981), the Opportunity Center, Inc (a group that seek to educate and help the disabled), and the Urban League of Wilmington. Pete will be remembered fondly by the many lives he touched. He was always willing to lend a helping hand or provide sage advice. Pete had many hobbies gardening, HO Gage trains, model building, furniture making, bridge, military history, fine wine collecting, and painting lead soldiers. An avid golfer, he was a member of the Merion Golf Club, Pine Valley Golf Club, and the Morris County Golf Club. He was also a member of the Morristown Club. Pete was well known as a bon-vivant and a humorous raconteur! After nearly 40 years of happy marriage, Edie passed away.

Anne, Senior Vice President of Emblem Health, a New York based Health insurance Company, had been living and working in NYC for a little over a year. After a successful career with AT&T, she retired in 1998 to pursue other interests, including a short period with Michigan Consolidate Gas and Gen Three in Boston. Anne then came to the Healthcare industry with leadership positions at WellPoint, where she was responsible for the rollout of their Medicare Part D product, then DaVita Inc. with their Home Healthcare Division and finally with Emblem Health where she was responsible for Operations and IT. Anne remained in NYC during Hurricane Sandy to help keep Emblem's IT systems operational as power was lost and backups restored. She is survived by her husband of 23 years, Bruce Cooke, daughter, Victoria Cooke, Williamsburg, VA and sisters, Mary Nell Ryan, Milwaukee, WI, and Jeanne Ryan, Duluth, MN. Anne grew up in the suburbs of Milwaukee, was a nationally ranked swimmer in high school, and then attended St. Catherine University, St. Paul, MN, graduating in 1980 with honors and member of Phi Beta Kappa. Anne felt her greatest work satisfaction came in the Health Industry; a colleague who worked with her at Emblem can best describe her in the quote below: ""Anne was inspirational, honest, and genuine. In speaking with many other people about Anne they each felt important and full of purpose after meeting her and hearing her vigor for life and dedication to transforming our organization. And she did just that; transform it. She held others accountable and required nothing but the best from each of us. I am a better person and stronger leader because of her. God bless.""

He was 90. ""Anthony Mazzola was a dynamic member of the Hearst Magazines family for more than 65 years,"" said Steven R. Swartz, president and CEO, Hearst Corporation. ""Tony will be missed by everyone who had the pleasure of working with him."" Frank A. Bennack, Jr., former CEO and now executive vice chairman of Hearst Corporation, added, ""Tony Mazzola's contributions to Harper's BAZAAR and Town&Country have not only influenced those titles as they appear even today but our entire magazine business."" Mazzola, the editor who defined affluence and style for millions of readers at the two magazines for 44 years, started his career at Hearst as an art director. In 1948, at the age of 25, Mazzola joined Town&Country as the youngest art director in the magazine's history. He held that post for nearly two decades, ultimately becoming editor in chief in 1965. Town&Country is the longest continuously published general-interest magazine in America, having been founded in 1846. ""Tony Mazzola was one of the most creative editors I've known,"" said Hearst Corporation Director Gilbert C. Maurer. ""A man of great personal style, he intuitively knew what good looked like and his work at Town&Country and Harper's BAZAAR reflected that acute sensibility. Tony was a loyal friend as well as a valuable mentor to a generation of our younger talents."" Building on what he once described as his ""fascination with trends,"" Mazzola's Town&Country began to reflect the current events and social reorganization then affecting elite American society as the nation mourned the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and grappled with civil rights, the Vietnam War and the first stirrings of modern-day feminism. Mazzola said he was captivated ""not by what's happening, but why."" While still the magazine's art director in 1964, he published a tongue-in-cheek ""It's Fun to Be Rich"" issue. In 1966, his first year as Town&Country's editor in chief, he put the Rolling Stones on the cover of what was widely held to be the bible of conservative, blue-blooded America. The ensuing controversy prompted Hearst's executives to ask him, ""Young man, do you know what you're doing?"" ""I think so,"" he replied. In fact, Mazzola did: By maintaining a meticulous balance between creating an exciting magazine and conveying the dignity of the subjects he presented, he broadened Town&Country's appeal and honored its audience. ""People make fun of money,"" he once said, ""but everyone forgets the good that money has done."" In 1972, Mazzola was appointed editor in chief of Harper's BAZAAR and expanded his editorial style even further. He relished the opportunity to widen the magazine's scope, which he again did in 1983 by adapting its pages to reflect newly emerging trends such as the more mature, sophisticated fashions--and celebrities--of the time, and readers' increasing interest in lifestyle, as well as fashion, content. ""We love the handle of being the fashion magazine with a little salt and pepper added,"" he said of BAZAAR in a 1983 interview. ""We appeal to a woman with a very strong confidence level, who is sure of herself, not wishy-washy. She wants to know everything there is to know...and we have become the fashion and beauty book with personality, the one with heart."" At the end of the decade, Mazzola again redesigned the magazine, this time to appeal to readers as they matured from trendy to classic tastes. Striving for what he called a ""very unconventional, exciting visual product,"" Mazzola encouraged photographers such as Francesco Scavullo, Rico Puhlmann and Matthew Rolston to take dramatic, even abstract approaches to fashion. One result was a celebrated shot described by a writer as ""a woman and a cabbage leaf facing off"" to illustrate a story on vegetable dyes used in hair coloring. After he stepped down as editor in chief in 1992, Mazzola edited BAZAAR's 125th anniversary book in 1993. The project was both professionally and personally rewarding. ""Reliving the history of this great magazine and knowing that I had a role in it is a great privilege,"" he said. In 1995, he was editorial director of Town&Country's two-volume 150th anniversary book. Mazzola was also the fine arts curator for Hearst Corporation, whose fine art collection emphasizes works on paper and emerging talents, many of whom have become household names since the collection was started. In addition to curating and cataloguing the collection, he produced many art and photography shows for Hearst Tower. Mazzola graduated from The Cooper Union with honors in 1948 and received The Cooper Union's distinguished alumni citation in 1992. After beginning study at The Cooper Union, he was drafted into World War II. His art background prompted an assignment to army intelligence, where he analyzed camouflage. He was awarded a Bronze Star for ""meritorious achievement in connection with military operations against the enemy in Luzon, Philippine Islands."" A recipient of numerous awards in the art direction and design fields, Mazzola was inducted as a Knight Officer of the Order of Merit by the Republic of Italy in 1967. He also served as a consultant and designer for such organizations as the United Nations Children's Fund, the Association of Junior Leagues of America, Princess Marcella Borghese, Inc., General Foods, Columbia Pictures, Inc. and the New York World's Fair of 1965. Mazzola is survived by his wife, Michele Morgan Mazzola, who worked with him at Hearst for over 45 years, and three children, Alisa Mazzola Mitchell, Marc Mazzola and Tony Mazzola. He is also survived by five grandchildren. There will be a private funeral in Indiana, and a memorial in New York at a future date. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, PO Box 27106, New York, NY 10087-7105 or http://www.mskcc.org/giving)."

In speaking with many other people about Anne they each felt important and full of purpose after meeting her and hearing her vigor for life and dedication to transforming our organization. And she did just that; transform it. She held others accountable and required nothing but the best from each of us. I am a better person and stronger leader because of her. God bless.""

Martha was born in Dallas, Texas in 1926, the daughter of John Blackburn Muse and Kathryn Poole Burbank, but lived in New York City for most of her life.

She served as its president for 27 years and its chairman for 33 years, retiring in 2008. It was under her direction that the Foundation became a leading funder of Latin American-related activities providing support for educational, environmental, security, economic, legal and governance issues. Martha received her undergraduate degree from Barnard College in 1948 and a master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1955.

She was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Colony Club, the Huguenot Society and the National Society of Colonial Dames.

He was 90. ""Anthony Mazzola was a dynamic member of the Hearst Magazines family for more than 65 years,"" said Steven R. Swartz, president and CEO, Hearst Corporation. ""Tony will be missed by everyone who had the pleasure of working with him."" Frank A. Bennack, Jr., former CEO and now executive vice chairman of Hearst Corporation, added, ""Tony Mazzola's contributions to Harper's BAZAAR and Town&Country have not only influenced those titles as they appear even today but our entire magazine business."" Mazzola, the editor who defined affluence and style for millions of readers at the two magazines for 44 years, started his career at Hearst as an art director. In 1948, at the age of 25, Mazzola joined Town&Country as the youngest art director in the magazine's history. He held that post for nearly two decades, ultimately becoming editor in chief in 1965. Town&Country is the longest continuously published general-interest magazine in America, having been founded in 1846. ""Tony Mazzola was one of the most creative editors I've known,"" said Hearst Corporation Director Gilbert C. Maurer. ""A man of great personal style, he intuitively knew what good looked like and his work at Town&Country and Harper's BAZAAR reflected that acute sensibility. Tony was a loyal friend as well as a valuable mentor to a generation of our younger talents."" Building on what he once described as his ""fascination with trends,"" Mazzola's Town&Country began to reflect the current events and social reorganization then affecting elite American society as the nation mourned the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and grappled with civil rights, the Vietnam War and the first stirrings of modern-day feminism. Mazzola said he was captivated ""not by what's happening, but why."" While still the magazine's art director in 1964, he published a tongue-in-cheek ""It's Fun to Be Rich"" issue. In 1966, his first year as Town&Country's editor in chief, he put the Rolling Stones on the cover of what was widely held to be the bible of conservative, blue-blooded America. The ensuing controversy prompted Hearst's executives to ask him, ""Young man, do you know what you're doing?"" ""I think so,"" he replied. In fact, Mazzola did: By maintaining a meticulous balance between creating an exciting magazine and conveying the dignity of the subjects he presented, he broadened Town&Country's appeal and honored its audience. ""People make fun of money,"" he once said, ""but everyone forgets the good that money has done."" In 1972, Mazzola was appointed editor in chief of Harper's BAZAAR and expanded his editorial style even further. He relished the opportunity to widen the magazine's scope, which he again did in 1983 by adapting its pages to reflect newly emerging trends such as the more mature, sophisticated fashions--and celebrities--of the time, and readers' increasing interest in lifestyle, as well as fashion, content. ""We love the handle of being the fashion magazine with a little salt and pepper added,"" he said of BAZAAR in a 1983 interview. ""We appeal to a woman with a very strong confidence level, who is sure of herself, not wishy-washy. She wants to know everything there is to know...and we have become the fashion and beauty book with personality, the one with heart."" At the end of the decade, Mazzola again redesigned the magazine, this time to appeal to readers as they matured from trendy to classic tastes. Striving for what he called a ""very unconventional, exciting visual product,"" Mazzola encouraged photographers such as Francesco Scavullo, Rico Puhlmann and Matthew Rolston to take dramatic, even abstract approaches to fashion. One result was a celebrated shot described by a writer as ""a woman and a cabbage leaf facing off"" to illustrate a story on vegetable dyes used in hair coloring. After he stepped down as editor in chief in 1992, Mazzola edited BAZAAR's 125th anniversary book in 1993. The project was both professionally and personally rewarding. ""Reliving the history of this great magazine and knowing that I had a role in it is a great privilege,"" he said. In 1995, he was editorial director of Town&Country's two-volume 150th anniversary book. Mazzola was also the fine arts curator for Hearst Corporation, whose fine art collection emphasizes works on paper and emerging talents, many of whom have become household names since the collection was started. In addition to curating and cataloguing the collection, he produced many art and photography shows for Hearst Tower. Mazzola graduated from The Cooper Union with honors in 1948 and received The Cooper Union's distinguished alumni citation in 1992. After beginning study at The Cooper Union, he was drafted into World War II. His art background prompted an assignment to army intelligence, where he analyzed camouflage. He was awarded a Bronze Star for ""meritorious achievement in connection with military operations against the enemy in Luzon, Philippine Islands."" A recipient of numerous awards in the art direction and design fields, Mazzola was inducted as a Knight Officer of the Order of Merit by the Republic of Italy in 1967. He also served as a consultant and designer for such organizations as the United Nations Children's Fund, the Association of Junior Leagues of America, Princess Marcella Borghese, Inc., General Foods, Columbia Pictures, Inc. and the New York World's Fair of 1965. Mazzola is survived by his wife, Michele Morgan Mazzola, who worked with him at Hearst for over 45 years, and three children, Alisa Mazzola Mitchell, Marc Mazzola and Tony Mazzola. He is also survived by five grandchildren. There will be a private funeral in Indiana, and a memorial in New York at a future date.
