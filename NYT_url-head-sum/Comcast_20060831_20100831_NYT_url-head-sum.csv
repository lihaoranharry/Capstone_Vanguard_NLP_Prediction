John Buscemi Montana, M.D., gay man, physician, generous humanitarian, New Yorker, world traveler and art aficionado, died at Mt. Sinai Hospital early Monday morning, September 29, 2008. The cause of death was acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), diagnosed less than one year ago. Dr. Montana was one of the first NYC physicians to identify and treat people with AIDS at the outset of the epidemic in 1981. He saw many cases among his friends and the gay men who comprised a large portion of his internal medicine practice on lower Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. Dr. Montana, the son of Vanni Buscemi Montana and Helen Bortnovski Montana, was born in Huntington, Long Island, NY on March 13, 1947. His parents met in Europe during World War II. John's father was politically active in anti-fascist and socialist causes in his native Sicily; he died in 1991. John's own politics reflected his father's leftist leanings. His mother Helene perished in an apartment fire in February, 2003. A product of New York City public schools, Dr. Montana graduated from Harpur College (SUNY Binghamton) in 1969 where he majored in Science and Mathematics. He taught junior high school in Newark, New Jersey for two years before attending medical school. Dr. Montana graduated New York Medical College, Valhalla in 1975. After working at Cabrini-Stuyvesant Polyclinic, he opened his internal medicine practice in 1984. He was an attending physician at Cabrini Medical Center until it closed. Then he attended at St. Vincent's Hospital. Dr. Montana's illness caused him to close his medical practice in mid-December, 2007. The AIDS epidemic motivated him to focus his practice on treating AIDS-related opportunistic infections and cancers--which signaled fatality in less than two years at the beginning of the epidemic. His beloved partner, Jimmie Jackson, died from AIDS early on, and his death both devastated and deeply politicized John to continue the fight against AIDS. A firm proponent of safer-sex, Dr. Montana advised the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) on medical issues from its inception. He lectured on AIDS to community and professional groups throughout the city and was politically involved in ACT-UP and other AIDS-related organizations. John gave generously of his time and money to many gay community organizations including Senior Action in a Gay Environment (SAGE) and the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center. Until the end of his life, he maintained his conviction that the right-wing-dominated, federal government covertly propagated the epidemic, if not intentionally, then by intentional negligence--the ultimate goal being the elimination of the gay community. A gay-civil-rights activist and life-long Democrat, he was horrified at the response of the Reagan and Bush presidencies to AIDS and gay rights issues in general. He became inconsolable when his long-term partner, Daniel C., was deported from this country in 1999. Being bi-lingual, John was a benefactor to many in New York's Latino communities, and especially to Daniel's family. Dr. Montana often visited South America where he was a benefactor to small villages helping poor people at local medical clinics. Dr. Montana was a patron of the arts whether for museum-sponsored projects or for individual, fledgling, gay artists including E. J. Weiss, Ferron Bell and William Schwedler. He especially appreciated the works of Charles Demuth. John loved New York City, but enjoyed traveling throughout Europe and South America. John had many patients and friends in diplomatic positions who hosted him in Brazil, Italy, France, and Spain. Recently he traveled to Turkey, and only two weeks before his death, he returned from a cruise to Venice and Greece with two friends who made his trip as comfortable as possible. He fell critically ill upon his return. John Montana is survived by his brother Victor and his nephew John, both of New Hampshire. He is deeply mourned by his cousins Vicki De Bruin-Tarlow, Carol Daniels, Jesse Kamras, and also by his close friends John Helmuth, Ron Illardo, Philip Kayal, Jim D'Eramo, Patrick Hacker, Joe Nicholson and Angel, who with others, nursed him daily near the end. He is also mourned by his extended family in Finland and Israel, and by his friends throughout the world, but most particularly by the New York City gay community that he shepherded courageously through the AIDS epidemic--Dr. John Montana was an AIDS hero. Dr. Montana's Memorial Service will be Sunday, November 23 at 3:30pm in the Auditorium (10th Floor) of St. Vincents Hospital, 170 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village. Family and friends are welcome.

The league said it would extend the deal beyond April 30 if Comcast would move the network to a far broader digital tier that has nearly nine million subscribers and does not require an extra monthly fee, which the sports tier does. The N.F.L. is insisting that the channel return to where Comcast carried it before the network added eight regular-season games and raised its monthly subscriber fee. That is the focus of the dispute in the Federal Communications Commission and in a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court. The league says Comcast has violated federal laws by relegating it to a sports tier. nflnetwork The Sports Museum of America, which opened in lower Manhattan last May and closed last month, filed a Chapter 7 liquidation petition Friday in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. It cited $55.5 million in assets and $177.1 million in liabilities. Philip Schwalb, the museum's founder, said he was still hopeful of a sale to a ''good, credible buyer.''

The new host on ''The Good Night Show,'' Michele Lepe, plays an undercover policewoman who poses as a prostitute in a short independent picture, ''Jamaica Motel.'' Last summer the channel fired the original host, Melanie Martinez, because seven years ago she acted in videos spoofing public service announcements advocating sexual abstinence. Sprout, a joint venture of the Public Broadcasting System, Comcast, Hit Entertainment and Sesame Workshop, said at the time that Ms. Martinez's earlier role might ''undermine her character's credibility with our audience.'' A parenting blog, the Zero Boss, accused Sprout of ''hypocrisy'' for hiring Ms. Lepe after firing Ms. Martinez. PBS's ombudsman, Michael Getler, wrote in recent columns that he had received complaints from viewers, and that while he hadn't seen ''Jamaica Motel,'' Sprout's ''decision-making here looks to me to be inconsistent.''

The cable guys were outraged because the Big Ten wanted a dollar per subscriber per month -- nearly triple the price commanded by, say, CNN or the USA Network -- and was further demanding a primo spot on extended basic, which is where everybody who starts a network wants to be. For their part, the cable companies wanted to relegate the Big Ten Network to a sports tier, where the fans who watched the games would also be the ones who pay for them. For the record, while I do not believe in a la carte cable pricing, I do think that sports should be treated as an exception: sports channels are so expensive -- ESPN alone is some $3 a month a subscriber -- that it is the single biggest reason your cable bill is so high.
