Penzias, the Nobel laureate who directs research at this most famous of American corporate laboratories, grouses: why didn't the caller use electronic mail instead? Voice can be so retrograde, so intrusive. Penzias gets up and switches phones to demonstrate one of his latest toys, something the Bell Labs engineers call ""Bump in a Cord."" It is an eavesdropper-foiling encryption device the size of a paperback book, and it works so well, he says, that the Government will not allow it carried out of the country (""Princess Di would love one"").

Clearwater birdied the last seven holes -- averaging more than 20 feet a putt while falling one short of the PGA Tour record -- for a 61 on the 7,010-yard Colonial course.

""And the program is still young,"" a Government spokesman said, with hope. The payments are funneled to institutions made insolvent by the S.& L. crisis. At P.& .G, Profit Follows Flub The lesson may be to stick to soap. Tarnished by a $102 million loss in its third quarter from bad derivatives investments, Procter & Gamble regained some shine last week, announcing net earnings of $406 million in its fourth quarter. At 56 cents a share -- up 12 cents from the comparable quarter last year, excluding adjustments -- the results impressed analysts and spurred P.& G.'s chief, Edwin L. Artzt, to write the tale's epitome. ""This was a good year,"" he said, ""and if not for the derivatives it would have been a great year."" Even more notable: P.& G. achieved its results despite sales not much higher than a year ago. Internet: New Way to Spend! Credit card issuers rejoiced last week when some young, intrepid entrepreneurs successfully conducted the first secure retail transaction on the Internet, the global computer network. ""Secure"" is the key word; without a practical way to keep credit card numbers confidential, businesses will balk at turning the Internet into a major marketplace. Using a scrambling technique known as data encryption, though, tiny Net Market Company of Nashua, N.H., has solved the problem. And what was the pioneering purchase? A compact disk, ""Ten Summoners' Tales,"" by rock musician Sting. Price: $12.48 plus shipping. Disney Turns Interactive Built on imagination, the Disney company had nonetheless envisioned little future for itself on the information superhighway. Until last week, that is, when the company announced a venture with three Baby Bells -- Ameritech, BellSouth and Southwestern Bell -- to offer video services to homes. The venture is still vague, with no word on how ownership or profits will be split, but the Bells' reach to 50 million customers in 19 states makes the deal's potential broad. That is, if Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, has really discarded his well-known disdain for the superhighway and believes, as Tinkerbell would surely hope. Valdez Catch: $287 Million About 10,000 Alaskan fishermen reeled in nearly $287 million in damages from Exxon last week, courtesy of a Federal jury deliberating over the Valdez oil spill of 1989. But the compensatory award was much closer to Exxon's damage estimate of $113 million than to the fishermen's $895 million goal -- and that's how the paid parties saw it. ""It's not what I wanted,"" said the plaintiffs' lead lawyer. But it's not over till it's over, and the jury in Anchorage will next consider whether Exxon should pay punitive damages for the mishap. The plaintiffs are asking for a whopper: $15 billion. INTERNATIONAL Rockwell, Russia in Air Plan Faster and safer are an odd mix in the world of transportation, but that's what Rockwell International and Russia's aviation-research agency expect from their plan to modernize the nation's air-traffic control system. Announced in Moscow last week, the project will eventually trim hours from flights between the United States and the Far East, and enhance safety by enabling planes near or over Russia to rely upon both Russian and American navigational satellites. True, it's yet one more story about the cold war's demise, but there's a kicker. Rockwell is getting $4.7 million in financing -- from the Defense Department. For Kenneth A. Medlin, a Rockwell executive vice president, the deal represents ""defense conversion at its very best."" China Lands a Boeing Deal When Boeing announced it would invest $100 million in a Chinese plant to make the tail sections of its most popular plane -- the 737 -- the reasons were several and self-evident. One, China is a big Boeing fan, with 52 of the nation's 79 plane purchases last year coming from the Seattle manufacturer. Two, China is looming ever larger on Boeing's ledgers, with 14 percent of the company's 1994 deliveries destined for that fast-emerging market. And three, Boeing competitors Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas are also energetically investing in China and chatting up the Chinese. Uncounted was Wichita, Kan., where the 737 tail sections are currently made. But to union complaints that last week's deal hurts American workers, Boeing just pointed to reasons 1, 2 and 3. THE ECONOMY Greenspan's Secret: Stories How do Alan Greenspan and his Federal Reserve colleagues divine where inflation is headed? Complex computer models? Reams of statistics? Forecasting formulas? In part, yes, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week, but there are also . . . stories. The Federal Reserve chairman used a dressed-up phrase, ""detailed readings of firm behavior,"" but he essentially meant stories -- stories from companies, trade groups and others about rising prices. Changes in the American economy and statistics' assumptions about economic relationships makes mere data insufficient for decision making, Mr. Greenspan said. Prices Up, Sales Down, Be Wary Alan Greenspan's reliance on stories (see above) was vindicated last week, when the Government's July figures for producer prices and retail sales were released -- and at once were labeled misleading. Producer or ""finished goods"" prices rose half a percentage point, but the rise came mainly from coffee and gasoline prices, not from the prices that make the inflation-wary Federal Reserve snap to. And while retail sales fell one-tenth of a percentage point in July, the drop did not mean consumers wanted to buy less. It just mirrored auto makers' difficulty in restocking car lots that buyers had picked clean last spring. Fittingly, the deceptive data just ""adds to the ambiguity"" of whether the Fed will raise interest rates, said one economist. Companies Tapped for Wiretaps The electronic frontier needs sheriffs like any other, and the F.B.I. says bills introduced in Congress last week will give it the technological draw on cyberspace bandits. Under the proposals, telephone and cable companies must alter their networks to make wiretapping easier, and they will get $500 million in Federal money to pay for the modifications. Company executives were reluctant to be deputies in the deal, however; one testified that $500 million is ""severely underestimated."" The true costs are ""very, very difficult"" to come by, agreed the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh. But, he warned, ""I certainly know what the cost of not proceeding will be."" Info Highway: No Traffic Jam? It all depends. That's the answer to the commercially pressing question of how many people ride the Internet, the global computer network. Cyberspace demographers often say 20 million to 30 million, but when Network Wizards, of Menlo Park, Calif., counted 3.2 million computers on the Internet in a survey last week, doubts arose. Not over the machines, but over how many people use each of them. About 10 people per machine is a common assumption; it underpins the 20 million to 30 million estimate. But some revisionists now say 3.5 people per machine, and some say 5 to 10. Riding on it all: how many potential buyers pass by the electronic storefronts that businesses are now scrambling to build.",1994/08/14
