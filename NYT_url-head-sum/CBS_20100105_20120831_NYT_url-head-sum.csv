(CBS) A HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS WITH MARTINA McBRIDE Ms. McBride, above, hosts this annual concert dedicated to promoting adoption and telling uplifting stories about children who found families. Between musical performances from Mary J. Blige, Justin Bieber, Gavin DeGraw and others, families that have adopted discuss the experience. One story is from the Hendersons of Helena, Ala., who were inspired to adopt their daughter Brittney after watching a previous presentation of ''A Home for the Holidays.'' Denise Richards, who adopted her daughter Eloise, will also reflect on her decision. 4 P.M. (Showtime2) DORIAN GRAY (2009) Claiming his inheritance, Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) moves into a home in Victorian London, where he meets the aristocrat and dissolute hedonist Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth), who corrupts the newcomer into joining his lifestyle of wild abandon. To keep the good times from stopping, Dorian wishes to preserve his youthful looks forever, so he makes a deal with the devil: for the price of his soul he will show no signs of aging, but a painted portrait of him will reflect the toll of time and a life of indulgence. The portrait becomes as grotesque as his excesses, and when Dorian falls in love with a woman, he must keep the painting a secret. The movie is based on a novel by Oscar Wilde.",

So much so that they watched in awe, half a world away, as two Twitter users saved a team on ''The Amazing Race'' from being kicked off the CBS show. The 19th season of the race-around-the-world reality show had just started taping in June in Southern California when one of the contestants, Kaylani Paliotta, unknowingly left her passport at a gas station. The camera crew with Ms. Paliotta and her teammate, Lisa Tilley, noticed what had been left behind, but could not tell them. Instead, they sent word to producers at the next stop, Los Angeles International Airport, to expect a premature end to the team's race.",

(ABC) EXTREME MAKEOVER: HOME EDITION The series travels to Fayette County, Iowa, to surprise Audrey Gibbs, who, seven months after the death of her husband, had a brain aneurysm that left her legally blind. Doctors cannot predict whether she will lose her sight completely. Unable to continue her work as a cosmetologist, she has become a massage therapist, which doesn't require sight, the better to support her six children. In this, the penultimate episode, Ty Pennington (above, foreground, with Ms. Gibbs) and his crew remodel the family's farmhouse, which has no working toilet and a caved-in ceiling. The musician Bret Michaels lends a hand. 7:15 A.M. (Sho2) THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA (2010) The histories of Shea Stadium, the Mets, Billy Joel (below) and New York City itself across four and a half decades intersect in this documentary from Paul Crowder, which focuses on Mr. Joel's concerts on July 16 and July 18, 2008 -- the last performances given in the stadium, which was torn down the next year. ''For the July 18 concert,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, Paul McCartney ''miraculously appeared, having been whisked through customs at Kennedy International Airport after a flight from London that had been allowed to land early. He was sped to the stadium by a motorcade in 11 minutes and driven onto the field in time to perform by Pete Flynn, the dedicated groundskeeper who had driven the Beatles to the same stage 43 years earlier.'' Mr. Holden added: '' 'If it weren't for the Beatles,' Mr. Joel declares, 'I wouldn't do what I do.' Call it perfect symmetry. The final number, 'Let It Be,' rings as a sweet valedictory to all the struggle, the teamwork and the glory captured in this wonderful film.'' In the film ''The Love We Make'' (2011), at 11 on Showtime, Albert Maysles, Bradley Kaplan and Ian Markiewicz capture Mr. McCartney's experiences in New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and his performance the next month with Elton John, Mr. Joel and David Bowie in the ''Concert for New York City'' at Madison Square Garden. Mr. McCartney had been on the runway at Kennedy when the attacks occurred.",

(49) TONY BENNETT: DUETS II Soon after his 85th birthday on Aug. 3, Mr. Bennett released ''Duets II,'' the follow-up to his Grammy-winning album ''Duets: An American Classic,'' made in honor of his 80th. ''Duets II'' started atop the Billboard 200 chart, making Mr. Bennett the oldest artist to reach No. 1. This ''Great Performances'' presentation captures recording sessions in Los Angeles, London, New York, Nashville and at the home of Andrea Bocelli in Italy. It also features performances including ''Body and Soul,'' with Amy Winehouse, in what would be her last recorded track; ''The Lady Is a Tramp,'' with Lady Gaga (above, with Mr. Bennett); ''Speak Low,'' with Norah Jones; ''The Way You Look Tonight,'' with Faith Hill; ''It Had to Be You,'' with Carrie Underwood; and ''On the Sunny Side of the Street,'' with Willie Nelson. ''Duets II'' has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, including for best pop duo/group. 7:15 A.M. (IFC) LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (2006) Abigail Breslin, right, received an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of the unlikely preteen princess Olive Hoover in this comedy about a family of misfits determined to get a 7-year-old to a beauty pageant. Alan Arkin won an Oscar for best supporting actor as the heroin-snorting grandfather who helps put Olive's talent routine over the top. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette play the parents driving the ravaged family and its equally dilapidated Volkswagen bus. Steve Carell portrays Olive's suicidal gay uncle, and Paul Dano is the Hoovers' teenage son, who has decided to keep his mouth shut about the situation. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the film ''a tale about genuine faith and manufactured glory that unwinds in the American Southwest, but more rightly takes place at the terminus of the American dream, where families are one bad break away from bankruptcy.''",

Mike's inspiration: Ben (Peter ten Brink), a boy with Down syndrome who dreams of becoming an astronaut. Jessy Schram plays Robynn McKinney, a fellow teacher who helps Mike buck the opposition of school administrators.

(MoreMax) GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING (2003) This feature directorial debut from Peter Webber, based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier, imagines the life of Griet (Scarlett Johansson, right), a teenage maid in the Netherlands in the 1660s who becomes the muse for Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth) and is immortalized in one of his most famous paintings. ''Ms. Johansson is photographed so that her skin is as opalescent as her earring, but the movie is opaque,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. ''It is an earnest, obvious melodrama with no soul, filled with the longing silences that come after a sigh.'' Yet, he added, the film is ''a dexterous and absorbing visual re-creation of the lighting and the look that Vermeer achieved in his work.'' The movie received Oscar nominations for art direction, set decoration, cinematography and costume design. 9:15 A.M. (HBO2) CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989) When the mistress (Anjelica Huston) of Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau, in an Oscar-nominated performance), a Manhattan ophthalmologist, threatens to go public with their affair and his unethical financial dealings, he hires his mobster brother (Jerry Orbach) to kill her in this movie from Woody Allen, who received best director and best screenplay nominations. Mr. Allen also plays Cliff Stern, a married documentarian infatuated by another woman (Mia Farrow). Sam Waterston is Judah's best friend, a rabbi; Alan Alda is a successful television producer and Cliff's brother-in-law. ''The wonder of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' is the facility with which Mr. Allen deals with so many interlocking stories of so many differing tones and voices,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The Times. ''The film cuts back and forth between parallel incidents and between present and past with the effortlessness of a hip, contemporary Aesop.''",

When last we saw the girlfriends, Katie (Sarah Parish), the doctor who helped her terminally ill married lover commit suicide in Season 1 (and then went on to have an affair with his son and then with an old, also-married flame), was about to find out if her latest beau would sweep her off to Australia in an act of forgiveness. Trudi (Sharon Small), who thought her husband had died in the terror attacks of Sept. 11 and discovered that he was in fact still alive, had gotten married to a man who also wasn't what he seemed.

Steve Martin is thrown into the mix as the architect overseeing the renovation of Jane's house, and he is not without his own charms.

(13, 49) KANGAROO MOB In the last 50 years, the population of eastern gray kangaroos around Canberra, the capital of Australia, has multiplied from a few hundred to tens of thousands. Forced to search for food beyond the city's drought-stricken hills, the hungry creatures have moved into urban territory, dining on parkland and lawns -- and dying by the thousands in run-ins with cars. That has led the government to reduce herds through extermination, prompting an emotional backlash. This ''Nature'' episode follows a gang of street-wise kangaroos to reveal how they survive in the city. Among them are Black Spot, above, at more than 6 feet tall the mob's dominant male and the father of most of the joeys in his group, and Madge, who teaches her son Sonny about survival among humans while carrying a nursing joey named Alice in her pouch.

Eventually he approaches the property's owner (Nana Patekar, above right, with Mr. Chavan) and becomes his assistant; the rich man, in turn, promises to become Venkatesh's benefactor if he will move from Goa to Mumbai and go to school. ''At first 'The Pool' suggests an inspirational fable in which a selfless older man rescues a youth from the streets,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this film by Chris Smith, adapted from a short story by Randy Russell. ''But just when you expect the film to turn into a predictable, rose-colored valentine to opportunity and hope, it goes to a deeper, more ambiguous place. Contemplating poverty from Venkatesh's perspective, it understands that his pursuit of upward mobility will require a terrifying leap of faith.'' The film was chosen as a New York Times Critics' Pick. In ''Summer Hours'' (2009), a movie from Olivier Assayas, at 1:45 p.m., Charles Berling and Juliette Binoche play Frédéric and Adrienne, siblings who must decide what to do with their mother's charming country house and cherished art collection after her death. Frédéric wants to keep everything the way it is for the enjoyment of the next generation. Adrienne and another brother (Jérémie Renier) want to sell the house and most of its contents, donating the best paintings and furnishings to the Musée d'Orsay. ''That, in a nutshell, is the dramatic arc of this extraordinary film, which, in spite of its modest scale, tactful manner and potentially dowdy subject matter, is packed nearly to bursting with rich meaning and deep implication,'' A.

He finds something to live for after his ex-wife leaves their 11-year-old daughter (Elle Fanning, right, with Mr. Dorff) in his care. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott described the movie as ''exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious.'' What happens, he added, ''is something marvelous: a film that never raises its voice (its loudest and most assertive sound is that Ferrari) or panders to your emotions, but that nonetheless has the power to refresh your perceptions and deepen your sympathies.''

Calling Mr. Beane's book ''somewhat revisionist,'' Ms. Goodman said that the biggest twist was having Cinderella ''rescue the prince by teaching him good values.'' She described the plot as blending political satire (to interest adult theater-goers) with slapstick humor and the familiar story of cruel stepsisters, a fairy godmother, and a magic pumpkin (to appeal to children and teenagers). Mr. Beane also sought inspiration from various literary adaptation of the tale.",

Writing in The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said that this martial arts drama from the Chinese director Zhang Yimou, set in A.D. 928, ''achieves a kind of operatic delirium, opening the floodgates of image and melodrama until the line between tragedy and black comedy is all but erased.'' She added: ''Since his debut in 1987 with 'Red Sorghum' Mr. Zhang has made more controlled films but never one that's more fun.

Viggo Mortensen is the hippie salesman who turns her life upside down in 1969, as the moon walk and Woodstock loom.

Lawrence Cranberg, 94, passed away on November 21, 2011 surrounded by his loving family. Cancer was the cause of death. Lawrence, a true patriot, was born on the 4th of July in 1917 in Bronx, New York, the eldest child of Fanny Rubenstein and Hyman Cranberg Polish and Russian immigrants. Lawrence married Charlotte Mount on October 31, 1953 in New Mexico at the Old Santa Fe Courthouse. A nuclear physicist, inventor and entrepreneur, Dr. Cranberg's career spanned seven decades, but the wonder and beauty of science was always on his mind. After graduating from Townsend Harris High School at age 16, he matriculated from the City College of New York, Harvard University, and The University of Pennsylvania. His career in science began in 1940 at the Signal Corps. Engineering Labs where he was a Senior Physicist. Dr. Cranberg developed systems of target detection and location-based use of infra-red radiation, a precursor technology to today's autofocus cameras. He later joined the Los Alamos National Laboratory where he became a fellow of the Atomic Energy Commission. At Los Alamos, he was a protege of Hans Bethe, and conducted groundbreaking research on high energy neutrons. Dr. Cranberg was appointed to the US delegation to the First International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy at Geneva in 1955 where he reported on his work. Among his many widely-cited publications were papers in The Scientific American and Physics Today. Dr. Cranberg also generously shared his intuitive insights with colleagues; one such insight directly led to the discovery of the neutrino. Dr. Cranberg was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1958 his nomination made by 1995 Nobelist and neutrino pioneer Frederick Reines and J.M.B. Kellogg. Once introduced as ""Mr. Nanosecond"" by Sir Denys Wilkinson to a London physics conference, Dr. Cranberg developed the means to measure a billionth of second before ""nanotechnology"" was a word; his ""time-of-flight"" method of measuring neutron spectra became the foundation for neutron spectrometry. Following a Guggenheim fellowship in 1962, Dr. Cranberg was instrumental in securing a large federal grant to the University of Virginia to build and to become founding director of its Physics Accelerator Laboratory. He was a devoted scientist and teacher. Thirty years later, one of his grateful graduate students would endow a scholarship and faculty research in his name at George Mason University, remarking that Dr. Cranberg inspired him by exemplifying the work ethic of American scientists. Dr. Cranberg didn't hesitate to fight for justice whether it be the case of his own academic freedom, or his involvement in the lawsuit that eventually forced UVA to accept women into its formerly all-male undergraduate school. In 1971, after winning an AAUP hearing that declared his academic freedom had been invaded, Dr. Cranberg moved to Austin where he joined a small high-tech company, eventually starting his own firm to develop fast-neutron techniques for the treatment of cancer. He was always grateful for the welcome arms of the private sector and of Texas, calling it ""The Land of Milk and Honey"". In 1975, Dr. Cranberg applied the laws of physics to fire-building and invented the Texas Fireframe grate. Later dubbed ""The Physicist's Fire"" by Time magazine, his invention was featured in news stories on CBS and BBC. His company is now run by his daughter. An advocate for social causes throughout his life, Dr. Cranberg fought for racial equality in Virginia (he also recruited the first black graduate physics student at UVA), for the freedom of Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov and for scientists and inventors not properly credited for their work. He wrote incisively about topics from the ethical problems of scientists to the pseudoscientific basis of Marxism. Dr. Cranberg's candidacy for the U.S. Senate from Texas was inspired by his desire for science to better inform decisions in and of the law. Dr. Cranberg's capacity for indignation at injustice was matched only by his optimistic belief in his ability to fight for change and to make a difference. Dr. Cranberg was a loving, devoted husband, father and grandfather: his last words were ""I'm the richest man in the world."" His enthusiasm, generosity, sense of humor and his quest for knowledge, truth, and justice are just a few of the qualities that his family, friends and colleagues will always remember him for. Dr. Cranberg is survived by Charlotte, wife of 58 years; son Alex of Austin, Texas; daughter Nicole and husband Giff Crosby of Cos Cob, Connecticut; and grandchildren Jacob, Hannah and Clare. Other surviving family members include brother, Gilbert Cranberg of Sarasota, Florida and sister, Sylvia Troy of Beverly Shores, Indiana.

Lawrence Cranberg, 94, passed away on November 21, 2011 surrounded by his loving family. Cancer was the cause of death. Lawrence, a true patriot, was born on the 4th of July in 1917 in Bronx, New York, the eldest child of Fanny Rubenstein and Hyman Cranberg - Polish and Russian immigrants. Lawrence married Charlotte Mount on October 31, 1953 in New Mexico at the Old Santa Fe Courthouse. A nuclear physicist, inventor and entrepreneur, Dr. Cranberg's career spanned seven decades, but the wonder and beauty of science was always on his mind. After graduating from Townsend Harris High School at age 16, he matriculated from the City College of New York, Harvard University, and The University of Pennsylvania. His career in science began in 1940 at the Signal Corps. Engineering Labs where he was a Senior Physicist. Dr. Cranberg developed systems of target detection and location-based use of infra-red radiation, a precursor technology to today's autofocus cameras. He later joined the Los Alamos National Laboratory where he became a fellow of the Atomic Energy Commission. At Los Alamos, he was a protege of Hans Bethe, and conducted groundbreaking research on high energy neutrons. Dr. Cranberg was appointed to the US delegation to the First International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy at Geneva in 1955 where he reported on his work. Among his many widely-cited publications were papers in The Scientific American and Physics Today. Dr. Cranberg also generously shared his intuitive insights with colleagues; one such insight directly led to the discovery of the neutrino. Dr. Cranberg was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1958 - his nomination made by 1995 Nobelist and neutrino pioneer Frederick Reines and J.M.B. Kellogg. Once introduced as ""Mr. Nanosecond"" by Sir Denys Wilkinson to a London physics conference, Dr. Cranberg developed the means to measure a billionth of second before ""nanotechnology"" was a word; his ""time-of-flight"" method of measuring neutron spectra became the foundation for neutron spectrometry. Following a Guggenheim fellowship in 1962, Dr. Cranberg was instrumental in securing a large federal grant to the University of Virginia to build and to become founding director of its Physics Accelerator Laboratory. He was a devoted scientist and teacher. Thirty years later, one of his grateful graduate students would endow a scholarship and faculty research in his name at George Mason University, remarking that Dr. Cranberg inspired him by exemplifying the work ethic of American scientists. Dr. Cranberg didn't hesitate to fight for justice whether it be the case of his own academic freedom, or his involvement in the lawsuit that eventually forced UVA to accept women into its formerly all-male undergraduate school. In 1971, after winning an AAUP hearing that declared his academic freedom had been invaded, Dr. Cranberg moved to Austin where he joined a small high-tech company, eventually starting his own firm to develop fast-neutron techniques for the treatment of cancer. He was always grateful for the welcome arms of the private sector and of Texas, calling it ""The Land of Milk and Honey"". In 1975, Dr. Cranberg applied the laws of physics to fire-building and invented the Texas Fireframe grate. Later dubbed ""The Physicist's Fire"" by Time magazine, his invention was featured in news stories on CBS and BBC. His company is now run by his daughter. An advocate for social causes throughout his life, Dr. Cranberg fought for racial equality in Virginia (he also recruited the first black graduate physics student at UVA), for the freedom of Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov and for scientists and inventors not properly credited for their work. He wrote incisively about topics from the ethical problems of scientists to the pseudoscientific basis of Marxism. Dr. Cranberg's candidacy for the U.S. Senate from Texas was inspired by his desire for science to better inform decisions in and of the law. Dr. Cranberg's capacity for indignation at injustice was matched only by his optimistic belief in his ability to fight for change and to make a difference. Dr. Cranberg was a loving, devoted husband, father and grandfather: his last words were ""I'm the richest man in the world."" His enthusiasm, generosity, sense of humor and his quest for knowledge, truth, and justice are just a few of the qualities that his family, friends and colleagues will always remember him for. Dr. Cranberg is survived by Charlotte, wife of 58 years; son Alex of Austin, Texas; daughter Nicole and husband Giff Crosby of Cos Cob, Connecticut; and grandchildren Jacob, Hannah and Clare. Other surviving family members include brother, Gilbert Cranberg of Sarasota, Florida and sister, Sylvia Troy of Beverly Shores, Indiana.

(Showtime) THE HELP (2011) Skeeter (Emma Stone), an aspiring writer from a prominent family in early 1960s Mississippi, causes an uproar in her community when she interviews black female servants in this adaptation of the Kathryn Stockett novel, directed and written by Tate Taylor. Viola Davis earned a best actress Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Aibileen, a maid who has raised several of the town's white babies. Octavia Spencer (above right, with Ms. Davis) won for best supporting actress as Aibileen's best friend, Minny, who endures soul-killing work for Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard), a housewife who believes in white superiority. And Cicely Tyson is Constantine, the woman who raised Skeeter -- and who inspires her former charge's journey of discovery. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called this best picture nominee a ''big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum.'' The movie's ''vision of a divided America that while consistently insulting and sometimes even terrifying, is rarely grotesque, despite Hilly's best (worst) segregationist efforts,'' she added. ''Inside all these different homes, black and white women tend to the urgent matters of everyday life, like the care and feeding of children.

She's married to a philandering former president, Bud Hammond (Ciaran Hinds), but in this make-believe version, Elaine doesn't stand by her man -- she divorces him. Carla Gugino is Susan Berg, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for writing about Bud's infidelities, and who has exclusive access to Elaine in exchange for keeping the news about the Hammonds' troubled son, T. J. (Sebastian Stan), quiet. (His twin, Douglas, played by Mr. Wolk, is Elaine's chief of staff.) And Adrian Pasdar is President Paul Garcetti, the charismatic candidate who beat Elaine for the Democratic nomination. ''It may be too soon to assess her place in history, but it is already clear that Mrs. Clinton has a huge hold on the public imagination: a woman so well known, and yet so unknowable, that writers and filmmakers keep turning to fiction to try to solve her mystery,'' Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. She added: ''Mrs. Clinton's life, with all its political triumphs and private torments, turned out to be juicier than any script a movie or television studio could conjure.

Maggie Smith is his imperious mother, and Siobhan Finneran is Miss O'Brien, Lady Grantham's Machiavellian maid. The story reopens in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme, where Matthew -- his romance with Lord Grantham's eldest daughter, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), derailed -- is now an officer trying to keep his troops alive. ''As the dowager countess, Ms. Smith has many of the best lines and usually the last word,'' Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times.

Mr. Simon had hired Mr. Price, the author of ''Clockers'' and other novels, to write for ''The Wire,'' and we thought Mr. Simon would understand the differences involved in writing a cop show for cable and one for broadcast. But when the conversation wound back to ''The Wire,'' four years after that endlessly exalted show went off the air, a controversy was born. In the interview, for ArtsBeat, we mentioned that Mr. Price had said that though many people praise ''The Wire'' now, at the time the show was broadcast it didn't draw many viewers and almost couldn't get a Season 4, much less a Season 5.",

''I'm out,'' he says at one point, intent on making the kind of human connection that his taciturn temperament and job -- as a hit man, perhaps -- have denied him until now. Soon he has made friends with a priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a prostitute (Violante Placido), who is so enamored of his prowess in bed that she stops charging him.

CBS has moved ''C.S.I.'' out of its longtime home on Thursday night to Wednesdays in the fall. Ratings for the series began to fall off sharply toward the end of last season, the show's 11th on the air. There had been some question about whether CBS would try to keep the crime drama alive, facing the challenges of having to replace a star for the second time. But CBS often retains shows longer than other networks, calculating that new shows are always a bigger risk And ''C.S.I.'' remains a significant financial asset for the company, which has an ownership stake in the series. The drama still sells to many international broadcasters and its repeats are still purchased for a high price by the cable channel Spike. Mr. Danson has expanded his acting repertoire in recent years, playing a villain on the FX series ''Damages'' -- and gaining an Emmy nomination - and a reprobate publisher on the HBO comedy ''Bored to Death.''

The director Werner Herzog combed through their footage to create this documentary, which casts an unsentimental eye on Treadwell's mission to protect the grizzlies and questions his preparation for life in the wilderness. Interviews with family members and friends shed light on Treadwell's past as an actor who struggled with addiction. And those who last saw him, including the medical examiner who performed his autopsy, depict him as a man who failed to appreciate the power and danger of nature. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that Treadwell's adventures with grizzlies amounted to ''a kind of performance, built on lies and truth and played out on the stage of celebrity.'' She added, ''Even though his choices were dangerous and finally fatal, he traveled a familiar American path shaped by boundless optimism and an almost religious belief in the self.''",

(HBO2) SEPARATE LIES (2005) In this directorial debut from Julian Fellowes (''Downton Abbey''), who adapted the screenplay from Nigel Balchin's novel ''A Way Through the Wood,'' Tom Wilkinson portrays James Manning, a London lawyer who spares no one his imperious authority, not even his wife, Anne (Emily Watson, above with Mr. Wilkinson). When the husband of their cleaning woman is killed in a hit-and-run accident, James suspects that Bill Bule (Rupert Everett), a family acquaintance who attended a party at the Mannings' home that evening, was driving the car. Then Anne confesses that she and Bill are having an affair -- and that she was behind the wheel. But instead of allowing her to go to the police, James constructs an alibi. ''This powerful performance, equal in stature to Mr. Wilkinson's grieving father in 'In the Bedroom,' pushes 'Separate Lies' halfway toward the rarefied class of that 2001 film,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times.

(CMT) PETTY BLUE Think of Nascar, and chances are the name Petty is going to come to mind. This new documentary follows the family dynasty around the track, starting with its patriarch, Lee Petty (above, center, with his sons Maurice, left, and Richard), who raced under No. 42 and was the face of Nascar's earliest days in 1949. It continues with his son Richard (No. 43), the Hall of Famer and driver with the most wins in the sport's history -- and the only motor sports athlete to earn the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- and Richard's son, Kyle (No. 44), who has twice won one of Nascar's most prominent honors, the Myers Brothers Award. It also follows the family tragedy. In 2000 Kyle's son Adam (No. 45) was killed, more than 50 years after his great-grandfather's first race, when the throttle of his car stuck while he was practicing in New Hampshire -- sending him barreling into a wall. Kevin Costner narrates this film, whose title refers to the distinctive blue color of Richard's cars in the 1960s and '70s, the most famous of which was probably the Plymouth Superbird -- the character Richard played in the 2006 animated Pixar film ''Cars.'' In ''Invitation Only,'' at 10, Toby Keith performs songs from his new album, including the title track, ''Bullets in the Gun,'' as well as ''Somewhere Else'' and his latest single, ''Trailerhood.''

Chipwich Chippoppity, a cookie candy, came out of the Chipwich brand and at its second release functioned in conjunction with MyStudentBiz, a business which allowed students to earn money, scholarships, and own a part of the company.

He graduated from Briarcliff High School in 1951, Princeton University in 1955, and received his M.A. in American Studies from Columbia University in 1993. He served in the U.S. Army from 1955-1957. His career at CBS Television spanned from 1965 to 1989, working on the acquisition, scheduling and promotion of prime-time movies in New York, then becoming the Director of ""Made for Television"" movies in Los Angeles, and starting and supervising the CBS Late Movie in New York. In 1977 he became Director of Program Development, responsible for all aspects of developing comedy and dramatic series. After retiring, Mike continued with CBS News/New York Times conducting telephone interviews with members of Congress, delegates to various presidential conventions and the general public on timely subjects of local and national interest. He worked for the U.S. Census in New York and for Robert A. Becker Inc. where he recruited medical professionals for meetings and conferences on medical subjects.

For the rider, street scenes can open up in flashes between stopped cars, creating a kind of stuttered approximation of film. No wonder, then, that many riders, like Luke Stiles and Chris Thormann, have tried to capture these scenes with a camera.

This installment begins with ''Adventure in Iraq'' (1943), in which an airplane carrying an estranged American couple (John Loder and Ruth Ford) during World War II is forced to land in the Iraqi desert, where its passengers are captured by a sect of Devil worshipers who plan to sacrifice them in exchange for three brothers about to be executed for espionage by the British. The evening continues with ''Action in Arabia'' (1944), in which an American newspaper correspondent (George Sanders) tangles with Nazis in Damascus, at 9:30; ''Sirocco'' (1951), starring Humphrey Bogart as a mysterious American who gets mixed up with gunrunners in Syria, at 11; ''Trunk to Cairo'' (1966), in which a secret agent (Audie Murphy) takes on neo-Nazis running a munitions factory in Egypt, at 1 a.m.; and ''Sinbad the Sailor'' (1947), with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (above) as the Arabian Nights hero seeking the lost treasure of Alexander the Great, at 3:30. 8 P.M.

In his report Mr. Brokaw reveals what happened to the families and asks whether the war was worth it. ''Nobody wants to go to war, nobody,'' says Staff Sgt.

Honeymooners Polly (Jean Peters) and Ray Cutler (Casey Adams) arrive at their cottage by the falls to find that Rose (Monroe) and George Loomis (Joseph Cotten, above with Monroe) have not yet checked out. The Cutlers take temporary accommodations, and the two couples' lives quickly become intertwined, making secrets harder to keep. Polly soon discovers that Rose is cheating on her husband and that his jealous rage is likely justified, although he does seem a bit unstable. And George's uneven personality is caused by Rose's openly lascivious behavior around other men, which is part of her plan. You see, Rose's lover, Patrick (Richard Allan), is to murder George, and it will appear to be the unsurprising suicide or disappearance of a temperamental man. Murder plots rarely go according to plan, however. At 1:30 is the whodunit film noir ''I Wake Up Screaming,'' (1941) starring Betty Grable, Victor Mature and Carole Landis. Frankie (Mature), a promoter, has been accused of murdering Vicky (Landis), a model and aspiring actress. Frankie and Vicky's sister, Jill (Grable), are interrogated for hours and their answers turned into flashbacks reveal the plot. A very eager cop played by Laird Cregar torments and pressures Frankie, and circumstantial evidence against the suspect starts to pile up. 7 A.M.

(TCM) THE ESSENTIALS: CLARK GABLE IN COLOR Robert Osborne and Alec Baldwin explain why this lineup is required viewing, beginning with ''The Misfits'' (1961), which stars Marilyn Monroe (below, with Clark Gable) as Roslyn Taber, a freshly divorced showgirl, and Gable as Gay Langland, a ruggedly independent cowboy intent on joining an auto mechanic (Eli Wallach) and a rodeo performer (Montgomery Clift) in a plan to rope mustangs -- known as misfits, because they're too small for riding -- in the Nevada desert and sell them for dog food. Directed by John Huston and written by Arthur Miller, the film is considered a pioneer in the evolution of the American western, with its more contemporary, bleaker outlook. ''Westerns and the West have always been built on a morally balanced world where evil has a recognizable tab -- the black hats -- and evil always loses out in the end,'' Miller wrote. ''This is that same world, but it's been dragged out of the 19th century into today, when the good guy is also part of the problem.'' Among the movie's memorable lines: Gay's declaration that ''the man who's too afraid to die is too afraid to live.'' (Gable died just weeks after completing the film.) The evening continues into the wee hours with Gable as a big-game hunter in Kenya in ''Mogambo'' (1953), at 10:15; a slave owner in ''Band of Angels'' (1957), at 12:15 a.m.; a Dutch intelligence officer in ''Betrayed'' (1954), at 2:30; and a con man who seduces widows in ''The King and Four Queens'' (1956), at 4:30.

But most of the concert takes place out of sight of the camera in this film from Ang Lee, which focuses instead on the transformative effects of that landmark event on an assortment of people. In the forefront is Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin, above), an interior decorator living in Greenwich Village, on whose memoir the film is based. Elliot returns to the Catskills to help his parents (Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton), Jews who immigrated from Russia, keep their failing motel afloat. He also paves the way for Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy), the owner of the dairy farm where the festival was held, and Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff), its primary creator, to strike a deal. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said: ''For all its sincerity, 'Taking Woodstock' lacks the passion of Mr. Lee's finest films, 'Brokeback Mountain,' 'Lust, Caution,' 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'The Ice Storm.'

Under contract to MGM, she had achieved fame by 1937 as the first back-to-back Oscar recipient in acting. ''Nothing worse could have happened to me,'' she said later of her subsequent inability to meet audience expectations in a succession of insignificant roles. After a failed marriage to the playwright Clifford Odets, she left MGM after only three and a half years and eight pictures, returning to film briefly in 1943 in ''Hostages'' for Paramount.

This seductive drama from André Téchiné was based on the real-life case involving Marie-Léonie Leblanc, a 23-year-old who claimed in 2004 that she had been the victim of an anti-Semitic attack by six men of North African and African origin on a train outside Paris. The French president at the time, Jacques Chirac, condemned the attack, and the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, urged French Jews to leave for Israel to ''escape the wildest anti-Semitism.''

Rickey, ''a white man, is rarely mentioned when the great civil rights leaders are discussed. His politics were small-town Republican, his judgments often puritanical. He had numerous reasons for integrating baseball, Breslin reminds us, not all of them noble. But without his vision and persistence, civil rights may have taken an even slower, rougher path.''",

Critics praised his songs and clever updating of the classic fairy tales ""Pinocchio, ""Jack and The Beanstalk,"" ""Emperor's New Clothes"" and ""Aladdin,"" calling them ""Sparkling and humorous"", noting, ""adults enjoyed them as much, or more, than the children."" Born in Granite City, Illinois, Mr. Eiler's early career included the Nat. Companies of ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,"" and ""Kismet"" (Omar Khayyam). He appeared in major stock productions playing comedy leads. His favorite was Og, the leprechaun, in ""Finian's Rainbow."" Performing aboard ship on a lengthy world tour, there was constant need for new material which he could quickly supply. On his return to NY this talent led to writing ""special material"" for many stars, and eventually to the founding of the Prince Street Players. He will be remembered by the many actors and directors who got their first break performing in a Prince Street show. All eleven of his scripts and scores are now leased throughout the world by Music Theatre International. His legacy is a joyous one of shared love and laughter through his words and music.<br><br>",

What began as one man's journey to raise money and awareness for cancer research has grown into the world's largest one-day fund-raiser for the cause. Though Mr. Fox, who was born in 1958, ran the equivalent of a marathon each day, he never finished his quest: starting in Newfoundland, he made it to Ontario before the cancer spread to his lungs. He died in 1981. In this latest entry in ESPN's ''30 for 30'' documentary series, the first-time filmmaker Steve Nash, a Canadian and a point guard for the Phoenix Suns, and the director Ezra Holland recount the story of Mr. Fox, one of Mr. Nash's childhood idols. ''I remember being a 6-year-old boy and waking up every morning and rushing to the TV to see where Terry was that day,'' Mr. Nash said. ''To see him running or hobbling across our country for the spirit of community and looking out for others was something that has stuck with me ever since. To see his face hiding the pain and to hear his words disguising the sacrifice was as motivating and as educational an experience as I've ever had.'' 8 P.M.

Her play ''HARVEY,'' about a man and his tall, invisible rabbit friend, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1944 and ran in its original Broadway production for more than four years. Now Roundabout Theater Company is reviving Chase's comedy in the first Broadway production of the 2012-13 season. When a show opens amid the feverish fuss about Tony Awards for the prior season, as ''Harvey'' is doing, its performances are often forgotten a year later. But the Roundabout has assembled a cast as likely to be memorable as any, led by Jim Parsons, the two-time Emmy Award winner for his portrayal of Sheldon Cooper, the charming nerd of a theoretical physicist on the CBS comedy ''The Big Bang Theory.'' He plays the rabbit-friendly Elwood P. Dowd, a role memorably played by James Stewart in the 1950 film version and the 1970 Broadway revival. Scott Ellis directs a cast that also includes Jessica Hecht, Charles Kimbrough, Larry Bryggman and Carol Kane.

That feel-good film franchise was dropped by CBS in May after a 16-year partnership, only to be picked up in July by ABC. But it seems that its audience forgot to change the channel. On Sunday ABC showed its first Hallmark movie, ''Mitch Albom's Have a Little Faith,'' which lost more than 50 percent of the total audience from last year's post-Thanksgiving Sunday presentation of ''November Christmas.'' That movie drew 13.5 million total viewers for CBS while ''Have a Little Faith'' managed only 6.5 million for ABC.

Some new material, known as intake forms, collected by the center's sexual assault response team were discovered this week. The discovery comes after last year's revelation that the center had 3,000 videotapes of medical exams of children who were alleged victims of assault. The videotapes have already led to the release of a man  convicted earlier and have put other convictions at risk. An appellate court ruled two years ago that hospital examiners were part of the ""prosecution team"" and that the district attorney's office was responsible for making sure evidence was turned over to defendants.

The ruling has resulted in a number of marijuana cases being dismissed; other trials ended in acquittals. Law enforcement agencies around the state are struggling with the aftermath of the ruling. ""Gray is not a good color for the law,"" said Gerald Benito, the Shasta County district attorney, who dismissed a case this month. ""It makes it very difficult for us to enforce the law - I think everyone is crying out for a clear line."" [The Associated Press]",2010/03/29

Goldman conducted it on Friday, March 25, the day before Couric took off for a pre-big-news vacation to Turks and Caicos.

How well? According to Nielsen ratings data from Sept. 19 through Oct. 9, CBS has 20 of the top 30 shows among the broadcast networks in total viewership, making CBS the first network to accomplish such a feat. It was also the number one network in average viewership and in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic. Stalwarts ""NCIS"" and ""NCIS: LA"" certainly helped the network's cause on Tuesday, garnering 18.7 million viewers and 15.4 million respectively, although the two dramas hit season lows in the 18-to-49 demo. If it can hold steady, ABC will have a new entry in the top 30 with the new Tim Allen comedy ""Last Man Standing.""

Pro Bowl drew a decent number of fans on Sunday as the American Football Conference defeated the National Football Conference 59-41, though not nearly enough to dominate the overall broadcast network ratings.

Those two networks were close enough in total viewers that NBC might yet squeak by when the final numbers are released. ""Undercover Boss"" had the largest audience for CBS, at 13.1 million total viewers. On ABC, ""Once Upon a Time"" continued to perform well - especially for a freshman drama - with its highest audience total since November (10.8 million).",2012/01/30

The format is similar to CBS's long-running summer series ''Big Brother,'' and ABC has hired many former production members from that show. On Friday CBS sent a sternly worded letter to ABC about it. The letter implies, without directly saying so, that CBS will sue ABC over copyright infringement. The letter said that CBS was ''putting ABC on notice that its continued development and production of 'Glass House' exposes ABC to liability.'' The letter said the elements of the new show are ''substantially and strikingly'' similar to ''Big Brother.'' In ''Glass House,'' which has its debut on June 18, 14 people are chosen to live in a house all summer with cameras on them in pursuit of a cash prize -- the essence of ''Big Brother'' competition. In the past copyright cases have proved nearly impossible for reality-show plaintiffs to win because, in simple terms, everybody's reality is inherently different. The total number of former staff members on ''Glass House'' is at least 18, according to the CBS letter, all of whom signed nondisclosure agreements when they worked for ''Big Brother.'' The CBS letter argued that it would be impossible for anyone who signed such a letter to help produce a similar show without breaching the agreement. ABC had yet to respond to the CBS letter or requests for comment by Sunday afternoon.",2012/05/07
