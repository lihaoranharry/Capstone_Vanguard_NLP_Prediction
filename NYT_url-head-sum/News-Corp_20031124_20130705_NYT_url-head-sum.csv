There is plenty enough spectacle without speculation. Nor is this the place to celebrate a rival's troubles. True, I did pull from my files and savor the indignant letters we received from News of the World's top editors last year as we prepared to publish an investigation of the paper's phone-hacking culture and Scotland Yard's timidity -- work that has been fully vindicated in recent weeks. But even if it is true, as online wags put it, that Murdoch's troubles threaten to deplete the world supply of schadenfreude, I don't plan to join the party.",

The glamorous favorite of the tyrant has fallen from her high perch, and it is rumored that further depths of corruption are waiting to be plumbed. Reputations everywhere are in tatters. Such was the view on Saturday night - no, not of the television screen from my couch - but from a seat at the Donmar Warehouse toward the end of its production of ''Luise Miller.''

Well, consider the following. A recent study found that 10 percent of people who work on Wall Street are ''clinical psychopaths,'' exhibiting a lack of interest in and empathy for others and an ''unparalleled capacity for lying, fabrication, and manipulation.'' (The proportion at large is 1 percent.) Another study concluded that the rich are more likely to lie, cheat and break the law. The only thing that puzzles me about these claims is that anyone would find them surprising. Wall Street is capitalism in its purest form, and capitalism is predicated on bad behavior. This should hardly be news. The English writer Bernard Mandeville asserted nearly as much three centuries ago in a satirical-poem-cum-philosophical-treatise called ''The Fable of the Bees.''",

Is a death mask found in a ragpicker's shop in 1842 that of William Shakespeare? This coming Saturday's issue of the British weekly New Scientist says the mask, left, bearing the date 1616 and the high forehead, prominent nose and beard associated with Shakespeare, could be, Agence France-Presse reported. At the behest of Prof. Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel, a scholar of English literature at the University of Mainz in Germany, specialists at the German Federal Bureau of Investigation compared two portraits widely believed to be of Shakespeare with a bust in the Garrick Club in London and concluded that all the faces belonged to the same person. Then engineers at Konica Minolta Europe scanned the bust and the death mask with lasers to construct three-dimensional computer models. ''Superimposing the models revealed perfect matches between the forehead, eyes and nose,'' New Scientist reports. But the lips on the death mask, owned by the city of Darmstadt, Germany, were thinner than those on the bust. The professor said the lips would have shrunk because of loss of blood pressure after death. New Scientist says British experts remain unconvinced, and art historians suspect that the Garrick Club bust was made more than 140 years after Shakespeare died in 1616. News Corp. Creates New TV Network News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, right, yesterday announced plans to begin My Network TV, stepping into a void created when CBS and Warner Brothers Entertainment formed the youth-oriented network CW last month out of the most popular programs on the struggling UPN and WB. The new mini-network will supply prime-time material for 10 local stations left without programming when UPN said it would close, The Associated Press reported. The heart of the new lineup will be ''Desire'' and ''Secrets,'' two six-day-a-week serials with 13-week story lines, like the successful telenovelas on Spanish-language networks like Univision. My Network, led by Roger Ailes, who built Fox News into the leading all-news cable channel, will begin operations on Sept. 5 in major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. A First Musical The Atlantic Theater Company will present the first musical in its history this spring when it opens the final production of its 20th-anniversary season, the world premiere of ''Spring Awakening.'' With music by Duncan Sheik, below, book and lyrics by Steven Sater and direction by Michael Mayer (''Thoroughly Modern Millie''), the show is based on the controversial Frank Wedekind drama ''The Awakening of Spring.'' Written in 1891 and dealing with the onset of puberty in children, the play was not produced until 1906 and was banned in Britain until 1963. With a cast of 14 and choreography by Bill T. Jones, ''Spring Awakening,'' which follows a dozen young people through their sexual awakening, is to begin previews on May 18, open officially on June 15 and run through July 9.

Ireland Honors Friel In ceremonies yesterday in Dublin, Brian Friel, the author of plays including ''Philadelphia, Here I Come!'' and ''Dancing at Lughnasa,'' was awarded the Irish government's highest honor in the arts, becoming one of the five elder statesman of Aosdana, the state-financed artists' academy, when President Mary McAleese placed a ceremonial gold Celtic band around his neck. Mr. Friel, whose ''Faith Healer'' begins previews in April on Broadway, was first elected to Aosdana, the affiliation of creative artists, in 1982. This year, the organization elected 12 new members, bringing its number to 220 and including its first architect, Shelley McNamara, and first musician, Donal Lunny. 'Lost' and Found Seen briefly on the ABC hit series ''Lost,'' a surreal comic novel by an Irish author who died 40 years ago has been rescued from obscurity, Reuters reported. The novel, ''The Third Policeman,'' was written by Flann O'Brien (1911-66), who was influenced by James Joyce, and fans of ''Lost'' are apparently scouring it for clues to the mysterious island where passengers from a downed airliner are marooned. Craig Wright, a supervising producer and scriptwriter for ''Lost,'' said the book, seen on an episode first broadcast in the United States in October, was chosen ''very specifically for a reason.'' Within two days of the broadcast, 10,000 copies were sold. ''It's been amazing,'' said Chad Post, associate director of the Center for Book Culture at Illinois State University in Normal, publisher of O'Brien's books in the United States. ''In three weeks, we sold 15,000 copies, the same number as we'd sold in the last six years.'' Even in Britain, where the episode has yet to be broadcast, requests for the books are being received by HarperCollins, the British publisher. It describes the novel as ''a thriller, an hilarious comic satire about an archetypal village police force, a surrealistic vision of eternity, the story of a tender, brief, unrequited love affair between a man and his bicycle and a chilling fable of unending guilt.'' Footnotes Cherry Jones, who won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Sister Aloysius, will recreate the role for the first six months of a 24-city national tour of John Patrick Shanley's Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, ''Doubt.''

Last year News Corporation abandoned a $12 billion bid to assume full control of BSkyB when its British newspaper subsidiary, News International, a separate company, became mired in the phone hacking scandal that continues to spread through Mr. Murdoch's empire, while also enmeshing some of Britain's top politicians and law-enforcement officials.",2012/05/03
