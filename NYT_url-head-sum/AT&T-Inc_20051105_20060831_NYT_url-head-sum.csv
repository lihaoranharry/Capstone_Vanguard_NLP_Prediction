Stein was charged Thursday with accepting kickbacks and bribes as a comptroller and financial officer for the American occupation authority in Iraq. The public defender's office representing him would not comment on the case. An American contractor, Philip H. Bloom, was also charged. Behind the News -- This case can only hurt the Bush administration's reputation. For one, Mr. Stein was hired despite having served a prison term for felony fraud in the 1990's. For another, the case against Mr. Stein and Mr. Bloom have emerged from a sweeping investigation of rebuilding contracts by a task force led by Stuart W. Bowen Jr., the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction. Expect more arrests. A PEER OF THE REALM The News -- A federal grand jury indicted Conrad M. Black, former Canadian media baron and current British lord, on fraud charges. Lord Black and three colleagues are accused of a scheme to defraud the giant newspaper publisher Hollinger International of nearly $52 million. Lord Black, who helped create Hollinger and was chief executive until the board dismissed him two years ago, denies the charges. Behind the News -- Lord Black joins the former heads of Enron, Adelphia, WorldCom and Tyco in a string of cases against chief executives accused of betraying investors. This indictment comes as he was trying for a comeback. His lawyer, Edward Greenspan, issued a statement saying, ''Conrad Black asserts his innocence without qualification.'' A RAP PRODUCER The News -- The hip-hop record producer Irv Gotti and his brother went on trial in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Wednesday on money-laundering charges. Behind the News -- Prosecutors say that the drug lord Kenneth McGriff helped finance Mr. Gotti's record label, Murder Inc., and funneled tainted money into the business. Mr. Gotti's lawyers say Mr. McGriff did no more than help the impresarios obtain the street cachet they needed to succeed. One of Murder Inc.'s top artists, Ja Rule, called the case ''a war against hip-hop.'' A MUSEUM CURATOR The News -- The trial of Marion True, former antiquities curator for the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, opened in Rome on Wednesday. Mrs. True and Robert E. Hecht, an American dealer, are charged with conspiring to import illegally excavated antiquities. Behind the News -- The trial is one of several woes for the Getty, but Italian authorities hope to make the case a bellwether for similar claims against other museums. ''The age of trafficking in art pieces is over,'' the Italian culture minister, Rocco Buttiglione, said. ''This isn't about seeking revenge for the past. It's about reclaiming property rights for Italy.'' The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre, and the Hermitage, among others, are taking notes. A TOP COP The News -- New Jersey officials said that Bernard B. Kerik, while New York City correction commissioner in the late 1990's, accepted tens of thousands of dollars from a construction company with ties to organized crime, which he was helping to pursue business with the city. A lawyer for Mr. Kerik has said his client was unaware that anyone else had paid for the work. Behind the News -- The big question is whether Mr. Kerik's problems, and his abrupt withdrawal last year as the nominee for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, will affect the political future of Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani, who is considering a presidential run in 2008, has been a friend, supporter and, until recently, employer of Mr. Kerik's.",

Refco, based in New York, was the largest independent futures and commodities brokerage in the nation before the scandal prompted customers to abandon the firm, forcing it to file for bankruptcy last month. No trial date was set but Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of United States District Court in Manhattan set another hearing for Jan. 18.

(AP) AnnTaylor Doubles Profit in Third Quarter The women's clothing retailer AnnTaylor Stores Corporation said yesterday that third-quarter profit more than doubled, the biggest gain in three years, after it sold more pants and sweaters at full price and cut marketing costs. Third-quarter net income climbed to $30.4 million, or 42 cents a share, from $13.9 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period ended Oct. 29 climbed 12 percent, to $514 million, AnnTaylor said. An improved fashion assortment at the Ann Taylor chain, including dresses in black and ivory, helped limit discounts. AnnTaylor is renovating stores, trimming inventory and adding apparel in neutral colors to increase comparable-store sales, which rose in two of the past three months after nine consecutive declines. Comparable-store sales at the Ann Taylor division rose 3.7 percent, compared with a 4.2 percent drop last year.

G.M. says it had a 12.5 percent share in the China vehicle market, up from 10.8 percent a year earlier, making it the No. 1 foreign automaker in the country.

He was also tentatively awarded $2 million that the company included in his total compensation but will get it only if Merrill hits a profit target over the next three years. Mr. Cayne received $200,000 in salary, a $12.7 million bonus, $10.3 million of restricted stock, and $5.2 million of other compensation. Among other chief executives, Henry M.

(REUTERS) Havas Names Media Buying Executive as Chief Havas, the French advertising company led by Vincent Bolloré, named a new chief executive yesterday and halved its 2005 dividend after net profit missed analysts' expectations. Havas said the board named Fernando Rodés, the head of its media buying arm, to succeed Philippe Wahl as chief executive. Mr. Rodés' appointment, which was expected, is the latest management shake-up since Mr. Bolloré became chairman last year after amassing about 25 percent of the company. Havas said net profit rose to 59 million euros ($70 million) in 2005, from 55 million euros in 2004.

Boston Scientific's chief technical officer will join two Guidant executives to run the unit after Boston Scientific completes its $27 billion purchase of Guidant next month, the company said. R. Frederick McCoy Jr., who led the Guidant operation since 2000, will retire March 17, Guidant said separately. The new team includes Mark Bartell, now president of United States sales operations for Guidant, and the chief information officer, William McConnell.

Parts Supplier, Reports a Subpoena The auto parts supplier Lear Corporation has received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking information about General Motors's accounting for supplier payments and credits. Lear, which is based in Southfield, Mich., disclosed the subpoena in its annual report, which was filed late Thursday with the S.E.C. Lear said it received the subpoena last month and was cooperating. Lear said the S.E.C. was seeking documents related to payments or credits to G.M. from 2001 to the present. Lear supplies electronics, seats, floors and other products to every major automaker and reported sales of $17.1 billion last year. The filing came the day after Lear said it was widening its 2005 loss by $6 million because of a pricing dispute with an unnamed customer. (AP) Lawmakers Urge Rejection of Wal-Mart Bank Application Lawmakers urged regulators to reject a plan by Wal-Mart Stores to open an industrial bank, saying it will drive community banks out of business. In a March 8 letter to Martin J. Gruenberg, the acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, more than 30 members of Congress said Wal-Mart's bank could dominate lending and hurt small businesses. The representatives also said they doubted Wal-Mart would abide by federal banking rules. The letter was signed by representatives including Stephanie Tubbs Jones and Dennis Kucinich, Democrats from Ohio. Wal-Mart applied in July to open an industrial bank in Utah to process more than 1.6 million debit, credit and electronic-check transactions rather than pay third parties to handle them. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) Two Carriers Suspend Sales of Motorola's Cellphone Cingular Wireless and T-Mobile USA temporarily stopped selling Motorola's popular Razr phones this week because of a defect in some of them that causes calls to disconnect. Motorola said yesterday the flaw affected only a limited number of phones and it did not expect any impact on financial results. ''Motorola continues to ship new Razr handsets in volume to customer distribution centers and retail availability is expected to be normal across all markets by next week,'' a spokeswoman, Jennifer Weyrauch, said. Cingular Wireless and T-Mobile suspended Razr sales over the previous two days as a precaution so its customers did not receive defective phones. (AP) Freddie Mac Delays Release of Financial Report Freddie Mac said that it had delayed the release of 2005 financial data until May, disappointing analysts who had expected the company to complete a three-year accounting overhaul this month. The company said last year that it would deliver its 2005 earnings report by the end of March, and then initiate the registration of its common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In November, the company delayed its third-quarter results after it found $220 million in mistakes in first-half earnings. Freddie Mac has not provided quarterly financial reports since restating its profit higher by $5 billion in 2003. The company is overhauling its financial-reporting systems after an inquiry found officers had been manipulating accounting to make earnings less volatile. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) European Union and the United States Sign Wine Pact The European Union and the United States signed a wine deal yesterday that allows the United States to export wines made using practices many European vintners shun. Americans will now be able to sell woodchip-aged wines throughout Europe, a move some European winemakers fear will undermine their traditions. While European winemakers use oak barrels that endow distinctive flavors, American winemakers can use cheaper options to get the same effect by adding woodchips to wine fermented in metal vats. (AP) F.C.C. to Propose Educational Programs for Digital TV The Federal Communications Commission said yesterday that it planned to propose rules requiring three hours a week of educational programs on digital TV broadcasts. The proposals, to be issued March 17, also would limit broadcasters' ability to use cartoon characters like SpongeBob Squarepants to sell products on the Internet during TV shows. The rules would not apply to cable or satellite programs. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)",

The New York University mourns the loss of its great and beloved friend, Bob Tisch. Cochairman of the Loews Corporation, he was admired as a business leader for his integrity, instincts and business acumen. A native New Yorker smitten with his hometown, he had an extensive and distinguished history of philanthropy and service to New York and to his country: he served as chair of the Convention and Visitors Bureau for nearly two decades, as chair of the Citizens' Committee for the Democratic National Conventions in 1976 and 1980, as the city's Ambassador to Washington from 1990 to 1993, as a long-time member and one-time chair of the New York City Partnership, as the founding director of Citymeals-on-Wheels, and as co-founder and chair of Take the Field, a program to rebuild athletic facilities at New York's public schools. Bob's distinguished record of public service also included a two-year term as United States Postmaster General from 1986-1988. Our University was also a major beneficiary of his wisdom, time, energy, and generosity: he has served on NYU's Board of Trustees since 1982 and was responsible for signature gifts for some of our most prominent and dynamic programs, including NYU's renowned Tisch School of the Arts, Tisch Hospital and the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism, and Sports Management. In the mid 1980's Bob led a successful effort to raise more than $20 million to help launch the Tisch School's rise to prominence. Indeed, the University's successes over the past 25 years would not have been possible without the faith that Bob Tisch and the entire Tisch family had in our institution and our vision, which he devotedly help to shape. Our deepest sympathies go out to his wife Joan, children Steve, Laurie and Jonathan, and to the entire Tisch family, who should know that his name will have a special place of honor in our history, our memory, and our hearts.

The Board of Directors, officers and employees of Loews Corporation deeply mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague Bob Tisch, the cofounder and Chairman of the Board of Loews. His wisdom, intellectual honesty and integrity were an inspiration to us all. Bob Tisch was one of the country's most respected business entrepreneurs, and one of the greatest civic leaders of the city that he loved-New York. He also made his mark in the sports world as co-owner of one of the premier franchises in American sport--the New York Giants football team, and as a valued contributor to the NFL. Bob Tisch, with his late brother Larry, built Loews Corporation into one of the largest diversified financial corporations in the United States. In addition to his many years of service to Loews, Bob had a remarkable career in public service. He had the unique ability to solve problems and build partnerships, not only for the Company, but also for the city and the nation. As Postmaster General of the United States from 1986 to 1988, he was credited with restoring confidence in the integrity of the postal service. Bob Tisch played a major role in New York's business and civic life, chairing countless organizations devoted to improving life for all New Yorkers. Perhaps his greatest legacy is the indelible impact he made on society through his philanthropic leadership that touched people across the country. Bob Tisch had an extraordinary generosity of spirit. He always made time for employees and co-workers, and also for the countless people who requested his help. He never forgot a promise. Bob will be remembered as a dedicated public servant, a great philanthropist, and a corporate leader who made every employee feel that they were part of the family. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Joan; his daughter, Laurie; and his sons, Jonathan and Steve; his nine grandchildren, as well as to the entire Tisch family. $(6$)TISCH--Preston Robert. The Board and staff of Citymealson-Wheels are heartbroken by the loss of Bob Tisch, our beloved founding Board member, long-time president, and uncommonly generous friend. He led this organization with humor, affection, charm and astute business skills for two decades. Bob's warmth and compassion made all of us at Citymeals feel like cherished members of his team. His dedication to our mission was contagious and brought us support from powerful New Yorkers who respected his judgment. There was no one he couldn't reach. With a single phone call, he opened doors for Citymeals across the country --universally, people were delighted to hear his voice at the other end of the phone. Bob frequently went on meal deliveries to visit the frail elderly homebound New Yorkers, those Citymeals supports through its lifeline of food and friendly visitors. He never failed to be deeply touched by these experiences because in his heart, as he often said, he knew that these invisible neighbors, now alone and isolated, were the very people who helped build the city he loved. Bob's instinctive embrace of Citymeals in its earliest years gave us instant credibility. During his time as president Citymeals - on Wheels flourished. The number of meals we deliver and serve increased from 20,000 to 2.3 million annually. Bob's death is deeply painful for every member of our Citymeals family. To those of us who were closest, he was a source of eclectic information and pointed memories, an amused and bemused Uncle who just happened to be a legend. We are grateful for the chance to have known him and we will never forget this inspiring man who gave so much to so many. Bob Tisch will forever be remembered as our own New York Giant.

But this was not just an Andy Bronfman journey, for it also swept up all those who knew her. We were all part of her journey, all part of her passion for life, all part of her ecstatic desire to change the world. Her passion overcame the most formidable obstacles and we all came to believe that our future and and the future of the State of Israel would be secure as long as she stood at the helm with Charles. On our journey in life we are happy to have found the path that Andy had created and it was our privilege to follow her as she lit the way. Condolences to the family.

The word ''organic,'' however, was in vogue, and our customers always asked the same question: Are you organic? Nine years old and barefoot, I tried not to appear flummoxed. I stumbled over answers, most of them beginning, ''No, but'' These replies failed to satisfy. People wanted to know in a phrase whether our food was clean and safe. I'm still grateful to the customer who said, ''Explain how you do farm.'' Soon our signs read ''No Pesticides'' or ''Our Chickens Run Free on Grass.''",

A breeze picks up on the streets of Paris, scattering leaves and newspapers and blowing a man's bowler hat down a boulevard in a mighty gust.

As a result, the agency plans to build more ''flexibility and unpredictability'' into the screening process, he said, and cited the success of a recent test program at 10 airports in which random secondary screenings of passengers were conducted ''regardless of whether a passenger cleared the walk-through metal detector or a carry-on bag successfully passed through the X-ray machine.'' The agency is also developing a plan, based on another test project, to train screeners to recognize patterns of behavior, he said. ''If a passenger was identified as exhibiting behaviors indicative of fear, stress and/or deception, they were either referred for additional screening or referred for selectee screening and an evaluation interview with a law enforcement officer.'' ON THE OTHER HAND -- The Transportation Security Administration ''has achieved significant accomplishments'' in passenger and baggage screening, acknowledges Cathleen A. Berrick, a director of homeland security issues at the Government Accountability Office. But, she recently told the Senate Commerce Committee, the agency ''may have difficulty maintaining a screening work force that possesses the critical skills needed to perform at a desired level.'' Given the agency's mix of full-time and part-time employees, ''it is critical that the T. S. A. carefully consider how it strategically hires, deploys and trains'' its screeners, she said. AIRLINE CHECK-IN AT HILTON -- Printing an airline boarding pass on your laptop at the hotel the day before your departure is often a chore requiring a visit to the business center -- when it is open. Now, guests at 37 Hilton Hotels in the United States and Canada can check in and print boarding passes for 18 major airlines -- using those airlines' Web sites -- at lobby kiosks already used for hotel check-in and check-out. There is no charge for the service. REGIONAL JETS SURGE -- Major airlines are using more regional jets these days, and March passenger operations data from Republic Airways underscore the trend. Republic's revenue passenger miles -- one paying passenger flown one mile -- were up 45.3 percent for the month compared with March 2005. Capacity was up 38 percent, and total passengers rose 32.1 percent. Republic operates regional jets for airline partners like American Connection, Delta Connection, United Express and US Air Express. It has about 850 flights daily to 81 cities. PHOENIX AIRPORT IMPROVEMENTS -- Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport won federal approval on Friday for several improvement projects, including a new 33-gate West Terminal to accommodate an increase in international flights. Passenger traffic at the airport grew to 39.5 million in 2004 from 6.9 million in 1980. EMBRAER AND BUSINESS JETS -- Reflecting a new emphasis on its business jet lines, Embraer of Brazil says it expects to deliver 25 to 30 Legacy jets this year, compared with 14 in 2005. The Legacy is a $23.6 million 16-passenger executive jet. Embraer is also developing a new line of so-called very light jets, the Phenom 100 and the slightly larger Phenom 300, with initial deliveries next year. For its main commercial regional jet aircraft, Embraer said that 17 of its 27 regional jet deliveries in the first quarter of this year were its new models in the 70- to 110-seat niche, larger and more spacious than conventional regional jets.

Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'RING OF FIRE' The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who re-tailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka) 'GREY GARDENS' As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'GUARDIANS' Peter Morris's play juxtaposes the moral decline of two disparate characters caught up in the destructive tailwinds of the American invasion of Iraq: a cold-blooded tabloid journalist in London and a soldier in the United States Army. Lee Pace and Katherine Moennig give persuasive performances as the sleazy hack and the scapegoated grunt, but Mr. Morris's play is more flashily provocative than truly thoughtful (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Isherwood) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) 'MACRUNE'S GUEVARA' The Young Mirror arm of Mirror Repertory revives John Spurling's odd 1969 play about an artist who left behind a wall full of drawings of Che Guevara and the man who saw something profound in them. Parts of the play read today like a funny sendup of art critics who see too much brilliance in outsider-art gibberish; other parts seem a bit like gibberish of their own (2:15). St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A SAFE HARBOR FOR ELIZABETH BISHOP' The life of a great poet becomes the stuff of stale prose in this one-woman bio-play by Marta Góes, starring Amy Irving (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SHOW PEOPLE' Paul Weitz's eyebrow-pencil-thin comedy about a man who hires actors to impersonate his family feels like one long, occasionally amusing party game whose players don't know when to call it a night. The excellent four-member cast, led by Debra Monk and directed by Peter Askin, finds charm and energy amid the vaporous bait-and-switch plot reversals (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) 'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'CHAMPION' and 'THE STUTTERING PREACHER' Two new one-act plays, one a well-drawn family drama and the other a brash and ribald romantic comedy, from the New Federal Theater and Black Spectrum Theater. Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200. (Hunka) 'LITTLE WILLY' A slickly produced and paper-thin character study of Hitler's nephew, who moved to Long Island before World War II (1:05). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) 'SCREWMACHINE/EYECANDY OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE BIG BOB' David Calvitto is fun and scary as a television game-show host who turns sadistic, and Nancy Walsh and Bill Coelius are suitably airheaded as his contestants, but the play, by C. J. Hopkins, feels like a familiar comic skit that takes aim at an easy target (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'FAHRENHEIT 451' A visceral version of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel, staged by the Godlight Theater Company. No, firefighters don't burn books these days, but still you end up saying, ''Dang, that man had vision'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'MEN OF CLAY' In a play that Jeff Cohen, the author, says is based on his father, four Jewish men gather to play tennis in early-1970's Baltimore and watch their way of life disappear. The play seems to want to generate nostalgia, but since these four are racist, sexist pigs, it's hard to wish them anything but ill (2:15). June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 268-4444; closing Sunday.(Genzlinger) 'ON THE LINE' In a theater culture that is more likely to produce a play set in a well-heeled living room than on a factory floor, Joe Roland's unflinching portrait of a strike in New Jersey is a refreshing anomaly (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Zinoman) 'THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE MASTER RACE' Bertolt Brecht's middle-period classic in a robust new translation by Binyamin Shalom and a spare and powerful production by the Roust Theater Company, directed by James Phillip Gates (2:45). Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, SoHo, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Hunka) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ATL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by clichés and predictability. Tip Harris -- the rapper T. I. -- is intriguing as a young man who takes on the responsibility of raising his younger brother when their parents are killed, and Antwan Andre Patton -- Big Boi from OutKast -- makes a terrific drug lord. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BASIC INSTINCT 2' (R, 120 minutes) A joyless calculation, starring Sharon Stone and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, that is also a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. (Manohla Dargis) * 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (A. O. Scott) * 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens) 'DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON' (PG-13, 110 minutes) The romantic cliché that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about Daniel Johnston, a mentally ill songwriter whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living. Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs. (Stevens) * 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration on ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Stephen Holden) * 'DRAWING RESTRAINT 9' (No rating, 135 minutes) Most of this stately film of few words, conceived and directed by the artist Matthew Barney, who stars with his wife, Bjork, takes place on a Japanese whaling ship afloat in Nagasaki Bay. Steeped not only in Japanese seafaring lore but also in centuries-old traditions of Japanese ritual, the film could be described as Mr. Barney's ''Moby-Dick.'' (Holden) 'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis) * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis) 'KINKY BOOTS' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In this silly, quasi-inspirational British comedy, a staid shoe factory in Northern England avoids ruin by switching from the manufacture of men's dress shoes to that of thigh-high, stiletto-heeled boots worn by drag queens. The recipe for this feel-good movie, which cries out to be made into a musical, comes from the same cookbook that gave us ''The Full Monty.'' (Holden) 'LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO' (R, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Zoë (Bárbara Mori) is a gorgeous, vapid wife who longs for children, but her distant spouse (Christian Meier) makes love only on Saturdays. Enter the rebellious brother-in-law (Manolo Cardona), a smoldering artist whose schedule is less regimented. Bubbling with incest, adultery, religion and homosexuality, ''La Mujer de Mi Hermano'' is an overheated telenovela that considers procreation more important than honesty, and what we want more important than who we are. (Catsoulis) * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis) 'LOOK BOTH WAYS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Written and directed by the Australian animator Sarah Watt, ''Look Both Ways'' follows a group of disparate and desperate characters over the course of one of the most depressing weekends in movie history. The principal sufferers are Meryl (Justine Clarke), a morbid illustrator, and Nick (William McInnes), a terminally ill photographer, who discover that a mutual fixation on catastrophe can be quite the aphrodisiac. Bogged down by stylistic gimmickry, ''Look Both Ways'' aims for existential drama but succeeds only in reminding us that misery loves company. (Catsoulis) 'LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN' (R, 110 minutes) This star-studded jigsaw puzzle of revenge and mistaken identity thinks that it's terribly smart, although it amounts to an empty, self-satisfied imitation of ''Pulp Fiction'' that reputable actors like Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley can't salvage. (Holden) * 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis) 'ON A CLEAR DAY' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Set in and around the dockyards of Glasgow, ''On a Clear Day'' follows Frank (the great Peter Mullan), a laid-off shipbuilder who decides to fix his life by swimming the English Channel. Despite a familiar crop of lovable eccentrics and a predictably inspirational thrust, the movie balances the sentimentality with excellent performances and a healthy dose of working-class vulnerability.(Catsoulis) 'SCARY MOVIE 4' (PG-13, 83 minutes) This parasitic franchise is back to feed on last year's disposable distractions, proving, if nothing else, that there's a laugh or two left in ''Brokeback Mountain'' parodies and Viagra overdoses. (Nathan Lee) 'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Lee) 'SISTERS IN LAW' (No rating, 106 minutes, in English and pidgin) Grass-roots feminism thrives in a Cameroon village, thanks to the pair of warmhearted, tough-minded women of law profiled in this excellent verité documentary. (Lee) * 'SLITHER' (R, 96 minutes) A horror film about an extraterrestrial monster with a hunger for flesh that slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation. The writer and director James Gunn knows his icky, scary stuff. (Dargis) 'TAKE THE LEAD' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Hip-hop and ballroom dancing styles fuse in a South Bronx high school at which a dance teacher, Antonio Banderas, turns gawky ducklings into gliding swans. It's sloppy but mildly endearing. (Holden) 'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis) 'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis) 'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis) 'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis) Film Series COMEDY FORTNIGHT (Through Wednesday) The Two Boots Pioneer Theater's festival offers nightly screenings of ''Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story,'' starring Rob Corddry of ''The Daily Show'' as a disgraced paintball champion, and two more ''Best of First Sundays: A Hilarious Retrospective'' programs of film shorts.

(Sinagra) DAN BERN, KAKI KING (Tomorrow) Dan Bern is a wry singer-songwriter. Like Loudon Wainwright III, he puts his bitterness in the foreground, usually in the service of a pointed joke with a lefty edge. Kaki King is a multifaceted guitarist whose style is grounded in driving yet intricate rhythms. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) BLACK EYED PEAS, FLIPSYDE, PUSSYCAT DOLLS (Tonight) The Black Eyed Peas make lightweight hip-hop that revolves around the brash sexiness of the singer Fergie. Flipsyde is a socially conscious rap crew that incorporates some alt-rock. The Pussycat Dolls, a burlesque crew turned hit dance-pop act, make enticingly sassy boasts about their man-stealing skills. 7:30, Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $54.50. (Sinagra) MARSHALL CHAPMAN, JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight) The songwriter Marshall Chapman has been at it since 1973, and her songs, from ''Betty's Bein' Bad'' to ''Last Mango in Paris'' have been recorded by the likes of Crystal Gayle and Jimmy Buffet.

Doors open at 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, $25. (Sinagra) ELECTRIC SIX (Tuesday and Wednesday) Three years ago this Detroit garage band generated buzz with the smirking but rocking song ''Danger! High Voltage.'' Its latest album, ''Señor Smoke'' (Warner), never achieves dance-punk command, but the histrionic singer Dick Valentine and his boys know how to be manic. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $10. (Sinagra) BANNING EYRE WITH COUMBA SIDIBÉ (Tomorrow) The playing of the guitarist, author and African-music scholar Banning Eyre takes its cues from the fluid, nimble style of the West African guitarists who populate his CD ''In Griot Time.'' Tomorrow he will be joined by the deep-voiced Malian singer Coumba Sidibé and will play as part of her backing combo. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $10. (Sinagra) BELA FLECK & THE FLECKTONES (Tonight) Bela Fleck, a banjoist, has moved far beyond bluegrass technique. His own tunes feature odd meters and tricky structures, though his band can make them sound briskly mechanical. He has also applied his technique to the classical repertory for one more kind of crossover. 11:30, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Jon Pareles) KIRK FRANKLIN (Tomorrow) Kirk Franklin is a preacher, not a singer, but that hasn't kept him from selling millions of albums. He leads a troupe that meshes P-Funk grooves with messages of uplift, putting hip-hop rhythms behind the old-fashioned gospel dynamics of wide-open belting and jubilant choir singing, updating the music without sacrificing it to slickness. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $37 to $65. (Pareles) GHAZAL (Tuesday) Kayhan Kalhor, who plays a spike fiddle, and Shujaat Husain Khan, who plays sitar, weave classical Persian and Indian styles into improvisatory jams.

(Sinagra) GHOSTFACE KILLAH, DJ PREMIER, SLICK RICK (Tomorrow) There is lots of rapping lately about drugs and dealing, but the Wu Tang Clan alum Ghostface Killah brings a particular pathos to the rap game on his new ''Fishscale'' (Def Jam), cutting pure thrill with whiffs of regret. He is joined on the bill by the jazzy DJ Premier and the smooth storyteller Slick Rick. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $33. (Sinagra) GUSTER (Tonight) Guster, a band from Boston, has followed the Dave Matthews Band's playbook for building an audience: touring constantly and singing unabashedly earnest folk-rock songs about the painful uncertainties of friendship, love and growing up. 7, Hiro Ballroom, 366 West 17th Street, Chelsea, ticketweb.com or (866) 468-7619. (Sold out.) (Pareles) SEU JORGE (Thursday) This Brazilian singer may be best known here for his lilting samba covers of David Bowie songs in the movie ''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou'' and his role as Knockout Ned in ''City of God.'' His music avoids the traditional Brazilian styles, favoring crowd-pleasing funk-pop and loverman R & B. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan; (212) 777-6800; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sinagra) HUGH MASEKELA (Tuesday) The South African flugelhornist Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades, he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zigzagging possibilities of jazz. 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) VAN MORRISON (Monday) Van Morrison has flirted with country music before, but his latest album, ''Pay the Devil'' (Lost Highway), offers his slanted take on songs like Hank Williams's ''Your Cheatin' Heart'' and Rodney Crowell's ''Till I Gain Control Again.'' He's better at his own classic, agitated R & B but can certainly work up a surly-cowboy pique. 7:30 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, 3 (212) 307-7171; $79.50 and $149.50.(Sinagra) NOUVELLE VAGUE (Tonight) These French multi-instrumentalists have hit upon a lucrative shtick, covering jittery post-punk gems like Joy Division's dark, swirling ''Love Will Tear Us Apart'' as bossa nova chill-out music. 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Sinagra) SCISSOR SISTERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) These performance-artist glam rockers have both a healthy sense of irony and pop chops. Their exuberant ''Take Your Mama Out'' gained them a mainstream following. Tomorrow at 10 p.m., Sunday at 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) SECRET MACHINES (Wednesday) This psych-rock act harks back to both Led Zeppelin-style pummel and the ragtag explorations of the Flaming Lips, prizing epic live sound as much as headphone spaciousness. 9 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, ticketweb.com or (866) 468-7619. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) SUPERSUCKERS (Thursday) The Supersuckers play amiable Satanist speed-metal patterned on Motorhead's ''Ace of Spades.'' 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 777-6800 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $16.50.

(Sinagra) TOOTS & THE MAYTALS (Tonight) Toots Hibbert was the first Jamaican singer to put the term reggae in a song title; his ''Do the Reggay'' came out in 1968, when the rhythm was brand-new. He is reggae's long-running soul man, applying the gruff, gospel exuberance of Otis Redding to tales of prison, love, dancing and redemption. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $27.50. (Pareles) ALLEN TOUSSAINT (Sunday) This legendary New Orleans songwriter, producer and pianist has spent the months since Hurricane Katrina performing largely for the benefit of the continuing relief efforts in the Crescent City. Noon, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $30. (Sinagra) JOHN VANDERSLICE (Thursday) A collaborator of the Mountain Goats' clever songsmith John Darnielle, the strummy singer-songwriter Mr. Vanderslice also writes his own ruminative, though less clever songs. 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12. (Sinagra) VIKKU' VINAYAKRAM'S SAPTHAAKSHARA (Wednesday) The percussionist T. H. Vinayakram, known as Vikku, has made his name accompanying other Indian artists on the ghatam (clay pot), as well as working with John McLaughlin and Zakir Hussain in the group Shakti.

(Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. * KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The regal cabaret singer and the brassy songs of Kander and Ebb that she is offering in her new show may not be an obvious fit. But Ms. Akers locates the heart inside the brass and sass. 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; cover, $60, with a $20 minimum; $60 prix fixe dinner required on Thursdays and at the early shows tonight and tomorrow.

(Holden) BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs.

Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden) BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden) * MARY CLEERE HARAN (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) A wonderful no-frills singer with a sophisticated wit, Ms. Haran has a remarkable talent for simultaneously interpreting standards in the spirit in which they were written and looking at them through 21st-century eyes. 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $60 tonight and tomorrow; $50 Tuesday through Thursday.

A similar time warp occurs every time the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra performs Chico O'Farrill's ''Afro-Cuban Suite,'' as it plans to do here. 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $130. (Nate Chinen) MONTY ALEXANDER (Monday) With ''Concrete Jungle'' (Telarc), the Jamaican-born pianist Monty Alexander pays tribute to his countryman Bob Marley.

(Chinen) JOÃO BOSCO (Tuesday through April 30) Known in his early career as a hit-making songwriter for the Brazilian songbird Elis Regina, Mr. Bosco has been a popular singer on his own merits for some 20 years. But he rarely performs outside Brazil, which gives this engagement the tinge of a noteworthy event. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) MICHEL CAMILO TRIO (Tuesday through April 30) A percussive, often cathartic pianist, Mr. Camilo recently released a recording of Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' (Telarc) with a 95-piece symphony orchestra. His trio, with the bassist Charles Flores and the drummer Dafnis Prieto, can sometimes seem nearly as expansive. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) RON CARTER /KARRIN ALLYSON (Through Sunday) Mr. Carter, an august and influential bassist, has had mixed success as a bandleader; his best efforts usually involve the articulate pianist Stephen Scott, who joins him in this quartet. Ms. Allyson comes bearing a new album, ''Footprints'' (Concord), which delves into Jon Hendricks-style vocalese; as on the album, she digs in here with a strong ensemble spearheaded by the pianist Bruce Barth. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) GEORGE COLEMAN QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Fluent and fiery hard bop, from a well-traveled saxophonist and a rhythm section that includes the sharp pianist Anthony Wonsey and the hard-driving drummer Louis Hayes. 8, 10 and 11:30 p..m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $30. (Chinen) FREESTYLE JAZZ (Thursday) The avant-garde series formerly established at CBGB's Lounge now takes place every Thursday in a cozy side room adjoining an unassuming pub. This week's program offers three texture-minded trios, led by the trombonist Joe Fiedler, the trumpeter Roy Campbell Jr. and the multireedist Andrew Lamb. 8 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) BILL FRISELL QUINTET (Through Sunday, and Tuesday through April 30) On his latest Nonesuch releases -- ''East/West'' and ''Further East/Further West,'' both partly recorded at the Village Vanguard -- the guitarist Bill Frisell conjures a compelling hallucination of the American popular songbook, with Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen on bass and drums. The addition of the saxophonist Greg Tardy and the trumpeter Ron Miles alters the ensemble's chemistry as well as its size. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; $25 on Fridays and Saturdays; with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) ROBIN HOLCOMB (Tomorrow) Ms. Holcomb seeks out meditative spaces as both a pianist and a singer, and she softens her experimental urges with an enveloping sort of lyricism. For this rare unaccompanied performance, she revisits old pieces and introduces some new ones. 8:30 p.m., Location One, 20 Greene Street, between Canal and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen) DAVE KIKOSKI QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) A well-rounded pianist in the modern mainstream, Mr. Kikoski often does his best work as an accompanist, which is only one reason to applaud this group's inclusion of the tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) PAT MARTINO QUINTET (Through Sunday) The guitarist Pat Martino's new Blue Note album, ''Remember: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery,'' does exactly what it purports to do. And it works, because of the untroubled self-assurance of the emulation and the simple satisfaction of a hard-swinging band. 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 show tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) RENÉ McLEAN (Tonight) Mr. McLean, a saxophonist, leads an acoustic quartet in memory of his father, the alto saxophone legend Jackie McLean, who died three weeks ago. 7, Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $20. (Chinen) MYRA MELFORD (Tonight) Ms. Melford's solo piano playing is a study in subtle coloration and shifting grain, but it can also deliver the solid punch of the blues. 8:30 p.m., Location One, 20 Greene Street, between Canal and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen) FRANK MORGAN QUARTET (Through Sunday) Now in his 70's, the alto saxophonist Frank Morgan is one of the last survivors of the bebop era (and in his case, survivor is truly the appropriate term). He leads a sympathetic group consisting of John Hicks on piano, Curtis Lundy on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) MY EARS ARE BENT (Tuesday) This three-piece band, consisting of Ted Reichman on acoustic piano and electronics, Mary Halvorson on guitar and Ben Perowsky on drums, fashions an engrossingly layered chamber-music aesthetic that suggests more than a passing interest in independent rock. 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) ROY NATHANSON (Wednesday) ''Sotto Voce'' (Aum Fidelity), the new recording by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson, makes full use of his unusual skills as a conceptualist and raconteur. All the members of his band double on vocals, occasionally suggesting a literate and subversive barbershop quartet; one of them, Napoleon Maddox, provides the beat-box percussion that hustles the music along. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight and Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre. Tonight she plays and sings in a group featuring Bill Frisell and Tony Scherr on guitars, and Peter Scherr on bass, as part of the ''Live From Home'' series at the Housing Works Bookstore; on Tuesday she plays with yet another guitarist, Adam Levy, along with the pianist Art Hirahara and the bassist Matt Penman.

She shares a bill with Mr. Harris, a singer and pianist with a style patterned after Nat King Cole. 7:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $130. (Chinen) TERRASSON-OKEGWO-PARKER TRIO (Tuesday through April 30) Throughout the latter half of the 1990's, the pianist Jacky Terrasson led one of jazz's fresher-sounding acoustic piano trios, distinguished not only by his fluid pianism but also by the resonant bass tone of Ugonna Okegwo and the pared-down percussive drive of Leon Parker. Regrouping here, the musicians present themselves as a collective, which could well have positive implications for the music. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with additional 11:30 shows next Friday and April 29, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25; $30 next Friday and April 29. (Chinen) CHARLES TOLLIVER'S MUSIC INC. CONTINUUM (Tomorrow) In the 1970's, Music Inc. was a heavy-gauge quartet designed to showcase the exertions of a blazing young trumpeter named Charles Tolliver. This reincarnation features Mr. Tolliver, whose recent re-emergence has been a welcome bit of news, and Cecil McBee, his original bassist; the continuum comes in the form of two youngbloods, the pianist Robert Glasper and the drummer E. J. Strickland. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766 ; cover, $20.

This free concert aims to capture the fire of a performance in Mr. Weston's native Brooklyn seven years ago, which has been issued on CD as ''Spirit! The Power of Music'' (Sunnyside). 7 p.m., World Financial Center Winter Garden, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'LA BOHÈME' (Sunday) James Robinson's City Opera production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. Yunah Lee sings Mimi, Eric Fennell steps in as Rodolfo, Jennifer Black is Musetta, and Philip Torre sings Marcello. David Wroe conducts. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Jeremy Eichler) 'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) On opening night at the New York City Opera, Kate Aldrich came through in the title role, capturing not only Carmen's devilish seductiveness but also her radical protofeminist pride in her own independence. Unfortunately, there was scant chemistry between her and Robert Breault as Don José. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Eichler) 'DON GIOVANNI' (Tonight) The second cast will offer the season's final performance of Mozart's nearly perfect opera at City Opera. Timothy Kuhn, new to the company this season, sings the title role; also making a debut on this stage is Claudia Waite, as Donna Anna. 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Anne Midgette). * 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The veteran Austrian director Otto Schenk, who is also an acclaimed comic actor in his homeland, understands that the way to make a rich comic opera like Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' work is to treat it seriously. In his wonderful new production for the Met he accomplished this vividly. The cast is splendid, especially the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko, the dynamic young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien and, in the title role, the stylish Italian bass Simone Alaimo. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $205 tickets remaining tonight, $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LOHENGRIN' (Monday) While Wagner's sprawling opera is playing at the Met, the Alliance Players offer the New York premiere of ''Lohengrin'' by the Italian avant-gardist Salvatore Sciarrino. This one-act opera is entirely introspective, based on what the composer calls the ''invisible action'' unfolding inside Elsa's mind. In his music, Mr. Sciarrino often paints with the finest of brushes, hinting at deep emotion through compressed whispers and the rustling of wind. For adventurous listeners, his interiorized postscript to Wagner promises to be fascinating. 8 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100; $35. (Eichler) 'MISS LONELYHEARTS' (Wednesday) Juilliard has done much commissioning to celebrate its centennial this year, including a new opera that's been in progress for some time. Lowell Liebermann's piece is based on Nathanael West's novella, with a libretto by J. D. McClatchy, who has written or helped write librettos for significant works -- Tobias Picker's ''Emmeline,'' Lorin Maazel's ''1984,'' Ned Rorem's ''Our Town'' and Elliot Goldenthal's ''Grendel'' (opening at the Los Angeles Opera next month). Andreas Delfs conducts. 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 769-7406; $20, $10 for students and 65+. (Midgette). * 'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) After five months' absence, Jonathan Miller's handsome production has returned to the line-up at the Met with an almost entirely new cast. The soprano Andrea Rost and the bass-baritone John Relyea are endearing as Susanna and Figaro. And the mezzo-soprano Alice Coote, in her first appearances at the Met, has been winning praise for her rich-voiced portrayal of the hormonal page boy Cherubino. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 remaining tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Thursday. (Tommasini) 'SUSANNAH' (Tonight through Sunday) It's easy to poke fun at Carlisle Floyd's opera for its folksy score, run through with hymn tunes, square dances and Appalachian ditties. Yet the opera, more sophisticated than it appears, about a sensual young woman in rural Tennessee who inadvertently stirs up envy and desire among the townspeople, has been moving audiences since its premiere in 1956. The Dicapo Opera Theater presents a 50th-anniversary production, directed by Michael Capasso and conducted by Steven Osgood. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438 ext. 10; $47.50. (Tommasini) 'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Floria Tosca, opera's quintessential diva, is not a role for the fainthearted. Deborah Voigt, still searching for the perfect fit, role-wise, for her silvery voice, is taking it on at the Met for the first time. Franco Farina and James Morris can match her volume-wise if not with stylistic elegance. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $175 tickets remaining on Wednesday. (Midgette) Classical Music ALEXANDER STRING QUARTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) With lots of Beethoven under its collective belt, this San Francisco-based ensemble is no stranger to marathon performance cycles, and this coming week, it begins another lightning traversal, this time of Shostakovich's 15 string quartets. Tuesday's performance features Nos. 1, 2 and 3; Wednesday brings Nos. 4, 5 and 6. The five-concert series runs through May 1. 8 p.m., Baruch College Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (646) 312-4085; $25. (Eichler) AXIOM (Tonight) Jeffrey Milarsky conducts this newly hatched new-music chamber ensemble in Takemitsu's ''Tree Line,'' Birtwistle's ''Tragoedia,'' Webern's ''Konzert'' (Op. 24) and Steve Reich's ''City Life.'' 8, Studio 309, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, (212) 769-7406; free. (Allan Kozinn) OLGA BORODINA and ILDAR ABDRAZAKOV (Tuesday) The creamy-voiced, languid Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina is one of the best we have today, although her gifts as a recitalist are mixed; the voice is beautiful, the presentation has been somewhat passive. Her husband, a bass, joins her for a program of Russian music, including songs and arias by Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and others. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $85. (Midgette) BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Michael Christie, this orchestra's new music director, leads his charges in a program of symphonic pieces and songs celebrating contemporary urbanity, with the German cabaret star Ute Lemper as his soloist. Mr. Christie offers classic works by Bernstein, Gershwin, Copland, Eisler and Piazzolla, as well as more recent pieces by Heiner Goebbels, Kander and Ebb, and Chava Alberstein and Ms. Lemper's ''Ghosts of Berlin.'' 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60; $10 for students. (Kozinn) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) ''Discoveries and Masterworks'' is the name of this two-part program that combines staples of the repertory with less-known works. Sunday's program juxtaposes Schoenberg and Brahms, Kurtag and Schumann; Tuesday's, Brahms's Piano Quartet in G minor with Chausson and Boccherini. Sunday at 5, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49. (Midgette) * EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) Among the great composers of the 20th century, Shostakovich was the most inscrutable. But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary, and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. The quartet will perform them all, in chronological order, on five programs starting on Thursday. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60. (Tommasini) * MIDORI (Tuesday) Is Midori maturing into an adventurous performer? Her hefty contemporary program -- Judith Weir's ''Music for 247 Strings,'' Isang Yun's Violin Sonata, Lutoslawski's Partita and works by Gyorgy Kurtag and Alexander Goehr -- suggests a willingness to leave the instant crowd pleasers behind and take some chances. Her longtime accompanist, Robert McDonald, is at the piano. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $48 to $54. (Kozinn) * NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Monday) Joel Sachs leads his expert student ensemble in their final concert of season. The program, like many of Mr. Sachs's adventures, is international and far-flung, with works by Andrew Ford, from Australia; Ryan Francis, from the United States; Bernd Franke, from Germany; Jose Maceda, from the Philippines; and Milica Paranosic, from the former Yugoslavia. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn) * NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow) Mstislav Rostropovich approaches the music of Shostakovich with more authority and close personal knowledge than just about anyone. He returns to the Philharmonic to lead the composer's 10th Symphony and his gripping First Violin Concerto, with Maxim Vengerov as soloist. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $33 to $104. (Eichler) 'POCKET CONCERTOS' (Tomorrow) It's one thing to commission a new concerto; it's another to commission 12 of them. This weekend, Miller Theater introduces the first concert in a three-year project conceived to create works for soloists and sinfonietta by some of the theater's favorite composers. Two of the concertos on this first program are for piano -- John Musto will perform his own, and Ichizo Okashiro's will be played by his sister, Chitose -- one is for accordion, by Julia Wolfe; and Benedict Mason has written a double concerto for bass and tuba. George Steel, who runs the theater and conceived the project, conducts. 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $25. (Midgette) CHARLES ROSEN (Sunday) Not many pianists can give their own preconcert lecture with the erudition that Charles Rosen will very likely muster as he concludes his series on ''Mozart Within History.'' The theme of this third installment is Mozart's influence on later generations of Romantic composers. The talk begins at 1:30 p.m., followed by the recital at 3 p.m., with works by Mozart, Schubert, Chopin and Liszt. Fred Sherry (cello) and David Bowlin (violin) join along the way. 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Eichler) * VOICES OF ASCENSION (Wednesday) This superb church choir, led by Dennis Keene, goes ecumenical in a program devoted to Hebrew sacred settings, namely Bernstein's ''Chichester Psalms'' and Ernest Bloch's ''Avodath Hakodesh,'' a setting of the Sabbath morning service. 8 p.m., Church of the Ascension, Fifth Avenue at 10th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 358-1469; $10 to $45. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. BALLET FiESTA MEXICANA (Tonight through Sunday) Yloy Ybarra's company returns in a program of work from Mexico, with live music performed by the group Semilla. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m. Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880; $25 to $30. (Jennifer Dunning) URSULA EAGLY AND REBECCA DAVIS (Thursday) Ms. Eagly and her ''Nobody Try to Be a Hero,'' inspired by the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002, return for another viewing in a shared program with Ms. Davis, whose ''The birds are here. I hear them.'' was inspired partly by Japanese classical poetry and chemical compounds. (Through April 29.) 8 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101; $15. (Queens residents pay what they wish on Thursdays.) (Dunning) E-MOVES (Tonight through Sunday) They've thought of everything here, with programs of ''E-Merging'' and ''E-Volving'' dance by 13 choreographers and companies (tonight, Sunday and April 29) and ''E-STablished'' dance by Cynthia Oliver's COCo Dance Theater and by Arthur Aviles Typical Theater; the Aviles troupe will perform choreography set to 1950's music by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz (tomorrow, next Friday and April 30). Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 3 p.m., Aaron Davis Hall, City College, West 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100; $18 per program, $26 for both. (Dunning) GORILLA FEST (Tonight and tomorrow) Bill Young and Colleen Thomas have chosen new dance, music, video and installation work by their company dancers and guests for this alternative SoHo festival, which takes place in two theaters. The participants include Jonah Bokaer, Sharon Estacio and Pedro Osorio. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, the Puffin Room, 435 Broome Street, at Broadway, and at 9 p.m., Hundred Grand, 100 Grand Street, at Mercer Street, (212) 925-6573; $15; students and 65+, $12. (Dunning) MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY (Today and Tuesday) The big event in the company's slightly threadbare 80th-anniversary season came earlier this week, but ancillary activities continue. Today is the fourth day of free lunchtime performances, three each day, from noon to 1 p.m., of Graham's solo ''Lamentation'' in the windows above the entrance to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts on Lincoln Center Plaza. Also at noon today, at the 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, will be a free performance illustrating the evolution of Graham's ''Appalachian Spring.'' Reservations recommended: (212) 415-5553. At 12:30 p.m. today is a free performance at the Guggenheim Museum (after payment of the museum's entry fee) of the Graham solos ''Satyric Festival Song'' and ''Deep Song.'' And on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., again at the Guggenheim, there will be an exhibition and what the company calls a ''live showcase'' of ''Lamentation''; $10; (212) 423-3587. More details: marthagraham.org. (John Rockwell) HEDWIG DANCES (Thursday) From Chicago, this august modern-dance troupe will perform work by Jan Bartoszek (the company's artistic director), Jan Eckert and Maray Gutierrez that has been inspired by themes ranging from Goya's ''Caprichos'' to the intimate rules of the bath. (Through April 30.) 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $18; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) MARK JARECKE PROJECT (Thursday) Mr. Jarecke's ''Everything Up Until Now and Including'' is an evening-long and physically demanding solo performed by, and created in collaboration with, Andrea Johnston. (Through April 30.) 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St, Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Jack Anderson) * AKRAM KHAN (Wednesday) The United States premiere of a commissioned work, ''ma'' (''earth''), by this fashionable and successful London-based, Kathak-trained choreographer. Wednesday, next Friday and April 29, 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500 or lincolncenter.org; $30 to $58. (Rockwell) * RICHARD MOVE (Thursday) Opening on Thursday for two weekends, Mr. Move, fresh from his duet with Desmond Richardson at the Martha Graham Dance Company gala on Tuesday, will present ''The Show (Achilles Heels).'' This megahip take on things Greek will offer Deborah Harry (a k a Blondie) singing live songs as Athena, and Rasta Thomas as Achilles, originally performed by Mikhail Baryshnikov in the piece's out-of-town White Oak Dance Project premiere in 2002. The cast also includes Katherine Crockett from the Graham company. Arto Lindsay did the score. Thursday through April 29 and May 2 through 6, 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 11, or thekitchen.org; $20. (Rockwell) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tuesday through Thursday) The company's spring season gets under way on Tuesday with a run of Balanchine's full-evening ''Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Maria Kowroski, back from a virus-induced absence, dances Titania on Thursday night. (The season, which includes seven Diamond Project choreographic premieres, continues until June 25.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or nycballet.org; $30 to $86; student rush, $15. (Rockwell) 1.2.3. FESTIVAL (Tuesday) Three talented junior companies of major dance groups -- Ailey II, American Ballet Theater Studio Company and Taylor 2 -- present works. (Each offers programs of its own, through May 7.) 7 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $50. (Anderson) STEPHEN PETRONIO COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) What do you get when you mix the singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, the Young People's Chorus of New York City and Stephen Petronio's extravagant movement language? A concert not to be missed. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $40. (Claudia La Rocco) SILVER-BROWN DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) The company will perform dances by Eva Silverstein to music by Otis Redding. (Through April 29.) 7:30 p.m., Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (718) 623-3294; $100. (Dunning) * SOURCING STRAVINSKY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Six choreographers take on Stravinsky, with Yvonne Rainer (in a rare new dance work) addressing both Stravinsky and Balanchine's ''Agon.'' The other choreographers are Cynthia Hopkins, Dayna Hanson and Linas Phillips, David Neumann and Rennie Harris. 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org; $15 and $25. (Rockwell) SYMPHONY SPACE DANCE SAMPLER (Tomorrow) What looks like a roster of hundreds of dance companies and individuals in all styles, some hot and some not, will perform in this 12-hour marathon. 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10 per three-hour segment. (Dunning) AYNSLEY VANDENBROUCKE MOVEMENT GROUP (Wednesday) Circles symbolize communities in ''Full Circle,'' to be danced in the round with flashlights providing the only lighting. (Through April 29.) 8 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444 or www.smarttix.com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Anderson) YOUTH AMERICA GRAND PRIX 2006 GALA (Tomorrow and Sunday) Professional ballet dancers share the stage with winners of the Youth America ballet competition in ''Stars of Today Meet the Stars of Tomorrow,'' the contest's culminating gala. The already starry types include Igor Zelensky of the Kirov Ballet, Darcey Bussell of the Royal Ballet, and the Americans Karine Plantadit, fresh from ''Movin' Out''; Wendy Whelan of the New York City Ballet; and Marcelo Gomes and David Hallberg of American Ballet Theater. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.nycitycenter.org; $35 to $150. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY): FEMALE RESPONSES TO THE CLASSICAL IDEAL IN AMERICAN DECORATIVE ARTS,' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Smith) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' through May 14. This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Michael Kimmelman) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck) Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. (See above.) (Smith) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) * The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. At the same time, the show is far from didactic. It's beautiful, sexy and, in the case of Raqib Shaw's painting and Kutlug Ataman's video of Sufi meditation, ecstatic. (See above.) (Cotter) National Academy Museum: 'Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church,' through April 30. Exquisite small landscape studies by the best of the Hudson River School painters. They are from the collection at Olana, the Persian-style Victorian mansion -- now a museum -- that Church built on an upstate hill overlooking the Hudson River. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880. (Ken Johnson) NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now,' through May 1. A snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally savvy 21st-century China, this show has two fine pieces by Cao Fei, who has garnered much attention recently. It is also the occasion for several worthy New York debuts. Some of the art is light, slight, and MTV-ish, but artists like Cui Xiuwen, Xu Zhen, Li Songhua, Xu Tan, Meng Jin and Dong Wensheng give us a lot. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084.(Cotter) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art, abstraction. This show is stylishly installed (one gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer); the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown * ECHOES FROM THE STEPPES: MONGOLIAN 17TH-, 18TH- AND 19TH-CENTURY BRONZES AND PAINTINGS The bronzes represent the four styles of Mongolian religious sculpture, but the main event is the 77 sakhuis paintings -- small, finely wrought, richly colored portraits of Buddhist priests and protective or wrathful deities that the nomadic Mongols wore, framed in silver, as amulets. E. & J. Frankel, 1040 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 879-5733, through May 6. (Smith) '1968: All in a Dream' In 1968 the photographer Lenny Gottlieb saved 30,000 snapshots that were supposed to have been thrown out at the photographic processing lab where he was working. Approximately 500 of them are on view here; collectively, they offer an enthralling cross-section of American life during a year of tremendous change. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through April 29. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo 'When Artists Say We' This timely sociological experiment of a show features 17 artists or artist groups who were invited to create wall-diagrams or mini-exhibitions reflecting on the social networks out of which contemporary art emerges. Artists Space, 38 Green Street, (212) 226-3970, through April 29. (Johnson) Other Galleries 'B-Side' This engaging group show includes Tim Spelios's beautifully made Surrealistic drum set in which the components are square rather than round; Matt Freedman's life-size sculpture of a boy with a lion's teeth and elephant eyes; Mary Carlson's crocheted works, resembling splats of blood on the wall; Joyce Pensato's expressionistically painted clown face; Judith Page's ghoulish and viscous small portraits; Meredith Allen's funny and scary photographs of dogs; and a painting by Jim Torok that declares: ''You have no worries. Things are going well. Don't wake up.'' Sarah Bowen, 210 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-4517, through April 30. (Johnson) 'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through Oct. 16. (Johnson) Last Chance PETER BEGLEY Parisian esprit enlivens Peter Begley's latest multipanel paintings. Their motif is the cornice: a ubiquitous emblem of Baron Haussmann's grand boulevards, which, abstracted and made delicately ornate, permits Mr. Begley to add illusory depth to his usual richly worked, waxy fields of warm color. Partly the filigree, partly the gentle rapture with his recently adopted city give to these new works a bit of the élan of old Raoul Dufy. Salander-OReilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606; through tomorrow. (Kimmelman) 'JANE FREILICHER: NEAR THE SEA: PAINTINGS 1958-63 The beautifully relaxed, nearly abstract paintings that were Jane Freilicher's initial response to the vistas of eastern Long Island add a surprising piece to the unruly puzzle of late-1950's art and sharpen your sense of her ambition and achievement. Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050; through tomorrow. (Smith) NAN GOLDIN: 'CHASING A GHOST' A riveting if flawed three-screen video projection titled ''Sisters, Saints & Sibyls'' hauntingly details the trauma that drives Ms. Goldin's invasive, yet oddly solitary photographs, as well as her lifelong battle with addiction.Its unalloyed honesty offers extreme evidence that most art begins in an attempt to heal a deep psychic wound. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200; through tomorrow. (Smith) Markus Hansen: 'Other People's Feelings Are Also My Own' In high-definition video projections of pairs of photographs, Mr. Hansen, a Paris-based German artist, dresses like and adopts the facial expression of the man, woman or child in the picture next to his.

It was the first question that the punk legend and occasional film actor Henry Rollins asked a soldier named Andy who was standing in line to meet him one afternoon last August. Rollins and Andy were in a small, half-empty cafeteria on a military base in Izmir, Turkey. The two men made for an interesting contrast: the lanky 20-something soldier who looked downright shy despite his camouflage uniform and black boots, and the 44-year-old, heavily tattooed, obviously muscled Rollins, who appeared the more menacing, despite his boyish shorts and gray tucked-in T-shirt. Rollins was at the base as an entertainer with the U.S.O., making a stop on what the organization calls a handshake tour, a chance for soldiers to meet a celebrity one on one. Fliers taped around the cafeteria promoted the event, showing a picture of Rollins with his two forefingers pointing out, like a version of Uncle Sam with a graying buzz cut: he wants you! The American soldiers who provide security at the Turkish base were mostly off that day, but several made a point of coming by to meet Rollins, and the line slowly grew, as men finished plates of spaghetti and made their way over to where Rollins was standing.",

Representative John Gleason in Michigan, a Democrat, proposed a bill yesterday that would bar industrial banks like the one Wal-Mart is seeking to start. Brian Moe, a Democrat the lower house in Maryland, introduced legislation yesterday that would ban Wal-Mart bank branches from its stores. Industrial banks can accept deposits and lend money, raising the possibility that Wal-Mart could open branches in its more than 3,300 United States stores. Wal-Mart has said its bank, to be based in Salt Lake City, would be used for credit card processing to cut fees the chain pays and that it had no plans to open retail banking operations. ''We have no intention of doing what they seem to be trying to prevent,'' a Wal-Mart spokesman, Marty Heires, said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) More Internal Accounting Problems at HealthSouth The HealthSouth Corporation said yesterday that it still had problems with internal financial controls after a huge accounting fraud and would post losses for 2005 that were at least $260 million greater than the previous year. The company, which operates a rehabilitation and medical services chain, made the announcement in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and said its annual report for last year would be delayed until March 31. HealthSouth, which is based in Birmingham, said a report from its accounting firm will contain an ''adverse opinion'' of the company's financial controls, which were revamped after a $2.7 billion accounting fraud that nearly drove the company to bankruptcy after it was revealed in 2003.

(AP) Canada's Case Against U.S. Lumber Tariffs Advances A North American trade panel ruled yesterday that the United States erred in setting duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. The ruling was made by a panel set up under the North American Free Trade Agreement in a decades-long dispute and could affect more than $4 billion in duties already paid by Canadian sawmills. Canada said the panel's unanimous decision meant that the duties had to be scrapped and that money collected since 2002 be refunded, but the United States Commerce Department said it might continue the battle with an appeal to a Nafta extraordinary challenge committee. Washington and the United States lumber industry argue that Canada's timber industry is unfairly subsidized. Canada rejects the subsidy accusations and argues the duties were imposed to protect forestry operations in the United States that are too inefficient to compete in a free market. (REUTERS) U.S. Seeks Trade Ruling Against Canadian Corn Tariffs The United States appealed yesterday to the World Trade Organization to get Canada to drop duties of $1.65 a bushel on corn imports, arguing that Canadian procedures for imposing the tariffs violate international trade rules. The filing kicks off a 60-day period of mandatory consultations between the countries at the W.T.O. in Geneva. If the two sides cannot negotiate a solution, the United States can ask the W.T.O. to adjudicate the case after those 60 days are up. The United States argues that Canadian law is not consistent with W.T.O. rules because it does not force Canadian trade authorities to prove that farmers are being hurt by United States imports. Canada argues that the United States subsidizes its corn producers and that exporters are dumping their crop at below-market rates into Canada.

When she appeared in court on Monday, she was spared jail time but, under a plea deal with the Manhattan district attorney's office, accepted three years' probation and agreed to attend anger management classes. Minutes later, she tried to return to the courtroom and withdraw her plea, contending that she had been rushed into her decision, said Edison Alban, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office.

At the East End Community Center in Bridgeport, those seeking a meal no longer have hotdogs and frozen dinners as options. The loss of choices is emblematic of deeper shortages in the state's food pantries, shelters and soup kitchens, said people in charge of running or supplying those organizations. And the reason for the shortages is, in part, a result of competition with relief efforts for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and, in part, a result of increasing demand for food, they said.",

Last Friday, the network unveiled a rejiggered lineup featuring the move of ''Las Vegas'' from Tuesday and ''Conviction,'' the new legal drama from Dick Wolf, the creator of ''Law & Order.'' The schedule gained ground on CBS, which has dominated Friday nights all season, but didn't manage to win outright. NBC was No. 1 among adults 18 to 49, with an average of 11.04 million viewers in primetime. (''Las Vegas'' drew 10.87 million and ''Conviction'' 10.15 million.) But CBS managed to bring in 11.88 million; its biggest draw was ''Ghost Whisperer'' with Jennifer Love Hewitt (12.28 million) at 8 p.m., which faced down NBC's game show ''Deal or No Deal'' (12.09 million). Without the Friday results show of ''Dancing With the Stars,'' ABC fell to third place for the night. Its ''In Justice'' particularly suffered from the absence of ''Dancing,'' bringing in only 6.6 million viewers. KATE AURTHUR",

He also has a more diffident side that's no less ambitious. Mr. Albarn is the mastermind of Gorillaz, a group whose public image is of four cartoon characters created by JAMIE HEWLETT. With Gorillaz, Mr. Albarn has shifted from frontman to éminence grise, performing in the shadows while he shepherds the many Gorillaz collaborators. To answer the question of how a two-dimensional studio-concocted band can play concerts, Gorillaz tours by appearing behind a scrim onstage with guests out front. This time, the group is arriving in New York City for a five-night stand, performing songs from the album ''Demon Days'' at the intimate Apollo Theater with an assortment of guest stars only Mr. Albarn could devise. Among them are the hip-hop group DE LA SOUL, the rhythm-and-blues innovator IKE TURNER and SHAUN RYDER, the floppy-limbed leader of the 1980's Manchester band Happy Mondays. The songs are Mr. Albarn's: loping, groove-based tunes that get their vamps from reggae, funk, rock and hip-hop. So are the weary lead vocals and the temperament behind them, which sees Western culture slipping into violence, environmental disaster and the self-delusion cultivated by entities like ''Feel Good Inc.'' That doesn't stop Gorillaz from setting its dire warnings to cheery dance tunes; ''We ain't got a chance,'' goes one bouncy chorus. The songs' sense of looming disaster won't stop the beat. The Gorillaz shows sold out fast. Those left out can wait for the DVD, or for a promised holographic Gorillaz tour in 2007.

Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman from Feb. 14 through March 26. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'LOVELY DAY' Tiresome evening (1:15). Beckett Theater, Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway * 'APARTMENT 3A' Jeff Daniels's romance about a woman who lost her faith is written with wit, conviction and a real affection for its characters (1:30). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street; (212) 352-0255. (Zinoman) 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) 'SAFETY' A cynical, contrived portrayal of the life of a war photographer that attacks its subject with a heavy hand (1:25). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman). * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101.

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'HARVEST' Manjula Padmanabhan's sci-fi parable is a dark fantasy about a high-tech racket in body organs -- a cross between the 2002 thriller ''Dirty Pretty Things'' and an episode of ''The Twilight Zone.'' Based in Delhi, India, Ms. Padmanabhan wrote the play in 1996; this is its New York premiere (1:25). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710; closing Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban) * '(I AM) NOBODY'S LUNCH' The elusive nature of truth in a culture swamped with stuff that looks, sounds and smells like information -- but may be something a little more suspicious -- is the serious subject of this merrily unserious, vaudevillian romp through the anxious chatter of contemporary America. Snappy, scrappy and performed with a youthful blend of earnestness and deadpan razzmatazz by the buzzed-about downtown troupe the Civilians (1:30). 59E59, 59 East 59th Street; (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Nathan Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) 'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'LA PETITE JERUSALEM' (No rating, 96 minutes, in French and Hebrew) In her sensitive but overly schematic debut feature, the filmmaker Karin Albou reflects on the lives of two women living in an Orthodox Jewish enclave in a Parisian banlieue. (Lee) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee)'THE TOLLBOOTH' (No rating, 85 minutes) In ''The Tollbooth,'' 22-year-old Sarabeth Cohen (Marla Sokoloff) narrates the travails of her Jewish American family and her own coming of age. Written and directed with overwhelming earnestness by Debra Kirschner, the movie presents a sincere attempt to address the opposing tugs of tradition and modernity, but is undermined by dated dialogue and a reliance on stereotype. Would a modern Jewish mother really insist that a daughter's lesbianism was a reaction to overwork? (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series ANOTHER SPANISH CINEMA: FILMS IN CATALUNYA 1906-2006 (Through Feb. 14) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Catalan film continues this weekend with Antoni Ribas's ''Burned City'' (1976), one of the first Catalan-language films released after the death of Franco; and Vicente Aranda's ''Fata Morgana'' (1965-67), a Barcelona School collage that includes Pop Art, performance art and images from Richard Lester's Beatles movies. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13.) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year. It begins on Thursday with three films set in Iraq: ''The Tenth Planet, a Single Life in Baghdad'' (2004), Melis Birder's portrait of a secretary's everyday life; ''Terror'' (2005), the Termite TV Collective's visual essays about the current war; and ''The Liberace of Baghdad'' (2004), Sean McAllister's portrait of Samir Peter, a concert pianist reduced to playing in a hotel bar. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program honoring Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82) continues this weekend with ''The Bitter Tears of Petra van Kant'' (1972), his drama about an arrogant fashion designer (Margit Carstensen) who falls in love with a model (Hanna Schygulla). 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Feb. 12) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. This weekend's films include two stories set in Paris. ''The Last Flight'' (1931), selected by Lou Lumenick, is William Dieterle's Lost Generation drama about American fliers in France just after World War I. Ernst Lubitsch's ''Ninotchka'' (1939), selected by Leah Rozen, stars Greta Garbo as a stern Russian comrade seduced by everything Parisian. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) KARLOFF (Through Thursday) Film Forum's 14-movie festival honoring the great horror star Boris Karloff (1887-1969) begins this weekend with two double features. James Whale's ''Frankenstein'' (1931), starring Karloff as the monster, and Charles Brabin's ''Mask of Fu Manchu'' (1932), with Myrna Loy as co-star, will be shown today and tomorrow. Whale's tongue-in-cheek sequel ''Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935) and Karl Freund's tale of the return of Imhotep, ''The Mummy'' (1932), play on Sunday. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates) NEW YORK 10th SEPHARDIC JEWISH FILM FESTIVAL (Through Wednesday) The American Sephardi Federation, Sephardic House and the Yeshiva University Museum sponsor this event.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. THE ACADEMY IS , PANIC! AT THE DISCO, ACCEPTANCE, HELLOGOODBYE (Wednesday) Both the Chicago emo band the Academy Is and Panic! at the Disco were discovered by the pop-punk hitmakers Fall Out Boy. Both play a similar sort of anthemic, stop-start rock, the Academy Is boasting a histrionic front man, and Panic! at the Disco employing drum-machine mechanics. Acceptance and Hellogoodbye also play. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16.50 (sold out). (Laura Sinagra) BABY LOVES DISCO, THE RUB (Tomorrow) Because it's important to introduce your hipster child to good clubs and good music very early, the eclectic hip-hop, funk and global beat mavens DJ Ayres and Cosmo Baker spin a family-friendly afternoon play-date set. Later, they kick the kiddies out and proceed with their monthly dance party called the Rub. 2 to 5 p.m. (Baby Loves Disco), Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $10 ($40 family rate, limit of 5 people). The Rub begins at 10 p.m.; $5 for women; $10 for men. (Sinagra) GLENN BRANCA'S HALLUCINATION CITY: SYMPHONY 13 FOR 100 GUITARS (Tomorrow) One way to hear music is as a convergence of physics and psychology, exploring the ways certain wave forms affect human perception. Since the 1980's, Glenn Branca has been investigating the subtleties of tunings and overtones, creating instruments and compositions that provide an eerie immersion in pure sound. A hundred guitars should make a mighty noise. 7:30 p.m., Montclair State University, Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112; $25. (Jon Pareles) BURNSIDE PROJECT (Wednesday) The Burnside Project plays its guitars in the intermittently splashing indie-rock style of the slacker 90's but uses electronic burbles beneath them. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sinagra) CALLA (Tomorrow) Burrowing into the dark corners of New Wave's shiny, happy side, the band Calla offers something more than brooding and vintage black couture. 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sinagra) BLUES FALLIN' DOWN LIKE RAIN: THE MUSIC OF ELIZABETH COTTEN (Wednesday) The guitarist and composer Elizabeth Cotten (1895-1983) added a new dimension to finger-picking blues guitar with her upside-down, left-handed playing on songs like ''Freight Train.'' Her music is honored here by the guitarists Taj Mahal, Mike Seeger, Jolie Holland and Carla Kihlstedt and Mark Orton. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $35. (Sinagra) A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS (Thursday) The former hairdresser Michael Score is etched in the minds of 80's MTV watchers as much for his sculpturally ambitious hairstyles as for songs like ''I Ran'' and the hit ''Wishing.'' He has less hair and new bandmates now. 8 p.m., Crash Mansion, 199 the Bowery, at Spring Street, Lower East Side, (212) 982-0740; $20. (Sinagra) HACKENSAW BOYS (Tomorrow) The eight-member Virginia band Hackensaw Boys plays raw traditional bluegrass with lots of fast fiddling, banjoing, speedy stomps and ripe hollers. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) HEM (Thursday) Against an orchestral backdrop and acoustic guitars, Sally Ellyson whispers and coos Dan Messe's songs in muslin tones. It's a style that recalls dreamy early 90's indie Americana pop. 8:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9958; $20 to $45. (Sinagra) HIGH ON FIRE (Tonight) This dark metal band's recent work with the producer Steve Albini highlights its precision. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra) BILLY JOEL (Thursday) The piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50 (sold out). (Sinagra) THE JUAN MACLEAN (Tomorrow) These know-it-all hipster musicologists play electro disco that sounds like post-industrial slackers having a party in a junk shop, dancing freely. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111 ; $15. (Sinagra) DANIEL LANOIS (Tonight) The producer and atmospheric musician Daniel Lanois here showcases the soundtrack for his experimental film ''Silvio'' with a group that includes the vocalist Lori Anna Reid, the guitarist Jim Wilson and the drummer Brian Blade. 8:30, Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 and $35. (Sinagra) JENNY LEWIS WITH THE WATSON TWINS (Sunday) The Rilo Kiley frontwoman Jenny Lewis's solo material is inspired by Laura Nyro-style 70's white soul. Her combination of school-recital fussiness and barely-caught cry is in fine form, but it's her vocal tone and phrasing that make her special. Especially here, where her pointy songbird desperation is augmented by gospel's Watson Twins. 7 p.m., Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20. (Sinagra) LOW (Tonight and Monday) For more than a decade, this Duluth, Minn., trio has been writing storm-cloud songs that evoke expansive sadness and long, cold distance. Tonight at 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $15 (sold out). Monday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra) AIMEE MANN (Thursday) Ms. Mann's recent concept album about two addicts in the 70's who meet at the Virginia fairgrounds features the astute, sad lyrics and low-key but enduring melodic hooks that this singer-songwriter is known for. Chuck Prophet also plays. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $25 to $35. (Sinagra) RICKY MARTIN (Monday) This Puerto Rican pop superstar, who has been keeping a relatively low profile since his 90's heyday, returns to the spotlight. You wonder if he will incorporate any reggaéton into his act. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; $50.50 to $120.50.(Sinagra) MATT POND P.A., DIOS (MALOS) (Tuesday) The band Matt Pond P.A. has lots of nicely formed indie-pop songs, none very memorable. Live, however, the band, which features a cello, delivers with a forceful crispness. Dios (Malos), a laid-back California quintet, plays shaggy indie-rock marked by questing vocals, dream-pop harmonies and a kind of acoustic-electronic psychedelia that conjures a couch daydream rather than a desert drive. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side; (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) GEAROID OhALLMHURAIN AND PATRICK OURCEAU (Tonight) The University of Missouri professor and concertina player Gearoid OhAllmhurain specializes in the traditional songs of his native County Clare. He plays with a sometime collaborator, the French fiddler Patrick Ourceau. 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950; $15 free to members and N.Y.U. students. (Sinagra) RAIN (Tonight) Bi (pronounced Bee), the Korean soap-opera heartthrob and pan-Asian pop star whose name translates as Rain, has soaked up English-speaking pop, from Michael Jackson to Usher. He croons ballads, steps through dance tunes and even raps a little, all in Korean, and this concert is part of his long-term plan to add the United States to his fan base. 8:30, Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $60 to $150. (Pareles) RACHEL SAGE (Thursday) This local singer-songwriter makes piano pop folk. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) JULIA SARR AND PATRICE LAROSE (Tuesday) The New York Guitar Festival brings to town the West African vocalist Julia Sarr and the guitarist Patrice Larose, who together make introspective music combining the Senegalese and flamenco traditions. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $15. (Sinagra) SIGUR ROS, AMINA (Thursday) The Icelandic atmospherists Sigur Ros continue to pursue the hope and dread of open expanse and to conjure with their sung gibberish a kind of ur-poetry. Amina is an all-female string quartet that similarly muses on vastness. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, , (212) 465-6741; $38 to $58.50. (Sinagra) Supergrass (Thursday) This buoyant, hooky mid-90's Brit-pop band had a sound more glammy than Oasis's and heftier than Blur's.

WARD (Tonight) The echoing guitar folk-pop songs of this singer-songwriter combine heartfelt campfire zeal with the ruminative sadness of midtempo 70's AM radio hits.

(Chinen) ADAM MAKOWICZ TRIO (Wednesday through Feb. 11) Mr. Makowicz has been a powerful if sometimes elusive presence in jazz since moving to the United States from Poland nearly 30 years ago; his crystalline piano technique is well supported here by the drummer Al Foster and the bassist George Mraz. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA, MARK DRESSER, GERRY HEMINGWAY (Tonight) This is strenuous experimentalism, but not without a point: Mr. Mahanthappa's flinty alto saxophone tone should abrade effectively against Mr. Dresser's probing bass playing and Mr. Hemingway's textural percussion. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $10.

(Chinen) COOPER-MOORE (Sunday) Cooper-Moore is an extreme polyglot, even by avant-garde standards, as he demonstrates in two afternoon sets: first singing, manipulating electronics and playing percussion with the cellist Nioka Workman and the keyboardist Matt Motel; then playing piano and a host of other instruments, alongside Assif Tsahar on reeds and Chad Taylor on drums. 1:30 and 3 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681; cover, $10 per set; $7 for students; free for children 14 and under.

But he has only rarely led his own group in a New York club residency, which makes this quartet engagement -- with the pianist Michael Weiss, the bassist John Webber and the drummer Lewis Nash -- a sort of landmark event. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum.

With her dusky-toned and exciting voice, Ms. Netrebko gives an unusually emotional portrayal of Gilda. Mr. Villazón infuses the role of the Duke of Mantua with an ardent voice, Verdian style and virile energy. The baritone Carlo Guelfi makes a stolid but finally sympathetic Rigoletto. Plácido Domingo, who knows a thing or two about the lead tenor role, conducts. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The soprano Angela Gheorghiu, who first gained international attention for her portrayal of Verdi's Violetta in performances conducted by Georg Solti, sings the role at the Met. Like others before her, she will have to contend with Franco Zeffirelli's overblown production. Still, she should be abetted by Jonas Kaufmann, a handsome and highly touted German tenor, who is making his Met debut. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Tuesday. (Tommasini) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tonight) The Metropolitan Opera evidently thinks that Julie Taymor's pageant of a ''Zauberflöte,'' with its wonderful puppets and game-show-style sets, is attraction enough that it can fill it with a less-known, largely homegrown cast. The spectacle is undeniable and sometimes beautiful, but ultimately seems empty without stronger musical values, though Mary Dunleavy does her best as a capable Pamina. Still, the Met is evidently right, because tonight's performance will probably be sold out. 8, Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; returned tickets may be available. (Anne Midgette) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the city's more inviting settings for chamber music.

(Eichler) MICHAEL GORDON (Tomorrow) This inventive composer has undertaken several collaborations in recent years with the filmmaker Bill Morrison, whose preferred medium at the moment is disintegrating silent film stock from around the 1920's. The poor condition of the film creates imagery of its own -- bubbles, blobs and amorphous shapes that recall those of the psychedelic light shows of the late 1960's. More to the point, it usually matches the impulses of Mr. Gordon's eclectic music. The program includes the premiere of ''Who by Water,'' as well as two older works, ''Light Is Calling'' and ''Gotham.'' 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20.

(Eichler) STEVEN ISSERLIS (Tuesday) A distinctive and quirky artist, this cellist is joined by the pianist Ana-Maria Vera for his New York recital debut, a program with an intriguing twist: every composer on the program acted as a mentor to the one after him, from Mendelssohn and Schumann to Suk and Martinu. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Midgette) JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) In the spirit of its idiosyncratic founder, Jens Nygaard, this feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and major works. This week the ensemble's guests are Désirée Halac, a mezzo-soprano; Philippe Quint, a violinist; and Benjamin Hochman, a pianist, who will collaborate on a tasty program that includes songs by Brahms, the Schumann Piano Trio No. 2, a wind sextet by Reinecke and a string quintet by Zemlinsky. 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259; $10 to $25. (Kozinn) STEVEN MACKEY (Thursday) At his best, this American composer writes pieces that draw from his training as a rigorous modernist and his experience as a dynamic rock guitarist. He will talk about this, while introducing and participating in a program of his works in one of Carnegie Hall's Making Music programs. The Brentano String Quartet and the Prism saxophone quartet are among the performers. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20. (Tommasini) EKATERINA MECHETINA (Sunday) This 20-something Russian pianist, who studied in Moscow, won the World Piano Competition in Cincinnati in 2004, and this weekend claims a New York recital as her prize.

This weekend and Tuesday, Jeffrey Kahane conducts and is the soloist for two piano concertos, and also leads the E-flat Sinfonia Concertante. Beginning Thursday, Lorin Maazel conducts four performances of the last three symphonies. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6000; $26 to $94. (Holland) ORLANDO CONSORT (Tuesday) This a cappella ensemble has made several beautifully sung thematic recordings for Harmonia Mundi, with texts so copious that the label has produced them as miniature hard-cover books. The latest, ''The Rose, the Lily and the Whortleberry,'' explores the use of floral imagery by medieval and Renaissance composers to describe both physical and heavenly love. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $25. (Kozinn) EMMANUEL PAHUD and YEFIM BRONFMAN (Tuesday) Mr. Pahud, the popular Swiss flutist, is joined by the accomplished pianist for sonatas by Reinecke, Brahms and Prokofiev. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $44 to $52.

It continues tomorrow with Dawn Upshaw, the Kronos Quartet and the Andalucian Dogs on a program of arrangements and original music by Mr. Golijov including his ''Ayre,'' a heady song cycle that draws on the folk and pop traditions of the Mediterranean. On Wednesday, the St. Lawrence String Quartet is joined by the cellist David Finckel and the clarinetist Todd Palmer for more Golijov chamber music and Schubert's Cello Quintet. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street; Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $65 tomorrow, $45 on Wednesday.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Art Fairs '10TH ANNIVERSARY BLACK FINE ART SHOW' Most of the significant names in African-American art history will be represented in a fair that is unique in New York for its dedication to black artists. The general quality is usually uneven, but chances are you will find lots of interesting things, including works by 19th-century landscape painters like Edward Bannister and Henry Tanner; Harlem Renaissance artists like Aaron Douglas and Hale Woodruff; modernists like Romare Beardon and Norman Lewis; and postmodernists like Danny Simmons and Carrie Mae Weems. The Puck Building, 295 Lafayette Street, at Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 925-5257, through Sunday. Hours: Today, noon to 8 p.m.; tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $15; students, $10. (Ken Johnson) Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and Icon,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045. (Holland Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average lifespan was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness was a shot in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) * New York Public Library: 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS,' through Feb. 12. Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069. (Smith) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) * P.S. 1: 'The Painted World,' through March 13. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. (See above.) (Johnson) The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through April 16. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray, and artworks in various media relating to chess by Dorothea Tanning, Alberto Giacometti and John Cage, whose chessboard incorporates musical notation for a piano composition that you can hear on headphones. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Johnson) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century., right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. Too, he was a superb colorist, assigning psychological properties to each color, red in particular, which he considered symbolic of power and energy. Among the best works here are his last ones, landscapes that have the magic of Expressionist theater, with houses, trees and the like assuming almost human presences. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) (Johnson) Galleries: Uptown The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter) Galleries: 57th Street * Maria Elena González This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. González encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter) * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea MIKE CLOUD Mike Cloud is a young artist of the moment, with a project exhibition at P.S. 1, photo-collages in ''Frequency'' at the Studio Museum in Harlem, and new paintings in a solo at Protetch. The work, and his Protetch show in particular, is a tough nut to crack. But rude, funny and meaty, it's well worth the attempt. Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6999, through Feb. 11. (Cotter) ORI GERSHT: 'THE FOREST' This briefly mesmerizing film consists of silent, panning shots of immense trees interrupted at intervals by the sight and sound of one of them falling violently and slowly to the ground. The mood is somber, even tragic, but in the end, too easily won. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766; through Feb 11. (Smith) * Warren Isensee Could this be Mr. Isensee's breakout show? His glowing grid, striped and concentric rectangle paintings play adroitly with conventions of Modernist abstraction and are almost hallucinogenically beautiful. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, (212) 223-2227, through Feb. 11. (Johnson) ERWIN OLAF The large, carefully staged photographs of people in midcentury American clothes and environments by this successful Dutch commercial photographer look like the dreams of a deeply depressed Norman Rockwell. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) ROXY PAINE The main attraction of this extraordinarily inventive sculptor's show is a computer-controlled sandblaster that is slowly sculpturing a piece of sandstone into something resembling a topographical model of a Southwestern landscape. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) AMY RATHBONE: 'UNBENT' Operating somewhere between Richard Tuttle and Ree Morton, this artist embeds wires of different lengths and colors in the wall to create whiskery textures, clustered hoops or trailing lines. The resulting wall drawings are endearing, if a bit too close to abstract New Yorker cartoons. Priska C. Juschka Fine Art, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-4320; through Feb. 11. (Smith) Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Feb. 11. (Johnson) Other Galleries JOHN BRATTIN: 'THE TRIUMPH OF NIGHT' John Brattin's short film ''The Triumph of Night'' is like a basement-tapes version of ''Wuthering Heights.'' Written and directed by Mr. Brattin, its title lifted from a book of Edith Wharton ghost stories, it delivers a Hollywood-ready Victorian plot in an ingeniously homespun package. Participant Inc., 95 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 254-4334, through Feb. 12. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty Downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu, and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her death bed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot-tall weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) *'DAVID HAMMONS: THE AUTHORIZED RETROSPECTIVE' How do you do a show if you don't have art? Use copies. How do you get copies? Find photographs of the original art. That's what Triple Candie has done with David Hammons's work. The gallery photocopied illustrations of existing, or once existing, Hammons pieces from books and magazines and downloaded others from the Internet. They then taped the 8 1/2 -by-11 prints to the gallery wall. The result: an homage that is very much in this important artist's maverick, dematerialized spirit. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783, through Feb. 12.(Cotter) Last Chance * 'Constructing Realities' See this conceptually ambitious exhibition for Andy Warhol's amazing, rarely seen 1965 film of an 83-year-old performer named Paul Swan who dances and recites poetry in exotic, Middle Eastern-style costumes with wonderfully un-self-conscious verve. A one-act play on video by Mike Kelley; videos transmitted from cellphones for a project by Robert Whitman; a multiscreen video portrait of a man by Gary Hill; Stan Douglas's well-known film ''Der Sandemann''; and a selection of classic Diane Arbus photographs round out the show. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 421-3293; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * Katy Grannan: 'Mystic Lake' Ms. Grannan makes exceptionally intimate photographs of nonprofessional models posing outdoors partly or fully unclothed. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) Kim Levin: 'Notes and Itineraries, 1976 - 2004' The longtime art critic for The Village Voice is the subject of a fascinating retrospective that views her career, as well as the history of the New York art scene, through the lens of ephemera that she has accumulated over the past 25 years, including postcard announcements, news releases and handwritten exhibition lists. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3232; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION' With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' (A complete retrospective of Pixar animated films concludes with ''The Incredibles'' (2004), the Oscar-winning story of the Parr family, superheroes trying not to be so super.) In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as those films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; closes Monday. (Smith) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE' For 40 years, Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above); closes Sunday. (Kimmelman)",

Eero Saarinen's Pedestal table, designed for Knoll in the mid-1950's, is one of them. It's elegant but not pretentious, giving it the ability to blend into any dining room. Like its companion, the iconic Pedestal chair (also known as the Tulip chair), the table -- with its sweeping base of synthetic-coated aluminum -- was Saarinen's attempt at clearing up ''the slum of legs'' that he felt plagued most interiors. It's a graceful solution, although not without its drawbacks: because the base has so much surface area, it requires constant dusting. But that seems like a small price to pay for the pleasure of the table's company. It first appeared in my life when I was an adolescent and my father bought one, with six chairs, from an architect friend for his office conference room. My parents hadn't owned anything modernist since the early years of their marriage, so the Saarinen seemed especially groovy. Later, it became my parents' informal dining table, and while ridding its white laminate top of the ink from breakfast newspapers was a minor annoyance, there was something quite satisfying about a table that came with swivel chairs. Sometimes there's nothing like a good spin after a meal. Today, the table has moved into my father's home office, and I miss it. A few years ago, in a fit of nostalgia, I went to the annual Knoll sale and bought a Saarinen side table with a marble top for my apartment. I thought it would provide a nice contrast to the mostly traditional upholstered furniture in my living room. It did, indeed, so why wasn't I happy with it? The answer came to me only recently: you can't eat breakfast or read the paper at a side table. Time to trade up. Pilar Viladas",2005/11/06

Q. What's it like for Palm watching this long-running legal drama involving R.I.M.? A. The one thing that we can continue to be focused on is competing in the marketplace, and certainly this may bring some uncertainty to R.I.M.'s customers and they may be more interested in looking at some of our solutions. But I don't think -- my sense is that ultimately it will be resolved between the parties and I think the idea that the BlackBerry service will be discontinued is extremely unlikely. Q. There is a perception out there that a recent court ruling, which refused to impose a settlement between R.I.M. and the patent holding company, NTP, is good news for you. Your stock went up on the news and a lot of people see this as an opportunity for Palm to grab even more market share of corporate customers. A.

High-powered career, loving husband, contented family, hot sex life -- a heady combo not as easy to secure as it is to slap phrases on the cover of magazines. But arguments against the cheery ethos espoused by Ms. Brown can be traced back further than you might think. Another tri-named celebrity and polemicist, George Bernard Shaw, wrote a cautionary tale about a successful career woman facing a family meltdown more than a century ago. ''Mrs. Warren's Profession,'' written in 1893 and first staged in the United States in 1905, was deemed scandalous for its teasing arguments that prostitution was a business no more or less exploitative than others in Victorian England, no more morally compromising than most marriages.",2005/12/19

British police officers investigating the theft of ''Reclining Figure,'' right, a two-ton Henry Moore sculpture valued at $5.2 million, from the artist's estate 30 miles north of London have recovered the flatbed truck and crane believed to have been used in the crime, but they expressed fear that the bronze might be melted for scrap, The Associated Press and the BBC reported. Chief Inspector Richard Harbon of the Hertfordshire police characterized the sculpture as ''a national treasure'' that would be ''very, very difficult to get rid of.'' He said, ''So, obviously, we are looking at all the possibilities, right from scrap metal up to fine arts theft.'' Created in 1969-70, the statue by Moore (1898-1986), one of the pre-eminent sculptors of the 20th century, was stolen on Thursday night from Perry Green, the 70-acre estate and studios that he established, endowed and left to his foundation. The thieves, two vehicles and the crane were seen on closed-circuit television. Wyeth's 'Helga' Art Is Sold The 240-piece ''Helga'' collection of art by Andrew Wyeth, which caused a sensation when its existence was revealed in 1986, has been sold and is no longer in the custody of the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, Pa., The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Created from 1971 to 1985, the paintings, watercolors and pencil studies, some of them nudes, used as a model Helga Testorf, a Wyeth neighbor in Chadds Ford, and were unknown even to Mr. Wyeth's wife, Betsy. In 1986, Wyeth, now 88, sold the art to Leonard E. B. Andrews, a Pennsylvania businessman and art collector, who resold it to an anonymous Japanese collector in 1989 for $40 million to $45 million. The collection was entrusted to the Brandywine River Museum, home to a collection of art by three generations of Wyeths. The latest sale was handled by Ann Richards Nitze, a Washington dealer, who declined to identify the buyer or specify the price, The Inquirer said. 'Scream' Theft Trial Is Scheduled Accused of stealing the unrecovered Edvard Munch masterworks ''The Scream'' and ''Madonna,'' six people are to stand trial next month in Oslo, Reuters reported. Terje Nyboe, a prosecutor, announced yesterday that five people had been charged with taking part in the robbery at the Munch Museum in Oslo on Aug. 22, 2004, and a sixth has been charged with receiving stolen goods. The 1893 paintings, wrenched from the wall by two masked gunmen as terrified museumgoers looked on, have not been seen since the thieves sped off in a car driven by a third man and then switched to another getaway car. Three of the six defendants are in police custody. In keeping with Norwegian practice, their names were not released. They face maximum prison terms of 17 years if convicted. A Kiss Is Not Just a Kiss The Hershey Company is suing Simon & Schuster over the chocolate bar and other images pictured on the dust jacket of a new book about Hershey's founder, The Associated Press reported. The company wants an injunction to prevent the publisher from using Hershey-owned images to market ''Hershey: Milton S. Hershey's Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire and Utopian Dreams,'' by Michael D'Antonio, due out next month. A Hershey spokeswoman, Stephanie Moritz, said the company was concerned that consumers may think it ''authorized, sponsored or approved'' the book. ''Hershey does not object to the content of defendant's book, or to the mere use of the word 'Hershey' in the title of the book,'' according to the federal lawsuit, which was made public yesterday. ''However, defendant has designed and adopted a dust jacket for the book which extensively uses Hershey's well-known marks and trade dress beyond any manner permissible under law.'' The jacket also depicts a Hershey's Kiss; a subtitle in a font similar to the paper wrapper inside a Kiss; and two older Hershey advertising images. Alexis Welby, a Simon & Schuster publicist, had no immediate comment. New Portrait of Elizabeth II An impressionistic portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by a 75-year-old Australian entertainer commissioned to commemorate her 80th birthday, on April 21, goes on view today in the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace, Agence France-Presse reported. The artist, Rolf Harris, above with the portrait, said he was thrilled with the results but admitted that he had to ''muck about'' at first with his image of the monarch's teeth and that his first version of the painting ''sort of looked like a pork butcher from Norwich.'' He continued, ''It didn't look anything like the queen at all.'' The BBC reported that one newspaper described the image of the queen as ''blurred'' with ''unflattering heavy features.''

Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales was questioned by, among others, Senators Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. The statements were recorded by the Federal News Service Inc. MR. SPECTER Why not take your entire program to the FISA court within the broad parameters of what is reasonable and constitutional and ask the FISA court to approve it or disapprove it? MR. GONZALES Senator, I totally agree with you that the FISA court should be commended for its great service. They are working on weekends; they're working at night -- -- MR. SPECTER Now, on to my question. MR. GONZALES They're assisting in the war on terror. In terms of why not go to the FISA court, once the determination was made that neither the Constitution nor FISA prohibited the use of this tool, then the question becomes for the commander in chief which of the tools is appropriate given a particular circumstance. And we studied very carefully the requirements of the Constitution under the Fourth Amendment, we studied very carefully what FISA provides for. As I said in my statement, we believe that FISA does anticipate that another statute could permit electronic surveillance -- -- MR. SPECTER O.K., you think you're right, but there are a lot of people who think you're wrong. As a matter of public confidence, why not take it to the FISA court? What do you have to lose if you're right? MR. GONZALES What I can say, Senator, is that we are continually looking at ways that we can work with the FISA court in being more efficient and more effective in fighting the war on terror. Obviously, we would consider, and are always considering, methods of fighting the war effectively against Al Qaeda. MR. SPECTER Well, speaking for myself, I would urge the president to take this matter to the FISA court. They're experts. They'll maintain the secrecy. And let's see what they have to say. . . . MR. LEAHY Let me ask you this. Under your interpretation of this, can you go in and do mail searches? Can you go into e-mails? Can you open mail? Can you do ''black bag'' jobs? MR. GONZALES Sir -- -- MR. LEAHY And under the idea that you don't have much time to go through what you described as a cumbersome procedure -- what most people think is a pretty easy procedure -- to get a FISA warrant, can you go and do that?

And I'm not going to get into a discussion, Senator, about hypotheticals. MR. LEAHY Mr. Attorney General, you're not answering my question. I'm not asking you what the president authorized. You're the chief law enforcement officer of the country. Does this law authorize the opening of first-class mail of U.S. citizens -- yes or no -- under your interpretation? MR.

Among the speakers were Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine; Michael D. Brown, the former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota. A complete transcript is at nytimes.com/national. SENATOR COLLINS: D.H.S. officials tell us that they did not know of the severity of the situation in New Orleans until Tuesday morning. That's almost 24 hours after you received the information that I referred to about the severe flooding in New Orleans. They also assert that they believe you failed to make sure that they were getting this very critical information. I'd like you to respond to that criticism. MR. BROWN: First and foremost, I find it a little disingenuous that D.H.S. would claim that they were not getting that information, because FEMA held continuous video telephone conferences -- I'll refer to them as V.T.C.'s -- in which at least once a day, if not several times a day, we would be on conference calls and video calls to make certain that everyone had situational awareness. Now, I'm sitting in Baton Rouge, so I'm not sure at all times who is on the video conference, on the V.T.C., but the record indicates that on numerous occasions, at least Deputy Secretary Jackson and at least Matthew Broderick or Bob Stephans, someone from the H.S.O.C. -- the Homeland Security Operations Center -- is in on those conversations on those V.T.C.'s. So for them to now claim that we didn't have awareness of it, I think, is just baloney. SENATOR COLLINS: Can you help us understand this enormous disconnect between what was happening on the ground -- a city 80 percent flooded, uncontrolled levees, people dying, people waiting to be rescued -- and the official reaction among many of the key leaders in Washington and in Northern Command that somehow New Orleans had dodged the bullet? MR. BROWN: It's my belief that had there been a report come out from Marty Bahamonde that said, yes, we've confirmed that a terrorist has blown up the 17th Street Canal Levee, then everybody would have jumped all over that and been trying to do everything they could; but because this was a natural disaster, that has become the stepchild within the Department of Homeland Security, and so you now have these two systems operating -- one which cares about terrorism, and FEMA and our state and local partners, who are trying to approach everything from all hazards. SENATOR COLEMAN: I understand some of the concerns that have been raised about the function of D.H.S. and the integration of FEMA. But as I listen to your testimony, it's -- you're not prepared to kind of put a mirror in front of your face and recognize your own inadequacies and say: ''You know something, I made some big mistakes. I wasn't focused. I didn't get things done.'' And instead, what you got is: ''I was -- I was -- you know, the problems are structural, I knew it up front. I really tried to change it.'' The record, the entirety of the record doesn't reflect that. And perhaps you may get a more sympathetic hearing if you had a willingness to kind of confess your own sins in this. And, you know -- you know, your testimony here is that you're going to communicate to the president as to what he understood. I'm not sure what you understood. I'm not sure you got it. And I got to tell you, the record -- not FEMA's, but the record reflects that you didn't get it or you didn't in writing or in some way make commands that would move people to do what has to be done until way after it should have been done. MR. BROWN: Senator, with all due respect, what do you want me to say? I have admitted to mistakes publicly. I've admitted to mistakes in hearings. What more, Senator Coleman, do you want from me?",2006/02/11

Schwartz, a grocer's son from the Bronx who had acquired a serviceable education hanging around pool halls and racetracks, gave his boyhood friend Calvin Klein $10,000 to start a coat business. Since then, hundreds of designers, when faced with the terrible odds of going solo in the fashion business, have said to themselves, ''What I need is a Barry Schwartz.'' A Schwartz at your back was proof against shutdown, a guarantee of unending loyalty. Three years ago, Klein and Schwartz sold Calvin Klein Inc. to Phillips-Van Heusen in a deal worth about $730 million. Klein has kept a hand in the company's advertising. He also travels a lot; Brazil is apparently a favorite destination. Schwartz, a gambler at bottom, devotes himself to his horse-racing operations, a sideline developed in the first gold-rush days of designer denim and underwear. Horses bred on his 741-acre farm in Westchester County run at the country's top tracks, and Schwartz stepped down as the chairman of the New York Racing Association at the end of 2004. Although Wall Street was skeptical that Phillips-Van Heusen could manage a designer label -- it was better known for brands like Izod and Bass -- Calvin Klein has apparently thrived under PVH. Its runway collections, by Klein's chosen successor, Francisco Costa, have received some of the best reviews in the company's history, and PVH's stock price has risen from $11.50 in January 2003 to nearly $37 as of mid-January.",2006/02/26

Who is to blame for telephone service being out so long after Katrina hit? A. There's probably nobody who looks particularly good in the Katrina situation, with the possible exception of the military when they were allowed to act. Q. Should we build redundant networks so disasters don't knock out communications? A. I don't think so. In Katrina and most particularly in the tsunami, everything that was physically there was swept away. I doubt that we are going to be able to harden these things in enough locations so that it makes a difference, given the unpredictability of disasters. Rather, I think the answer is response and resilience in the network capability. Q. How could we have faster communications recoveries? A. There are two parts of the issue.

Realizing some aspect of the dream that was the failed AOL Time Warner merger, the network offers an inventory of dramas, comedies and ''vintage'' programming from the Warner Brothers archive, proving perhaps, as the fashion world has already demonstrated, that ''vintage'' in modern parlance has simply come to mean old. AOL Television, or In2TV as it is called, allows viewers to click on episodes from a long list of series and watch free. The focus is on programming either no longer (or infrequently) in syndication and in some cases unavailable on DVD. The effect is a kind of diminishing of the Warner Brothers brand because if you have typically thought of Warner Brothers as the purveyor of classic cartoons or the production apparatus that brought us ''Friends,'' you will now think of it as the engine of ''F Troop'' and ''Growing Pains'' (each, as it happens, classified as vintage).",2006/03/24

Red wine glasses were still in the sink from the previous night's dinner party for a group that she and her husband, Ravenel Boykin Curry IV, had convened to hash out an arts program for their ''creative utopia.'' They are developing a planned community in the Dominican Republic that will provide weekend succor to investors like Fareed Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International; Bronson Van Wyck, the event planner; Moby, the musician and tea shop owner; and other wealthy bohemians with an appetite for current affairs and social causes served up in a tropical paradise. Mr. Curry, a money manager and education reform advocate, and Ms. Kemble have been collecting folks like these in their Central Park South apartment for some years now, building an unlikely salon and quasi-liberal brain-and-money trust floating high above the gilt and marble of Trump Parc.",2006/04/06

No bloody bodies are dismembered and no cats are harmed in the course of this new play by Karoline Leach, making it a safe option for the ''Inishmore''-skittish crowds. Ms. Leach's tale of an unlikely, and possibly dangerous, romance in Edwardian England has some active assets, too.

As Erlbaum learns, problems don't go away -- even when you do. A furniture-breaking, leering stepfather drove 15-year-old Erlbaum out of her home and into a Hell's Kitchen shelter. There, she writes, she was called ''white bitch'' and singled out for more abuse. One occupant, Sherri, heavily pregnant and furious (''When the nuns weren't looking, she'd take a flying leap at the arm of the sofa or smash her belly into the stair banister''), charged her with a small knife. Erlbaum, now a columnist for Bust magazine, describes the failures of a system designed to help young people: shelter residents were one missed curfew away from being thrown on the streets -- where, she discovered, you might end up, as one girl did, ''hanging around the men's bathroom at the Port Authority with some pit-faced guy in zebra-striped weight lifter's pants.'' At a group home on the Upper West Side, she was threatened with ''Treatment,'' which sometimes involved wearing a sign (for example, one that said baby) around your neck. School ''functioned mostly as a clearinghouse for drumming up drugs, sex or shelter.'' At one point she worried, needlessly, that people thought she was ''a Goody Two-Shoes.'' ''Not at all,'' a friend assured her. ''Maybe, like, a Slutty Two-Shoes.'' Erlbaum was hard to help. And everywhere she went, adults failed her: counselors seemed psychotic; teachers were indifferent; her mom floundered. How satisfying to watch Erlbaum survive adolescence and produce a smart, engaging book -- ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Pothead,'' you might say -- that indicts those who wronged her yet never dissolves into tears or tantrums. Eventually, she did what many adults never manage: she grew up.",2006/04/09

Prison breaks, on the other hand, are most satisfying when offset by the possibility of last-minute reprieve, preferably by a phone call from the governor. One reason ''Prison Break'' on Fox is so much fun to watch is that it mixes the classic elements of both genres: wartime camaraderie and the long walk to the electric chair. That virtue is also the series' biggest flaw. Fox wants viewers to root for the convicts the way they would for allied soldiers in ''The Great Escape'' or ''Stalag 17'' and accordingly paints them all as either innocent or, at worst, only a little guilty. The creators of ''Prison Break'' even went so far as to make one inmate an Iraq war veteran who was set up by his superior officer after he tried to report incidents of prisoner abuse; the veteran drifted into crime back home because he couldn't find an honest job after his dishonorable (and unjust) discharge.",2006/04/10

''The land is fertile, partly wooded and well watered,'' Mr. Thomson wrote in a sale notice for his land and buildings in 1825. Within a few years, the land was acquired for $20,500 by one of John Jacob Astor's sons, those downtown scions who understood that the city would soon stretch north and make them even richer than they were.
