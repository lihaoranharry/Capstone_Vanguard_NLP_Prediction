Passed away on August 23, 2012, at 76 years of age, at home in Berkeley, CA, USA with her husband and family and caregivers, after a long and difficult illness with Parkinson's Disease, and having received the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick by Fr. Bruno Gibson, OP. Surviving are her husband Ronald, and her children Christopher, Peter and Hans, her brother Harris Steiner, her daughters-in-law: Mary, Jennifer, and Anessa, her beloved grandchildren Katharine, Eric and Soren, Alexandra Ruth (in utero), and her nieces Laura Durbahn of Kerman, CA, Cynthia Ganz of Seattle, Elise Winter of Loomis, CA., nephew Carl Steiner of San Diego, and grandnieces and grandnephews. Ruth will be greatly missed by her dear friends: sorority sister and fellow teacher Celia Gunn Ginnado of Arlington Heights, Ill., Sra. Imelda Espiritu of Berkeley, and Christina Ahengua of Richmond. And also her classmates and friends from The Sigma Kappa sorority at UC Berkeley, and her classmates from Kerman HS., the parishioners and teachers at School of the Madeleine, and at St. Mary's College HS. A proud native of California, she was born at St. Agnes Hospital in Fresno. She graduated from Kerman HS with honors, Cheerleader, Girls Athletic Association and Tennis Team letters, International Quill and Scroll Society for Journalism, and a California Scholarship Federation (CSF) Member. The daughter of Thelma Harris Steiner, a California school teacher, and Rene Steiner, a Kerman raisin grower and RFD mailman. Ruth was a member of the The Order of Rainbow for Girls, and a California Raisin Queen. She was a 5-year 4H Achievement Award winner. Following her brother Harris's example, Ruth matriculated at UC Berkeley in 1953 and joined the Sigma Kappa sorority. Walking to class one day in her first year, she met her husband-to-be, and they began an odyssey for life. Ruth as: teacher, then through the active years of raising her boys, as an interior designer and her designs include offices and living areas for the Christian Brothers-De La Salle Institute Winery (her leaded glass door panels bearing the CB seal are still in use at the Sutter Home Winery in St. Helena, CA.) For nearly six years she was national sale representative for her partnership in the Abundance Winery in Sonoma. In the latter role she was thrilled to encounter a former member of her son's class at the Madeleine - he was a competitor salesman at a dealer in Chicago. He afterward joked of losing that sale, as it was unfair to have to compete against ""a Mom with all that charm."" Meantime, she completed her studies at UC, graduating BA as an UC Alumni Scholar in the same ceremony with Ron gaining his JD. Now all of the Larsons were Cal Bears. Ruth was active in the School of the Madeleine at their family parish: re-founding the Bridge Club, leading the Cub's Scouts, and singing in Father Larry's choir. The boys went on to the St. Mary's College High School where she helped the Brothers of the Christian Schools, Eunice Jackson and other mothers, found the Belles of St. Mary's as a scholarship organization for the school. She didn't know ""slow."" She spent her days and nights teaching, counseling, feeding and loving her family, gardening, playing the piano at midnite home sessions, dancing at the Parish parties, traveling with Ron, skiing with the boys, and as a member of the Art Deco Society of San Francisco. Always a lady: raised by her Convent trained mother, she was initiated in 1953, by her new friend on Milvia Street, Pat Sager, to wear gloves and scarf and hat and take lunch at the City of Paris. A propriety she must have been one of the last to relinquish. But she wore her scarves and gloves until the day she died. All Services will be at the St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church 2005 Berryman St, Berkeley, California 94709 (510-526-4811) as follows: Thursday, September 6th at 7PM - The Holy Rosary of the Virgin Mary; Friday, September 7th at 10:30AM - Mass - followed immediately by reception and refreshments in Norton Hall (directly under the Church - entry from the parking lot).

(BBC America) MISTRESSES This soap opera about four women in Bristol, England, balancing friendship and extramarital intrigue, left American viewers dangling when Season 2 wrapped in May 2009. Now it returns for a four-episode finale. When last we saw the girlfriends, Katie (Sarah Parish), the doctor who helped her terminally ill married lover commit suicide in Season 1 (and then went on to have an affair with his son and then with an old, also-married flame), was about to find out if her latest beau would sweep her off to Australia in an act of forgiveness. Trudi (Sharon Small), who thought her husband had died in the terror attacks of Sept. 11 and discovered that he was in fact still alive, had gotten married to a man who also wasn't what he seemed. Jessica (Shelley Conn, above), a pregnant event planner in an open marriage, learned that her spouse had decided to be monogamous. Or so he said. And Siobhan (Orla Brady) was relegated to single-mother status after struggling with infertility in her marriage, then getting pregnant by a colleague -- which sent her husband packing. In this Season 3 premiere the women are summoned to Katie's house, where their icy demeanor suggests that they are friends no more. Joanna Lumley joins the cast as Vivienne, Katie's imperious mother. 1 P.M. (HBO Signature) SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE (2003) In this double bill from the director Nancy Meyers, a music executive in his 60s (Jack Nicholson) with a fondness for young women finds the rug pulled out from under him when he falls for the mother (Diane Keaton, above) of a woman he's dating (Amanda Peet). Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that Mr. Nicholson and Ms. Keaton sparred ''with the freedom of professionals with nothing left to prove, and Mr. Nicholson has the gentlemanly grace to step aside and let Ms. Keaton claim the movie.'' He added, ''She in turn brings out the best in everyone around her.'' At 3:15, in ''It's Complicated,'' Meryl Streep plays Jane Adler, a successful California restaurateur who is about to settle into life as an empty nester when she is blindsided by advances from her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin), who had left her a decade earlier for a pretty young thing (Lake Bell). Steve Martin is thrown into the mix as the architect overseeing the renovation of Jane's house, and he is not without his own charms. The truth, Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times, is ''that everyone needs a little coddling, which could be the key to Ms. Meyers's peculiar talent: She pampers her audience shamelessly.''"

On Sunday, several leading Republicans — including Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona, both of whom are members of the Armed Services Committee — used appearances on television talk shows to warn that failure to intervene in Syria would embolden nations like Iran and North Korea."

(13, 49) KANGAROO MOB In the last 50 years, the population of eastern gray kangaroos around Canberra, the capital of Australia, has multiplied from a few hundred to tens of thousands. Forced to search for food beyond the city's drought-stricken hills, the hungry creatures have moved into urban territory, dining on parkland and lawns -- and dying by the thousands in run-ins with cars. That has led the government to reduce herds through extermination, prompting an emotional backlash. This ''Nature'' episode follows a gang of street-wise kangaroos to reveal how they survive in the city. Among them are Black Spot, above, at more than 6 feet tall the mob's dominant male and the father of most of the joeys in his group, and Madge, who teaches her son Sonny about survival among humans while carrying a nursing joey named Alice in her pouch.

''Their Cinderella Man is the decent little guy who affirms what movie people call the triumph of the human spirit,'' she wrote. ''The story Mr. Crowe tells, with Mr. Giamatti as a gleeful Mephistopheles, is that of a man who, having sampled the blood of others, clearly enjoyed the taste.''"

''Ms. Johansson is photographed so that her skin is as opalescent as her earring, but the movie is opaque,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. ''It is an earnest, obvious melodrama with no soul, filled with the longing silences that come after a sigh.''

(Sho2) THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA (2010) The histories of Shea Stadium, the Mets, Billy Joel (below) and New York City itself across four and a half decades intersect in this documentary from Paul Crowder, which focuses on Mr. Joel's concerts on July 16 and July 18, 2008 -- the last performances given in the stadium, which was torn down the next year. ''For the July 18 concert,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, Paul McCartney ''miraculously appeared, having been whisked through customs at Kennedy International Airport after a flight from London that had been allowed to land early. He was sped to the stadium by a motorcade in 11 minutes and driven onto the field in time to perform by Pete Flynn, the dedicated groundskeeper who had driven the Beatles to the same stage 43 years earlier.'' Mr. Holden added: '' 'If it weren't for the Beatles,' Mr. Joel declares, 'I wouldn't do what I do.' Call it perfect symmetry. The final number, 'Let It Be,' rings as a sweet valedictory to all the struggle, the teamwork and the glory captured in this wonderful film.'' In the film ''The Love We Make'' (2011), at 11 on Showtime, Albert Maysles, Bradley Kaplan and Ian Markiewicz capture Mr. McCartney's experiences in New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and his performance the next month with Elton John, Mr. Joel and David Bowie in the ''Concert for New York City'' at Madison Square Garden. Mr. McCartney had been on the runway at Kennedy when the attacks occurred."

Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called this film, which features appearances by Julianne Moore, Diane von Furstenberg, Isaac Mizrahi and Michael Musto, ''a touching, elegiac tale of the rise (and some would say fall) of a colorful New York neighborhood under the relentless march of gentrification.'' 9 A.M.

(Showtime) THE HELP (2011) Skeeter (Emma Stone), an aspiring writer from a prominent family in early 1960s Mississippi, causes an uproar in her community when she interviews black female servants in this adaptation of the Kathryn Stockett novel, directed and written by Tate Taylor. Viola Davis earned a best actress Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Aibileen, a maid who has raised several of the town's white babies. Octavia Spencer (above right, with Ms. Davis) won for best supporting actress as Aibileen's best friend, Minny, who endures soul-killing work for Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard), a housewife who believes in white superiority. And Cicely Tyson is Constantine, the woman who raised Skeeter -- and who inspires her former charge's journey of discovery. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called this best picture nominee a ''big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum.'' The movie's ''vision of a divided America that while consistently insulting and sometimes even terrifying, is rarely grotesque, despite Hilly's best (worst) segregationist efforts,'' she added. ''Inside all these different homes, black and white women tend to the urgent matters of everyday life, like the care and feeding of children. And while every so often the roar of the outside world steals in like thunder, Mr. Taylor makes sure it doesn't rattle the china or your soul.'' 8 P.M. (HBO) SOMETHING BORROWED (2011) Ginnifer Goodwin stars as Rachel, a New York lawyer who imagines herself a wallflower until, on her 30th birthday, she finally ends up in bed with her longtime crush, Dex (Colin Egglesfield). Kate Hudson is Darcy, a brassy blond bombshell and Rachel's lifelong best friend -- and the woman Dex happens to be engaged to. ''The contrast between Darcy and Rachel is a bit overdrawn, but it should have given the conflict between them at least a hint of comic snap,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times about this film, adapted by Luke Greenfield from the novel by Emily Giffin. ''And the premise should have been a surefire recipe for farce, especially when everyone piles into a summer share in the Hamptons.'' Why this film ''should be so cautious and tepid,'' Mr. Scott said, ''is a puzzle.''"

Craig, a former Republican senator from Idaho who was caught in an undercover sex sting; and two former United States congressmen, Anthony Weiner of New York, who resigned over lewd online behavior, and Mark Foley of Florida, who resigned after he was caught sending sexually explicit texts to teenage Capitol Hill pages.

In 1952 Mike hired a 22-year old conductor for a nationwide Gershwin concert tour that ran for two seasons (1952-54) and played in 170 cities. His name: Lorin Maazel. It was the only orchestra in history dedicated exclusively to the music of one composer. Mike pursued his interest in George Gershwin in collaboration with Michael Feinstein. Mike, a well-known producer of shows for large corporations (IBM, Coca Cola, CBS, AT&T) hired star performers such as Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett, Liza Minnelli, Diahann Carroll, Leslie Huggams, Lena Horne, Bob Hope, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Bolger, Doc Severinsen and Bill Cosby among others. Memorable productions Mike presented include The Royal Danish Ballet in its US debut and The Conservatory Without Walls, a glittering event in honor of the country's greatest Afro-American musicians which launched the Duke Ellington Fellowship Fund at Yale University. Mike also served on the board of The Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance. Mike Lanin was born in Philadelphia on March, 8, 1924, the son of the band leader Howard Lanin and the nephew of Lester Lanin, the internationally known society band leader. During World War II he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps. At that time he discovered a young and talented pianist, still unknown, Bobby Short. They became friends for the rest of their lives. Mike was a graduate of Yale University where he was an imaginative caricaturist for the Yale Record. He is also remembered for his fond portrayal of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. Mike was an elegant man both in appearance and in spirit. He was always courteous, soft spoken, never one to boast of his many achievements and of his friendships with famous artists. He was a loyal friend, a witty but considerate companion with a dry sense of humor. He was an entertaining guest. Mike has been called ""the dean of entertainment who pioneered the theme party, the pops concert, the anniversary revue and the multimedia production."" He was an avid reader and traveler. He kept homes in New York and Paris. He is survived by his wife of 45 years, the love of his life, Yvonne Constant-Lanin, a performer herself and a frequent guest (45 times) on the Johnny Carson Show. It was always a pleasure to see how much Mike enjoyed his wife's performances. He was proud of her interpretations of French and American songs. At her recitals he would greet friends with a radiant smile. He was also proud of Yvonne having been named ""Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres"", an important French cultural award.

Eventually he approaches the property's owner (Nana Patekar, above right, with Mr. Chavan) and becomes his assistant; the rich man, in turn, promises to become Venkatesh's benefactor if he will move from Goa to Mumbai and go to school. ''At first 'The Pool' suggests an inspirational fable in which a selfless older man rescues a youth from the streets,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this film by Chris Smith, adapted from a short story by Randy Russell. ''But just when you expect the film to turn into a predictable, rose-colored valentine to opportunity and hope, it goes to a deeper, more ambiguous place. Contemplating poverty from Venkatesh's perspective, it understands that his pursuit of upward mobility will require a terrifying leap of faith.'' The film was chosen as a New York Times Critics' Pick.

He finds something to live for after his ex-wife leaves their 11-year-old daughter (Elle Fanning, right, with Mr. Dorff) in his care. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott described the movie as ''exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious.'' What happens, he added, ''is something marvelous: a film that never raises its voice (its loudest and most assertive sound is that Ferrari) or panders to your emotions, but that nonetheless has the power to refresh your perceptions and deepen your sympathies.''

She was interviewed by Dan Rather on CBS 60 Minutes II, and by others on television, on the topic of the Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco International Ltd. trial, in which she was involved as the sole ""hold out"" juror against conviction. She advocated that as there was not sufficient evidence in the initial trial to establish the defendant's guilt, as she saw it, the presumption of innocence must prevail. Rudy was an optimist and an idealist; a person of great fortitude and original thought. Always supportive of her children and grandchildren, and an extremely warm and devoted mother, she set an example of determination and creative solutions in the face of adversity.

(ABC) THE 84TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS The tried-and-true Billy Crystal returns for his ninth stint as host of this ceremony broadcast live from the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles (above, setting the scene). George Clooney is up for best actor for ''The Descendants,'' but oddsmakers are predicting that Jean Dujardin will take home the Oscar for his role as a silent-movie star in ''The Artist,'' the black-and-white tribute to a golden age in Hollywood. That film is expected to win best picture as well, while its director, Michel Hazanavicius, is favored for the directing award. Viola Davis is the top best-actress contender for her turn as a courageous maid in ''The Help,'' though Meryl Streep, as Margaret Thatcher in ''The Iron Lady,'' could make it a close race. And in the best-supporting category, Christopher Plummer is expected to win as a father who comes out of the closet near the end of his life in ''Beginners,'' as is Octavia Spencer, who portrayed another determined maid in ''The Help.'' ''A Separation,'' the domestic drama set in Iran, is favored to win for best foreign film. The countdown begins at 1:30 on E!; at 4 on the TV Guide Channel; and at 6 on Channel 11. Tim Gunn, Robin Roberts, Jess Cagle, Nina Garcia and Louise Roe interview celebrities on the red carpet at 7 on ABC. Postshow coverage follows at 11:30 on E! 7 A.M. (Sho2) THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) Colin Firth, below, in the role for which he won the best-actor Oscar last year, portrays Albert Frederick Arthur George, or Bertie, as his family called him, the shy second son of George V of Britain (Michael Gambon) in this film from Tom Hooper. Geoffrey Rush is Lionel Logue, the speech therapist who helps him conquer his debilitating stutter. And Helena Bonham Carter is Elizabeth, Bertie's wife and staunch support system, who can't quite stomach Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), the American divorcée who leads Bertie's older brother, David (Guy Pearce), to abdicate as Edward VIII. ''It isn't exactly 'Pygmalion,' not least because Mr. Hooper has no intention of satirizing the caste system that is one of this movie's biggest draws,'' Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, said of the film, which received 12 nominations and earned Mr. Hooper an Oscar as best director. ''Like many entertainments of this pop-historical type, 'The King's Speech' wears history lightly no matter how heavy the crown.'' The film also won Academy Awards for best picture and original screenplay (David Seidler)."

Known as Rudy, she was born on September 11, 1924 in Chicago, one of five daughters of James Ewing Bennett and Mary Mable Dwyer. She attended the Girls' Latin School in Chicago and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College with a B.A. in 1946. Rudy served as a volunteer ambulance driver for the Red Cross Motor Corps in Chicago during World War II. She volunteered as a nurse's aide during and after college. A long term member of The Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York, New York, and St. John's Episcopal Church, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, Rudy was a person of strong values and a leader in ethics. Rudy studied at Columbia University Teacher's College towards a Master's degree in Teaching and taught English and American History for 10 years at The Lenox School in Manhattan. She subsequently earned her Juris Doctor from New York Law School in 1981, and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1982 at the age of 57. She worked as an assistant in the Law Department at the New York County Surrogate's Court, and later at a law firm and also volunteered in the field of environmental law. Rudy was a direct descendant of Thomas Soule and Richard Warren of the Mayflower. She was a long term member of the Colony Club, The New York Junior League, the Cold Spring Harbor Beach Club and The Colonial Dames of America. She was a champion bridge player, representing the bridge team for the Colony Club for many years. She was interviewed by Dan Rather on CBS 60 Minutes II, and by others on television, on the topic of the Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco International Ltd. trial, in which she was involved. She advocated that as there was not sufficient evidence in the initial trial to establish the defendant's guilt, as she saw it, the presumption of innocence must prevail. Rudy was an optimist and an idealist; a person of great fortitude and original thought. Always supportive of her children and grandchildren, and an extremely warm and devoted mother, she set an example of determination and creative solutions in the face of adversity. Rudy is survived by her two children, Jennifer Jordan McCall and William Winston Jordan, a daughter-in-law, Denise A. Walter, three grandchildren, Caroline Debevoise Clark, Hillary Sage Clark and Samantha Marie Jordan, and by a sister, Joan Bennett Gordon of Glenview, Illinois.

The technology to read and analyze an individual's DNA exists, but high costs have kept it out of reach for many people. But within the next five years, according to this program, sequencing an individual's complete genome could cost less than $1,000, making the procedure more accessible. Scientists believe the sequencing could help predict a person's genetic vulnerability to particular illnesses. That, in turn, could mean more personalized preventive medical treatment. 10:45 A.M.

She supported the organization, ""Are You Dense?,"" lobbied for the bill in Albany, and started an advocacy blog. The bill became NYS law in January, 2013. Hallie brought the same passion, intellect, and devotion to this cause as to her other interests and many friendships.

""I treat words I have just learned like new acquaintances; no matter how well we hit it off on a first meeting, I don't assume intimacy."" With her late father, the actor/impersonator Jan Leighton, she co-authored two books, Rare Words I and II (Levenger Press, 2003, 2008), which used humor to help master meanings.

(HBO) SAVING FACE (2011) In Pakistan throwing acid on women to disfigure them is an alarmingly common form of revenge, often for rejected sexual advances or marriage proposals. The victims are left physically and emotionally scarred, with little or no access to reconstructive surgery, while the assailants, typically husbands or someone else close to the victim, are frequently released with minimal punishment. In this Oscar-winning short documentary Daniel Junge and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy tell the stories of two women -- 39-year-old Zakia, above, whose husband threw acid on her after she filed for divorce, and Rukhsana, 25, whose husband and in-laws threw acid and gasoline on her, then set her on fire -- as they seek justice with the help of the Acid Survivors Foundation in Islamabad and Dr. Mohammad Jawad, a Pakistani-born plastic surgeon who stepped away from his London practice to help victims of what he called society's disease. The film also follows the push for stricter sentencing laws for attacks on the women whom Rukhsana calls ''the living dead.'' 6 A.M. (Sundance) AMREEKA (2009) Nisreen Faour, below, plays Muna Farah, a divorced Palestinian with a green card who at the outset of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 forsakes a relatively comfortable existence to travel to America with her 16-year-old son, Fadi (Melkar Muallem). The result is an exercise in confronting hostility and prejudice. Writing in The New York Times about this film from Cherien Dabis, a Palestinian-Jordanian whose parents moved to the United States before she was born, Stephen Holden said, '' 'Amreeka' (the Arabic word for America) stands alongside 'The Visitor' and 'Maria Full of Grace' as one of the most accomplished recent films about a non-European immigrant coming to the United States.''"

The decision, the most newsworthy result of a busy committee meeting, sets aside a controversial precedent from 2009 when the three teenage boys sharing the lead role in “Billy Elliot” were deemed eligible for a joint best actor nomination — and went on to win that June. The producers of “Matilda,” itself a front-runner for the best musical Tony this year, had sought joint eligibility for the four girls — Sophia Gennusa, Oona Laurence, Bailey Ryon and Milly Shapiro. Instead of granting that request, the Tony committee announced in a statement that the actresses would receive a special award — Tony Honors for Excellence in the Theater — “to recognize their outstanding performances this season.” As a result, none will be eligible in the best actress category."

Leslie Bibb stars as Amanda Vaughn, a onetime high school mean girl who is forced to return to Dallas in disgrace after her marriage ends in scandal.

But the competition in Manhattan is tough, and the bar's former owner opens a new establishment that attracts the old customers."

The director Werner Herzog combed through their footage to create this documentary, which casts an unsentimental eye on Treadwell's mission to protect the grizzlies and questions his preparation for life in the wilderness. Interviews with family members and friends shed light on Treadwell's past as an actor who struggled with addiction.

She gave media interviews telling her own story, urging women to find out if they have dense tissue, not itself abnormal but sometimes masking tumors in mammograms, and to inquire about further testing. She supported the organization, ""Are You Dense?,"" lobbied for the bill in Albany, and started an advocacy blog. The bill became NYS law in January, 2013. Hallie brought the same passion, intellect, and devotion to this cause as to her other interests and many friendships. Born and raised in NYC, Hallie went to the High School of Performing Arts, attended St. John's College in Annapolis, and graduated from the Santa Fe campus where she was editor of the college newspaper. Her career was varied, but never strayed far from her love of language and writing. She started collecting words at age 13 when she encountered hussar and bivouac in Tolstoy's War and Peace. ""I treat words I have just learned like new acquaintances; no matter how well we hit it off on a first meeting, I don't assume intimacy."" With her late father, the actor/impersonator Jan Leighton, she co-authored two books, Rare Words I and II (Levenger Press, 2003, 2008), which used humor to help master meanings. After college, Hallie worked at Random House and Knopf, was a writer's assistant on As the World Turns at CBS, and wrote columns for Cotton, Inc. that appeared regularly in Women's Wear Daily. She went to Israel in an arts program in the Negev, where she wrote about the Bedouin and stayed two more years because ""the adventure wasn't over,"" working with organizations that promoted peace between Arabs and Israelis. Back in the U.S. she became Director of Communications for Charity Brands, a firm that connected corporations with good causes. At the time of her death, she was working on a documentary on her father's unusual career - he had played more roles than any other actor (2407) according to the 1985 Guinness Book of World Records.

Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Tommasini called this five-hour production, presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met,'' ''the most theatrically effective staging of the four works in this epic series, and the clearest representation of the director Robert Lepage's vision.'' Still, he said of the 45-ton mechanical set at the center of the cycle, ''Part of me wanted to see the machine collapse into a heap of smoldering planks at the end of the Immolation Scene, which would have been appropriate.'' 9:15 A.M. (MoreMax) THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (2011) Matt Damon, his toothy grin hinting at a young Robert F.

Their plan does not include Emily, or free will on David's part, for that matter. Now he must decide whether to give in to their machinations -- or reclaim his life. If George Nolfi, who directed this film and wrote the screenplay, based on a short story by Philip K.

Her play ''HARVEY,'' about a man and his tall, invisible rabbit friend, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1944 and ran in its original Broadway production for more than four years. Now Roundabout Theater Company is reviving Chase's comedy in the first Broadway production of the 2012-13 season. When a show opens amid the feverish fuss about Tony Awards for the prior season, as ''Harvey'' is doing, its performances are often forgotten a year later. But the Roundabout has assembled a cast as likely to be memorable as any, led by Jim Parsons, the two-time Emmy Award winner for his portrayal of Sheldon Cooper, the charming nerd of a theoretical physicist on the CBS comedy ''The Big Bang Theory.'' He plays the rabbit-friendly Elwood P. Dowd, a role memorably played by James Stewart in the 1950 film version and the 1970 Broadway revival. Scott Ellis directs a cast that also includes Jessica Hecht, Charles Kimbrough, Larry Bryggman and Carol Kane.

Lou is survived by his beloved daughter Erika Scheimer and his son Lane Scheimer. At his side over these final days were Erika, who worked with her father for decades at Filmation, the company founded by Lou, Norm Prescott, and Hal Sutherland in the early sixties. Also on hand throughout Lou's final days were his devoted daughter-in-law, Amy Rosenberg, and sundry close friends, former employees and relations. Lou's wife Jay Scheimer, had passed in 2009. Lou often said that Jay was truly the woman behind the man, and she was greatly instrumental in making Filmation a reality. He often said that he could never have survived the early years without Jay's support. They were a most colorful couple; back in the day, some referred to them as the ""George and Gracie"" of the animation crowd. Lou graduated from Carnegie-Tech in 1952, married in 1953 and moved to Los Angeles in 1955 to work in the animation industry. In 1962, Filmation Studios was created and became one of the world's premiere animation houses. During this early period, the studio produced TV commercials and documentaries. In 1965, the studio unveiled its first Saturday morning series, ""Superman"", a solid hit which ran for three years on CBS. Soon to follow were a string of shows, including the arrival of ""Aquaman"", ""Batman"" and the phenomenally rated ""Archies"" show. Lou was widely credited with starting Saturday morning cartoons. From the ""Archies"" cartoons came the number one hit song ""Sugar, Sugar"", which has been re-recorded through the years some 29 times and counting! It was also the number two song of the 1960's, second only to the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". A number one song from a cartoon? This was the first animated show to include original songs with each episode. This was one of many ""firsts"" achieved throughout the life of Filmation. The praise from critics and viewers alike was even more enthusiastic for Filmation's proudest animation achievement, ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"". In its twelve year run, ""Fat Albert"" was acclaimed by parents, educators and children everywhere. It received countless honors, including a number of Emmy nominations and the prestigious Peabody Award. It was the show that Lou was most proud of. From then on, he made it his life's mission to produce children's shows that not only were entertaining, but also contained pro-social values and messages. After ""Fat Albert"" aired in the early seventies, Filmation had truly come into its own as a giant in the field of animation.

Subsequently, Lou ventured into live-action shows with such hits as ""Shazam-Isis Hour"", the original ""Ghostbusters"", ""Ark II"", ""Space Academy"" and ""Jason of Star Command"". In addition, Filmation made a triumphant foray into theatrical feature production with ""Journey Back to Oz"" in 1973. That year also marked the first of many prime time specials, including ""Oliver Twist"", ""Treasure Island"", ""Fat Albert"" and ""A Snow White Christmas"". In 1981, Filmation unveiled ""Blackstarr"", a sword and sorcery fantasy that rocketed to the top of the Saturday morning ratings. This was not surprising considering Filmation's acknowledged leadership in producing quality animated adventure shows. Beginning with ""Fantastic Voyage"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" in 1967, the studio went on to produce the now classic, Emmy award winning animated ""Star Trek"" series, as well as animated versions of ""Tarzan"", ""Zorro"", ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Flash Gordon."" In 1983, Lou created the marketplace for first-run syndication of animated shows. Filmation took on its most ambitious project to date: the ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" series. Over the years Filmation produced 130 ""He-Man"" episodes directly for syndication. Once again, Lou made positive messages a hallmark of the show. The results: another winner, both in domestic ratings and in unprecedented international sales in thirty countries in the first year alone. Two years later, in 1985, Filmation brought He-Man's twin sister ""She-Ra, Princess of Power"" to the syndicated world. Lou always felt that little girls were underserved in the world of super heroes. He made it a cause to change that with She-Ra. It too was a huge success at home and abroad.

Lou's legacy of shows saw a whole new life in recent years, as DVD collections of his many shows began to proliferate in the 1990's. The fact that a new generation of kids would be able to watch his Filmation shows gave Lou endless joy. Hundreds of fan mail letters and emails just keep on coming.

Lou is survived by his beloved daughter Erika Scheimer and his son Lane Scheimer. At his side over these final days were Erika, who worked with her father for decades at Filmation, the company founded by Lou, Norm Prescott, and Hal Sutherland in the early sixties. Also on hand throughout Lou's final days were his devoted daughter-in-law, Amy Rosenberg, and sundry close friends, former employees and relations. Lou's wife Jay Scheimer, had passed in 2009. Lou often said that Jay was truly the woman behind the man, and she was greatly instrumental in making Filmation a reality. He often said that he could never have survived the early years without Jay's support. They were a most colorful couple; back in the day, some referred to them as the ""George and Gracie"" of the animation crowd. Lou graduated from Carnegie-Tech in 1952, married in 1953 and moved to Los Angeles in 1955 to work in the animation industry. In 1962, Filmation Studios was created and became one of the world's premiere animation houses. During this early period, the studio produced TV commercials and documentaries. In 1965, the studio unveiled its first Saturday morning series, ""Superman"", a solid hit which ran for three years on CBS. Soon to follow were a string of shows, including the arrival of ""Aquaman"", ""Batman"" and the phenomenally rated ""Archies"" show. Lou was widely credited with starting Saturday morning cartoons. From the ""Archies"" cartoons came the number one hit song ""Sugar, Sugar"", which has been re-recorded through the years some 29 times and counting! It was also the number two song of the 1960's, second only to the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". A number one song from a cartoon? This was the first animated show to include original songs with each episode. This was one of many ""firsts"" achieved throughout the life of Filmation. The praise from critics and viewers alike was even more enthusiastic for Filmation's proudest animation achievement, ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"".

Bruno Gibson, OP. Surviving are her husband Ronald, and her children Christopher, Peter and Hans, her brother Harris Steiner, her daughters-in-law: Mary, Jennifer, and Anessa, her beloved grandchildren Katharine, Eric and Soren, Alexandra Ruth (in utero), and her nieces Laura Durbahn of Kerman, CA, Cynthia Ganz of Seattle, Elise Winter of Loomis, CA., nephew Carl Steiner of San Diego, and grandnieces and grandnephews. Ruth will be greatly missed by her dear friends: sorority sister and fellow teacher Celia Gunn Ginnado of Arlington Heights, Ill., Sra. Imelda Espiritu of Berkeley, and Christina Ahengua of Richmond. And also her classmates and friends from The Sigma Kappa sorority at UC Berkeley, and her classmates from Kerman HS., the parishioners and teachers at School of the Madeleine, and at St. Mary's College HS. A proud native of California, she was born at St. Agnes Hospital in Fresno. She graduated from Kerman HS with honors, Cheerleader, Girls Athletic Association and Tennis Team letters, International Quill and Scroll Society for Journalism, and a California Scholarship Federation (CSF) Member. The daughter of Thelma Harris Steiner, a California school teacher, and Rene Steiner, a Kerman raisin grower and RFD mailman. Ruth was a member of the The Order of Rainbow for Girls, and a California Raisin Queen. She was a 5-year 4H Achievement Award winner. Following her brother Harris's example, Ruth matriculated at UC Berkeley in 1953 and joined the Sigma Kappa sorority. Walking to class one day in her first year, she met her husband-to-be, and they began an odyssey for life. Ruth as: teacher, then through the active years of raising her boys, as an interior designer and her designs include offices and living areas for the Christian Brothers-De La Salle Institute Winery (her leaded glass door panels bearing the CB seal are still in use at the Sutter Home Winery in St. Helena, CA.) For nearly six years she was national sale representative for her partnership in the Abundance Winery in Sonoma. In the latter role she was thrilled to encounter a former member of her son's class at the Madeleine - he was a competitor salesman at a dealer in Chicago. He afterward joked of losing that sale, as it was unfair to have to compete against ""a Mom with all that charm."" â€¨Meantime, she completed her studies at UC, graduating BA as an UC Alumni Scholar in the same ceremony with Ron gaining his JD. Now all of the Larsons were Cal Bears. Ruth was active in the School of the Madeleine at their family parish: re-founding the Bridge Club, leading the Cub's Scouts, and singing in Father Larry's choir. The boys went on to the St. Mary's College High School where she helped the Brothers of the Christian Schools, Eunice Jackson and other mothers, found the Belles of St. Mary's as a scholarship organization for the school. She didn't know ""slow."" She spent her days and nights teaching, counseling, feeding and loving her family, gardening, playing the piano at midnite home sessions, dancing at the Parish parties, traveling with Ron, skiing with the boys, and as a member of the Art Deco Society of San Francisco. Always a lady: raised by her Convent trained mother, she was initiated in 1953, by her new friend on Milvia Street, Pat Sager, to wear gloves and scarf and hat and take lunch at the City of Paris. A propriety she must have been one of the last to relinquish. But she wore her scarves and gloves until the day she died. All Services will be at the St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church 2005 Berryman St, Berkeley, California 94709 (510-526-4811) as follows: Thursday, September 6th at 7PM - The Holy Rosary of the Virgin Mary; Friday, September 7th at 10:30AM - Mass - followed immediately by reception and refreshments in Norton Hall (directly under the Church - entry from the parking lot).

''Larry King Now,'' which Mr. King created in partnership with a new digital video network, Ora TV, is an example of how the Internet accommodates old age as easily as youth.

(Sundance) ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLD (2008) For this documentary Werner Herzog traveled to Antarctica, where he met scientists and journeymen (above, a diver under the ice) at the American outpost McMurdo Station and the penguins, seals, clams and jellyfish that surround them on what might as well be another planet. ''Few filmmakers make the end of days seem as hauntingly beautiful as Werner Herzog does, or as inexorable,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. One of the film's beauties, Ms. Dargis said, ''is that all the furry and floating animals are no more wondrous than the bipeds tramping through and around McMurdo: the linguist turned philosopher, the banker turned bus driver and the female adventurer who, for drama and odd entertainment, likes to have herself zipped up in a carryall bag. (She's her own baggage.) Mr. Herzog opens his mind, heart and eyes to all these wayfarers who -- despite the persistent strain of melancholy that touches each and every person who appears on camera -- seem eerily at peace at the bottom of the world.''

Scott said that despite very fine actors -- among them Stephen Fry, Sam Waterston, Stockard Channing, Glenn Close (above right, with Ms. Hudson), Leslie Caron and Thierry Lhermitte -- the film ''is pretty weak tea, a thin and unsatisfying concoction that somehow manages to make one of the richest and most durable sources of culture-clash comedy into an occasion for dullness.''

Born on January 5, 1942, she was the only child of George Edward Fulop and Elizabeth Helen (Meruse) Fulop. Nancy was raised in Toledo, Ohio, first in its Birmingham neighborhood until her family moved to the Point Place neighborhood in the late 1940s. Eventually, she moved to New York City to practice law and into Lincoln Plaza Tower, an apartment building overlooking Lincoln Center and Central Park, where she lived from 1976 until her death. She was the wife of William P. Short III, whom she married in 1978, and the mother of Bradford W. Short, who was born in 1979. Both survive her. Until she became ill, she was an active member of the Certificate of Appropriateness Committee of Landmark West as well as of her building's co-op board. She was a parishioner of the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, where she also served as a lector. She was especially fond of reading at the Easter Vigil and Christmas Eve Masses. After she retired, she was a student at the New York School of Interior Design (""NYSID""), where she was pursuing an associate degree in interior design. Her hope was to graduate from NYSID and work in the interior design industry. Nancy worked for Bowne & Co. Inc., first as Editor of its Legal Publishing Division from 1997 to early 2003 and then as Editor of Bowne's securities compliance resource, SecuritiesConnect, from 2003 to late 2005.

She practiced as a corporate and securities attorney in New York for ten years at Skadden, Burns Summit and Warshaw Burstein and as an assistant professor of corporate finance and securities law at Rutgers School of Law-Camden for four years. She was awarded a J.D. degree from The University of Toledo - College of Law, where she was first in her class, and an LL.M. degree from Yale Law School. She was a graduate of St. Ursula Academy and Mary Manse College, both located in Toledo. She was valedictorian of her class at St. Ursula and was awarded the Bishop's Cross. At Mary Manse College, she graduated summa cum laude. Nancy taught high school art as well as English literature in the Toledo school system before starting her legal career.

The No. 1 movie was a holdover: ""The Possession"" (Lionsgate) took in an estimated $9.5 million, for a two-week total of about $33.3 million, according to Hollywood.com , which compiles box-office data. The Weinstein Company's ""Lawless"" was second, selling about $6 million in tickets, for a two-week total of $23.5 million. In its fourth weekend ""The Expendables 2"" (Lionsgate) placed fourth, grossing about $4.8 million and lifting its total to $75.4 million. ""The Bourne Legacy"" (Universal Pictures) was fifth, taking in an estimated $4 million, for a five-week total of $103.7 million.

(USA) POLITICAL ANIMALS Sigourney Weaver (above, with James Wolk, left, and Brent Jennings), in a role based on Hillary Rodham Clinton, portrays Elaine Barrish Hammond, a former first lady who ran for president and became secretary of state in this new mini-series. She's married to a philandering former president, Bud Hammond (Ciaran Hinds), but in this make-believe version, Elaine doesn't stand by her man -- she divorces him. Carla Gugino is Susan Berg, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for writing about Bud's infidelities, and who has exclusive access to Elaine in exchange for keeping the news about the Hammonds' troubled son, T. J. (Sebastian Stan), quiet. (His twin, Douglas, played by Mr. Wolk, is Elaine's chief of staff.) And Adrian Pasdar is President Paul Garcetti, the charismatic candidate who beat Elaine for the Democratic nomination. ''It may be too soon to assess her place in history, but it is already clear that Mrs. Clinton has a huge hold on the public imagination: a woman so well known, and yet so unknowable, that writers and filmmakers keep turning to fiction to try to solve her mystery,'' Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. She added: ''Mrs. Clinton's life, with all its political triumphs and private torments, turned out to be juicier than any script a movie or television studio could conjure. And the writers, at least, don't want that to end. 'Can you keep a secret?' Elaine asks a Secret Service agent at her side. 'I'm going to run for president again, and this time I'm going to win.'

(13, 49) DOWNTON ABBEY ''Masterpiece Classic'' inaugurates a new chapter in this soap opera, created by Julian Fellowes, about masters and servants at the twilight of the British Empire. Hugh Bonneville returns as Lord Grantham, who, with three daughters and no direct male heir, is being forced to hand down his beloved ancestral home to a middle-class third cousin, Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens), along with the fortune of his American-born heiress wife (Elizabeth McGovern, above). Maggie Smith is his imperious mother, and Siobhan Finneran is Miss O'Brien, Lady Grantham's Machiavellian maid. The story reopens in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme, where Matthew -- his romance with Lord Grantham's eldest daughter, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), derailed -- is now an officer trying to keep his troops alive. ''As the dowager countess, Ms. Smith has many of the best lines and usually the last word,'' Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. ''When her middle granddaughter, Lady Edith, frets that she will end up a spinster, Lady Violet says briskly, 'Don't be defeatist, Dear, it's very middle class.'

2963,,"Paid Notice: Deaths HANNAH, ANDREW L.",https://www.nytimes.com/Link.asp?I=LS000161904340,"<!-- ANDREW L. HANNAH -->HANNAH--Andrew Lee, 62, a longtime humanitarian organization executive, passed away suddenly at his home in Onancock, VA on Sunday, December 9th. Born in 1950, Hannah is the son of the late Virginia Sterling Hannah and Andrew Lee Hannah of Charleston, SC. ""Drew,"" as he is known to friends and family, divided his time between New Canaan, CT and his home in Onancock on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. He attended the Notre Dame International High School, Virginia Military Institute and graduated from the University of South Carolina with a BA degree. Drew spent his entire career leading charitable causes, serving as a non-profit executive for more than 20 years. Previous to devoting his career to humanitarian causes, Drew was a contractor building homes across Colorado through the 1980s and 1990s. An accomplished skier and instructor, Drew spent his weekends teaching skiing to handicapped children. During that time, Drew also helped found the â€œChristmas in April Programâ€ in Philadelphia (CIAP) in 1988. Since its founding, CIAP and its 1,000-plus volunteer force have helped hundreds of families rehabilitate and restore their homes throughout the west and North Philadelphia areas. He went on to become an executive with AmeriCares, a leading United States-based non-governmental humanitarian organization. One of Drew's greatest joys was as Director of AmeriCares â€œCamp AmeriKids,â€ a camp designed to enhance lives of youth living with HIV/AIDS. Following the aftermath of 9/11, Drew co-founded Bridge Foundation along with Stephen B. Skakel. The Bridge Foundation provides emergency and long term humanitarian assistance in response to disasters - both man-made and natural -- across the U.S. and around the world. For the past decade, the foundation has led corporate and privately sponsored missions to such disaster hot spots as Darfur Sudan, Eastern Chad, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iraq, Congo, Gabon, Albania, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Grenada and the U.S. Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina. More recently, Drew led Bridge to facilitate humanitarian aid relief to Louisiana following hurricane Isaac and across the New York and New Jersey metropolitan area after Hurricane Sandy. Previously with Americares, Drew led missions to Bosnia, Cuba, Kosovo, Somalia, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Chechnya, Azerbaijan, Georgia and North Korea. A hands-on expert on humanitarian relief issues, Drew, has been a sought-after source for media commentary on humanitarian relief issues. He has been interviewed by several news organizations such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Time, Newsweek and Business Week. He has also appeared on programs across the broadcast network spectrum including the CBS Evening News, NBC News with Tom Brokaw, the Today Show, Good Morning America, Larry King Live, the Charlie Rose Show, FOX News, CNN, and many others. Drew has also provided government testimony to the House Committee on International Relations and has participated on foreign relations-focused panel discussions at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, the University of Notre Dame Business School and the Woodrow Wilson Center. Through his work and his personal faith, Drew had a deep, personal commitment to take action on events and help people and families find their way through the most horrific of situations. Whether it was leading one of the first humanitarian airlifts to Haiti after the devastating earthquake, or delivering food, cooking oil (and candy) to orphanages in war-ravaged Afghanistan, Drew lived for these missions. When the call came in to rush medical supplies to a children's hospital in Iraq, or, closer to home, delivering bottled water and generators to power up an emergency operations center after a hurricane, Drew never said it couldn't be done. ""We'll put our best people on it,"" was his stock response. And he delivered. Drew Hannah changed the lives of many people around the world and was fearless in his pursuits to help others. He also brought out the best of every person and situation. An accomplished chef, Drew was also an animal lover and a genuine connoisseur of fine wine and food. But most of all, he cherished the friendships he created over a lifetime of helping people. Drew is survived by his sister, Sterling Hannah, of Charleston, SC and his beloved dogs Raymond ""Floyd"" and Addie. There will be a remembrance celebration in his home town of Onancock, VA, Sunday, January 20, 2013, at Mallards at the Wharf between 2pm and 6pm. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to Bridge Foundation, PO Box 388 New Canaan, CT 06840, or the ESSPCA, PO Box 164, Onley, VA 23418.

Usually the only thing left would be the tax write-offs. But even as the biggest flop of the season, ''Leap of Faith'' had an unusual asterisk - its single Tony Award nomination, a major one, for best musical. And so the producers had a decision to make: Whether to leave ''Leap of Faith'' dead and buried, or capitalize on the nomination and pay to stage a musical number on the Tony Awards telecast on CBS on June 10? The producers opted to go for it, and have raised roughly $150,000 to secure a spot for the number at the Tonys ceremony, according to two Broadway industry executives familiar with the plans; they divulged the information on condition of anonymity to preserve their relationships with the ''Leap'' producers, who declined to comment. But a spokeswoman for the producers said that they had raised enough money to stage the number, though she declined to confirm the amount."

The format is similar to CBS's long-running summer series ''Big Brother,'' and ABC has hired many former production members from that show. On Friday CBS sent a sternly worded letter to ABC about it. The letter implies, without directly saying so, that CBS will sue ABC over copyright infringement. The letter said that CBS was ''putting ABC on notice that its continued development and production of 'Glass House' exposes ABC to liability.'' The letter said the elements of the new show are ''substantially and strikingly'' similar to ''Big Brother.'' In ''Glass House,'' which has its debut on June 18, 14 people are chosen to live in a house all summer with cameras on them in pursuit of a cash prize -- the essence of ''Big Brother'' competition. In the past copyright cases have proved nearly impossible for reality-show plaintiffs to win because, in simple terms, everybody's reality is inherently different. The total number of former staff members on ''Glass House'' is at least 18, according to the CBS letter, all of whom signed nondisclosure agreements when they worked for ''Big Brother.'' The CBS letter argued that it would be impossible for anyone who signed such a letter to help produce a similar show without breaching the agreement. ABC had yet to respond to the CBS letter or requests for comment by Sunday afternoon."
