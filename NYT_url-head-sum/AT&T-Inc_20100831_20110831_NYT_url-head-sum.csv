Valerie was the devoted wife of the late George T. Delacorte, founder of Dell Publishing Company and a well known New York and Florida philanthropist. Valerie was born in Budapest, Hungary and educated at the Ursuline Convent. Graced with stunning beauty, intellect and elegant style, Valerie became a stage and film actress in Hungary under the name Hidveghy Valeria. Valerie's earlier marriage was to Gabriel Pascal, Hollywood's renowned film producer of George Bernard Shaw's plays, including ""Major Barbara"", ""Caesar"" and ""Cleopatra"" and it was Pascal's idea to turn ""Pygmalion"" into a musical which became a reality as ""My Fair Lady"" after Pascal's death in 1954. Valerie authored a memoir entitled, ""The Disciple and His Devil,"" to reveal an extraordinarily close view of Shaw and Pascal, and their charged, creative success. Valerie's glamorous, high-profile love and heartache with Pascal, included socializing with the legendary figures Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison. McGraw Hill published Valerie's memoir in 1970; Michael Joseph re-published the book in England in 1972; IUniverse re-issued it in 2004; and, in 2008 the book was translated and published in Hungary. Valerie donated the voluminous Shaw-Pascal correspondence to Boston University. Valerie and George greatly enjoyed their life together in New York, Florida and Connecticut, traveling, collecting art, and taking pride in the many gifts George gave to New York City, in particular, the Delacorte Musical Clock, Alice in Wonderland Statue and the Delacorte Shakespeare Amphitheatre, all in Central Park. George was a major benefactor of Columbia University, and established the Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism. Following George's death in 1991, Valerie served as a Trustee of the Center until 2001. In honor of her beloved husband, George, Valerie contributed their vast art collection of Old Masters to the Norton Museum of Art in Florida. Valerie was a devout Catholic, and her faith defined her journey through life, and inspired her friendships and charitable commitments to the poor and homeless and to other philanthropies. The Funeral Service and Christian Mass will be offered at 10am on Monday, August 8th at St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue at 84th Street, followed by her burial to rest in eternal peace in the Delacorte Mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery, Webster Avenue & East 233rd Street, Bronx, NY.

A small percentage of iPhone 4 users need a case, and we want to continue providing them a Bumper case for free. For everyone else, we are discontinuing the free case program on all iPhone 4s sold after September 30, 2010.

Users experiencing antenna issues should call AppleCare to request a free Bumper case.The quick take on this might be ''Apple to Discontinue iPhone 4 Case Program,'' but that is not quite what is happening here. The more accurate summation is ''Apple to Make You Jump Through a New Hoop to Get an iPhone 4 Case.'' Note the careful language in sentences two and three. Apple is not saying you can't have a free iPhone case anymore - it is saying that the company won't be distributing them as a matter of course. Furthermore, the iPhone app that people have been using to order their free case will no longer be available after Sept. 30. If you buy an iPhone after that date and feel that you're losing your signal, you can still call AppleCare and explain your situation. Those who are having signal dropouts can still get a free case from the company.",

Valerie donated the voluminous Shaw-Pascal correspondence to Boston University. Valerie and George greatly enjoyed their life together in New York, Florida and Connecticut, traveling, collecting art, and taking pride in the many gifts George gave to New York City, in particular, the Delacorte Musical Clock, Alice in Wonderland Statue and the Delacorte Shakespeare Amphitheatre, all in Central Park. George was a major benefactor of Columbia University, and established the Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism. Following George's death in 1991, Valerie served as a Trustee of the Center until 2001. In honor of her beloved husband, George, Valerie contributed their vast art collection of Old Masters to the Norton Museum of Art in Florida. Valerie was a devout Catholic, and her faith defined her journey through life, and inspired her friendships and charitable commitments to the poor and homeless and to other philanthropies.

On Friday, Mr. Mason rejected Google's $6 billion bid, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. The move quashed the search giant's hope of buying the fast-growing social buying site and put Groupon on track for an eventual public offering. Whether his gamble is a brilliant play or a Friendster fumble - the once promising social network that tumbled after snubbing an offer from Google - remains to be seen. For now, Mr. Mason, who is currently juggling television appearances and managing a recent spike in traffic, seems content with Groupon's trajectory. Mr. Mason spoke with DealBook on Wednesday about his company's prospects, the opportunities in the local advertising market, and why he likes dollhouses. Q.How was Friday? A.What happened on Friday?

They underscore the unresolved Oedipal problems (not unlike those of George W.

''The Bin Ladens,'' by Steve Coll, also adds new details to our understanding of how the young Bin Laden evolved from a loyal family adjutant into an angry black sheep lashing out at some of the very connections his father and brothers had cultivated in their business dealings for years.",

Warner Brothers' New Line Cinema unit and MGM have worked out their deal to finance the pair of films to be based on J. R. R. Tolkien's novel, and Peter Jackson's deal to direct is now finalized, according to a person who was briefed on the movie's intricacies this week. But continuing uncertainty over attempts to have the filmmakers bargain collectively with their actors in New Zealand still stands between the production and its planned February start date (already delayed from an anticipated January date). New Zealand officials have said the production can't legally enter a collective bargaining arrangement with its actor-contractors, but unions there have insisted that a deal could be struck. If the studios move the film out of New Zealand, the budget, which already runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars, would have to be redrawn, and at least some further delay would be inevitable.",

Eight large watch tables allow for accessible, easy viewing from all sides, while digital screens embedded in walls feature informative, up-to-the-minute videos. The store also features its own Rolex boutique — New York City’s first — which occupies almost a third of the space. To celebrate the new Madison Avenue location, Tourneau has launched a new line of timepieces, the TNY series, with the clean lines and strong look of the city that inspired it.
