He served in the U.S. Navy during World War Two as a Specialist for Welfare and Recreation and was the organist for all chapel activities at the U.S. Naval Base in Little Creek, Maryland. Subsequent to his naval service he was employed in the family business in New York City, then known as the United Paste and Glue Company. Along with his father, Herman C. Loderhose, he built United into the national adhesive manufacturer called United Resin Products, Inc. He was a gifted CEO, master salesman, and innovator in packaging patents, coatings and adhesives. In 1997, Mr. Loderhose sold United to the Henkel Corporation and remained with Henkel for the next four years as a senior director of the company. Mr. Loderhose had a lifelong passion for music, particularly the theatre organ. He was well known for his preservation, restoration, perfor mance, and support of the instrument. The gem of his extensive collection being the 55 rank New York Paramount Studio Theatre Organ, until recently located at the family owned Bay Theatre in Seal Beach, California. In June, 2007, Mr. Loderhose gifted this magnificent instrument to The Beatitudes Campus in Phoenix, Arizona where it is being reinstalled for the enjoyment of the residents, members, congregants, staff and the entire Phoenix and theatre organ community. He was a past president and founding member of the American Theatre Organ Society. He played the organ professionally under the name Dick Scott and made numerous recordings for his own label, Renwick Recordings, Inc. as well as for United Artists Records. An avid yachtsman, Mr. Loderhose also had a great passion for World War Two Air Sea Rescue boats. He refurbished and restored numerous rescue/crash boats during his lifetime (Music Man I through VI) and was often a speaker at events sponsored by crash boat organizations throughout the country. His philanthropy included the donation of a restored 64 foot rescue boat to the Sea Scouts of Marina Del Rey, California. When Mr. Loderhose retired from the glue business in 1997 he spent most of his remaining years in Newport Beach, California attending to his yachting and musical interests. He was a member of the Balboa Bay Club, Newport Beach, California. His final years were spent in Tampa, Florida. He is at rest now knowing that whatever his passion, he succeeded. He would want everyone to know that he truly had a ball and would go out playing ''Ain't Misbehavin'' or ''Anchors Away'' if he could; and those who knew him would agree. Life was good.

He was 36. Jonathan was born and raised in Thibodaux, Louisiana. He attended Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, and received a Master's degree in Theatre from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana. He moved to New York City in the autumn of 1996. He joined the Box Office staff at The New Victory Theater in the early days of the ''new'' 42nd Street when shuttered porn shops still lined the street. He then served a brief tenure at the William Morris Agency before becoming Executive Assistant to the President of The Rolfe Company, a Manhattan-based agency representing theatrical designers. A walking encyclopedia of American popular culture, Jonathan founded and served as Editor-in-Chief and Managing Director of www.tvdvdreviews.com, one of the first Web sites dedicated to reviewing television productions released on DVD. The site, which earned a loyal following for its pithy and timely reviews, regularly receives upwards of 3,000 visitors a day. From the time of his diagnosis in February 2005 until his death, Jonathan met his cancer with characteristically fierce stubbornness, irreverent humor, black sarcasm, and an even-keeled, clear head. His tenacity-combined with the unyielding support of friends and family--enabled him to survive countless rounds of chemotherapy, two bone marrow transplants, two brain tumors, and a cord blood transplant. He left his family and friends after affirming on multiple occasions that be couldn't have been happier and more, content with the life he led and the adventures he shared. Jonathan Boudreaux is survived by his longtime partner and companion, Christopher W. Czajka; his parents, Gail C. and Ronnie Boudreaux of Thibodaux; his sister Jenise and brother-inlaw Brian Jennings, also of Thibodaux; his grandparents, Orena and ''Red'' Adams; and countless aunts, uncles, cousins, neighbors, and family friends in Louisiana. He is also survived by scores of friends in New York City and across the country. Particularly steadfast in their support of Jonathan throughout his disease have been his boss and good friend Mickey Rolfe, Nicole Roberts, Kelly Demaret, Marsha Drummond, Kerri Chyka, and Sam Buffer, all of New York; Duane and Barb Czajka and Billie Lape of Rochester, NY; Kay and Eamon Daly and Katie Heilman of Chicago, IL; Allison Dillon of Nashville, TN; Caroline and Colette LaGarde of Raceland, LA; and the staff of the Education Department at Thirteen/WNET. Jonathan will also be remembered and celebrated by a new generation of relatives and friends, including his nephew Draven Michael Jennings and young Norah Elizabeth Czajka and Ian Stuart Lape. At Jonathan's request, no memorial service or funeral will be held. His most ardent wish was for his family and friends to briefly mourn his passing, and then live their lives to their happiest and fullest potential. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow.org), which provides patients around the world with life-saving bone marrow, cord blood, and stem cell transplants. He will be sorely missed. BOUDREAUX--Jonathan J. Our clients join me in grieving Jonathan's death and in sending our deep respect and condolences to his partner, Chris; his parents Gail and Ronnie; and his sister, Jenise. Jonathan's three-and-a-half year battle with leukemia was a lesson in grace, dignity, and the complete absence of selfpity --one we'd give anything not to have had to learn this way. We are profoundly indebted to him for his diligence and wisdom. We'll remember him for his gallantry, his unfailing sense of humor, that smile, and his sheer cussedness.

Then, accompanied by his wife, Janet, his daughter, Sarah, and his press secretary, Alice Stewart -- who doubles as his Boston Marathon trainer -- he walked into the dark, freezing morning, climbed into a waiting S.U.V. and headed for Central College in Pella, Iowa. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, was in a buoyant mood on three hours of sleep. The night before, his commercial flight suffered a long Chicago holdover on the way from Boston, but he had reason to hope that his days at the mercy of the airlines might be numbered. A Des Moines Register opinion poll had just shown Huckabee passing Mitt Romney to take the lead in the run-up to the Jan. 3 caucus. His picture, he already knew, was on the front page of that morning's USA Today. Now he was headed to Central College, to appear, surrounded by enthusiastic students, on ''The Early Show'' on CBS. This kind of momentum, he hoped, would finally produce enough cash to allow him to charter his own plane. The governor was especially happy that morning about an impending endorsement he expected (and received the following day) from Tim LaHaye, the author of the apocalyptic ''Left Behind'' series of novels. ''Left Behind'' is wildly popular among evangelicals, who have bought more than 65 million copies, making LaHaye a very rich man and one of the few writers who is also a major philanthropist. Recently he donated a hockey rink to Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, although some members of the faculty there deride ''Left Behind'' as science fiction. Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, has no such reservations. He considers the ''Left Behind'' books, in which the world comes to a violent end as Jesus triumphs over Satan, a ''compelling story written for nontheologians.''",

New York Theological Seminary announces with great sadness the passing on December 9, 2007, of Dr. Lowell W.

Dr. Livezey directed large studies of urban congregations, using ethnographic data assembled in collaboration with colleagues and students in Chicago, Boston, and New York. He argued that the ""religion factor"" is more salient than often recognized in the economic, demographic, and spatial restructuring of modern industrial cities. Dr. Livezey received the B.A. from Swarthmore College and the M. Th. and D. Min. degrees from the University of Chicago School of Divinity. He spent two decades in the peace movement before beginning his second career in studying communities, meanings, culture, and social change. In 2005, Dr. Livezey became the founding Director of the Ecologies of Learning Project (EOL) at NYTS, funded through a major grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. Lowell Livezey was a person of immense insight, wisdom and compassion, of great integrity and depth, and an outstanding colleague. He embodied the values of teaching, learning and research that lie at the heart of the scholarly endeavor. He also was a friend, a caring human being, someone around whom community was easily formed. In the language that is familiar to the people of faith, Lowell simply was a blessing to NYTS. Lowell helped us all understand the life and work of the churches and especially the intellectual task of preparation for ministry more clearly. Dr. Craig Dykstra, Senior Vice President, Religion of Lilly Endowment Inc., stated that ""Lowell Livezey's work on religion and urban culture is path-breaking -a permanent contribution.

And this realization -- that when you operate a gigantic fleet of vehicles, tiny improvements in the efficiency of each one will translate to huge savings overall -- is what led U.P.S. to limit further the number of left-hand turns its drivers make. The company employs what it calls a ''package flow'' software program, which among other hyperefficient practices involving the packing and sorting of its cargo, maps out routes for every one of its drivers, drastically reducing the number of left-hand turns they make (taking into consideration, of course, those instances where not to make the left-hand turn would result in a ridiculously circuitous route).",

In 1965, Jerry established the Tsai Management & Research Corporation and Manhattan Fund, which proved to be a huge success.

For instance, Ruth encouraged him to join Primerica, despite his reservations, and then backed his idea of acquiring Smith Barney. He often said that her faith in him have gave him the confidence to succeed. From 1993 to 1997, he served as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Delta Life Corporation, a life insurance; and annuity company.

She taught members of her family, her huge circle of friends and countless others that the meaning of life was not acquiring but giving. When one considers the range and scope of the charitable activities to which she was devoted, and the personal involvement and caring that she exhibited as a lay leader, one understands the definition of a true philanthropic role model. When one realizes the joy, happiness, peace of mind and healing that she helped to provide, the religious and secular knowledge she helped to foster, and the wonderful aesthetic sense that she brought to so many organizations and institutions, one begins to understand the depth of her persona.

He came to the United States in 1947 and, after one semester at Wesleyan University, transferred to Boston University, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the College of Liberal Arts and a Master of Arts in Economics from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1949. In addition, Jerry attended courses at the School of Management. Jerry began his distinguished investment career in 1951 as a security analyst at Bache & Company. A year later, he joined the Boston firm of Fidelity Management and Research Company, Inc., as a security analyst. After only six years, at the age of 29, he started the Fidelity Capital Fund, Fidelity's first public growth fund. He has been credited as one of the main initiators of the modern performance fund idea. At Fidelity he rapidly rose through the corporate ranks, ascending to Assistant Vice President of Fidelity Fund, Inc., to Vice President, to director and Executive Vice President of the company in 1963. In 1965, Jerry established the Tsai Management & Research Corporation and Manhattan Fund, which proved to be a huge success. The initial offering was planned for $25 million but the public's response was so enthusiastic that the fund was greatly oversubscribed and $247 million in shares were sold. He joined CNA Financial Corp in 1967 as President and served until 1973. Jerry was also Chairman of Associated Madison Companies, lnc., the cornerstone of Primerica's financial services business, He joined Primerica Corporation, then American Can Company, as Executive Vice President of financial services and as a member of the company's Board of Directors in 1982, when the company acquired Associated Madison in its first move into the financial services industry. He rose to Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, becoming the first ChineseAmerican to lead a company in the Dow Jones Industrials Index. He became the principal strategist in building Primerica's financial services businesses, which included the purchase of Smith Barney in 1987. Jerry was a devoted son, and regularly sought out his mother's advice before making a major business decision. For instance, Ruth encouraged him to join Primerica, despite his reservations, and then backed his idea of acquiring Smith Barney. He often said that her faith in him have gave him the confidence to succeed. From 1993 to 1997, he served as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Delta Life Corporation, a life insurance; and annuity company. Jerry also served on the boards of several companies, including United Rentals, lnc., Sequa Corp., Zenith National Insurance Corp., Triarc Companies, Inc. Apollo Investment Corp., and Saks Inc. In addition to his business successes Jerry was a highly distinguished member of the community serving on a variety of philanthropic boards including the Boston University Board of Trustees and the Norton Museum of Art Board of Trustees. He also served as a trustee of the New York University Medical Center and School of Medicine Foundation Board. He was a member of the Board of Overseers of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Jerry has been honored for his philanthropic and humanitarian work, receiving a Doctor of Humane Letters from Boston University in 2003. He received the Man of the Year Award from the Chinatown Planning Council of New York and the Boston University Alumni Award for Distinguished Public Service to the Profession in 1985.

An almost impossibly delicate vocalist, Lloyd was backed by soul that was modern and feather light, taking cues from the early 1980s, but with tougher edges. The album's high point was ''You,'' which employed a Spandau Ballet sample almost as aching as Lloyd himself and did some of the early work toward softening the future heartthrob Lil Wayne, who delivered one of his most romantic verses to date.",

Considered by many to be the greatest living artist, Bob Rauschenberg made artworks that reflected his boundless, enthusiastic appreciation of the fabric of daily life and his passionate curiosity about the world. As a young artist, he couldn't always afford new canvases but he couldn't stop painting either so he would make new paintings right over his old ones. He was a major innovator in the fields of painting, sculpture, dance and print making. Bob's muse and friend Illeana Sonnabend said of his art, ""There was a spiritual quality in his works, as well as a poetic and ephemeral quality. People like to hold on to what they know. Bob likes to shake them out of their habits."" He was incredibly generous and openhearted. He would cook fabulous dinners for 10 or 20 people and then invite everyone in range to eat. He approached life with a child's optimistic exuberance and was a dogged warrior for peace and the environment. Bob never turned his back on anyone in need. Bob is survived by his sister Janet Rauschenberg Begneaud and her husband, Byron, of Lafayette LA; son, Christopher Rauschenberg and his wife Janet Stein, of Portland OR; nephew Rick Begneaud; grandnephew, Dylan Rauschenberg Begneaud, grandniece, Logan Coleen Begneaud, all of Mill Valley CA, and friend and collaborator Darryl Pottorf of Captiva, FL. To commemorate Bob's long standing involvement in his community a memorial exhibition at the Bob Rauschenberg Gallery, Edison College, Fort Myers, FL will be planned and announced in the near future and a tribute to his art and life is being planned for New York, NY.

Through parental pressure and a desperate need to keep up with the rest of the material-driven world, students today place a much stronger emphasis on what they can gain from college, rather than what they can learn from their time at school. A college degree has always held a significant amount of weight in the job market, but in more recent years it has been seen as more of a requirement for those seeking employment in the professional workforce. In response, colleges have had to cater to a much larger and more diverse population of students, many of whom see college only as the next step to a career. The responsibility for the change in the institution of secondary education does not rest on the shoulders of the colleges themselves; like any other successful business, they are simply reacting to the wants of their consumers - who demand success, wealth, and power at a higher rate than ever before.",2007/09/24
