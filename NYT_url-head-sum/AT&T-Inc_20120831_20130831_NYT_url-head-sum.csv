Artist in life's endeavors large and small, his excellence as a father to Scott, Robb and Matthew shines above all. Devoted son of the late Leonard and Mary; brother of the late Roland; grandfather of Tabatha, Holliss, Fisher, Marilla and Holden; husband to Anne Holliss Young (divorced) and Rosana Pereira Lima (divorced); loyal friend to many. Born September 27, 1941 in New York City, he attended The Dalton School, Camp Kennebec (Maine) and Riverdale Country School, where he captained the football, basketball, and baseball teams. At Wesleyan University, he received the college's Best Athlete award as captain of the football and squash teams, was president of the Psi Upsilon fraternity, and elected to the Mystical Seven Honorary Society. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he began his career at Halle & Stieglitz - the Wall Street investment firm founded in 1889 by his great-grandfather Albert Stieglitz. While he remained an astute investor throughout his life, his private sector career focus was leadership training. He founded M.T.D. Associates, Inc., a management and financial consulting firm to leading banks and industrial companies including American Express, Chase Manhattan Bank, Conoco, DuPont, First Boston, GE, IBM, Johnson & Johnson and the Federal Reserve Bank of NY. Long associated with Boston's Forum Corporation, he received their award for excellence in the practice of management consulting. He dedicated much of his professional life to public service, first working on anti-poverty programs in NYC as staff assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay, and then working on U.S. foreign aid and development programs. At the State Department's Agency for International Development, stationed in Santiago, Chile, he coordinated the Overseas Private Investment Guarantee Program; at the Peace Corps in Washington, DC, he was Chief of the Programs and Training Division for Latin America; and at the School of International Training, The Experiment in International Living in Brattleboro, VT, he was the Director of the Graduate Degree Program in International Administration. Always willing to try new things - he traveled across Europe on motorcycle, climbed the Matterhorn, campaigned for NY State Assembly, drove a yellow cab, skied, and took up golf at the age of 50. As a late blooming artist, he followed his life-long passion for abstract painting; he studied intensively at The Art Students League of New York where he was awarded a merit scholarship. With genuine warmth, respect for others, integrity, hard work and an uplifting sense of humor throughout his life, he was blessed with an inner quality that enabled him to succeed in his wide range of endeavors, foremost as father and friend.

Mayer, and their five children, on Monday, March 18, 2013. Bob recently celebrated his 90th birthday, and would have celebrated his 65th wedding anniversary on May 1. Bob Friedman was born on February 6, 1923, to Genevieve (Jane) Mahank and John H. Friedman in Tiffin, OH. He was preceded in death by his sisters, Betty Jane and Rosalie Friedman, and Janie Congdon Stall. Bob was the leader of his own ten-piece jazz band, ""The Melodiers,"" while at Tiffin Columbian High School. Bob attended Case Western Reserve University where he was inducted into The Engineering Honor Society, Tau Beta Pi. Following his graduation from Case with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and attendance at Harvard Business School, Bob served as a Naval Officer aboard the Battleship Texas during World War II. After the war, Bob rose through the ranks of The National Machinery Company (National) in Tiffin, OH and became the President and Chief Executive Officer for almost three decades. During his tenure, National became not only the largest employer in Tiffin, but also the largest global manufacturer of hot and cold forging and forming machinery, capturing 52% of the world market. In 1958, Bob led the acquisition of J.G. Kayser Company in Nuremberg, Germany, establishing manufacturing and distribution for National in Europe. He also negotiated contracts with the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War, Fiat Motor Company in Italy, and Pratt & Whitney. Bob invented and received a patent for the first machine to stamp a seamless aluminum can as well as for the manufacture of the blades and buckets for jet engines. Under his leadership, National achieved widespread industry recognition and success as an early pioneer of profit-sharing, employee stock ownership and productivity bonus programs. During the past 43 years he maintained a deep and abiding love for those who had worked with him. Following his work at National the family relocated to Ft. Lauderdale, FL where stock portfolio analysis and management were his passion. Bob became the founding investor and served for over twenty years as Chairman of the Board of Direct Supply, Inc., the nation's largest supplier to the long term care industry. Bob also pursued composition of music and lyrics for over 100 songs which were performed or arranged by jazz greats including Joe Williams, Ray Brown, Louie Belson, Lou Rawls, Benny Carter, Ernestine Anderson, Marian McPartland, Carmen McRae, Billy May, Matty Matlock, Flip Phillips, Johnny Mercer and Quincy Jones, with many of whom he also developed lasting friendships. Joe Williams performed Bob's songs on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,"" and Quincy Jones included one of Bob's songs, ""A Tribute to Benny Carter,"" in his ""Best of Quincy Jones"" album. His music has been performed by the Milwaukee and Jacksonville Symphonies and also by the award-winning University of Miami Jazz Band. He was inducted into the Big Band Hall of Fame in Palm Beach, FL in 1992. Bob was most proud of his first song for his wife, ""Serenade to Genie,"" and the five songs he wrote for each of his children, ""Betty,"" ""Jenny,"" ""Mary,"" ""Jane"" and ""Bobby.â€ Bob and Genie believed themselves to have been blessed, and that with these successes came both the privilege and the obligation to share. Through The Robert G. Friedman Foundation, Bob and Genie shared their blessings with many, including the Institute for Civic Involvement at Pine Crest School, Holy Cross Hospital, Smith College, Northwestern University and Curious Kids Museum.

Lauderdale, FL, and formerly of Tiffin, OH, passed away peacefully in his home, surrounded by his loving family, including his wife of nearly 65 years, Eugenie S. Friedman; granddaughter of Oscar F. Mayer, and their five children, on Monday, March 18, 2013. Bob recently celebrated his 90th birthday, and would have celebrated his 65th wedding anniversary on May 1. Bob Friedman was born on February 6, 1923, to Genevieve (Jane) Mahank and John H. Friedman in Tiffin, OH. He was preceded in death by his sisters, Betty Jane and Rosalie Friedman, and Janie Congdon Stall. Bob was the leader of his own ten-piece jazz band, ""The Melodiers,"" while at Tiffin Columbian High School. Bob attended Case Western Reserve University where he was inducted into The Engineering Honor Society, Tau Beta Pi. Following his graduation from Case with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and attendance at Harvard Business School, Bob served as a Naval Officer aboard the Battleship Texas during World War II. After the war, Bob rose through the ranks of The National Machinery Company (National) in Tiffin, OH and became the President and Chief Executive Officer for almost three decades. During his tenure, National became not only the largest employer in Tiffin, but also the largest global manufacturer of hot and cold forging and forming machinery, capturing 52% of the world market. In 1958, Bob led the acquisition of J.G. Kayser Company in Nuremberg, Germany, establishing manufacturing and distribution for National in Europe. He also negotiated contracts with the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War, Fiat Motor Company in Italy, and Pratt & Whitney. Bob invented and received a patent for the first machine to stamp a seamless aluminum can as well as for the manufacture of the blades and buckets for jet engines. Under his leadership, National achieved widespread industry recognition and success as an early pioneer of profit-sharing, employee stock ownership and productivity bonus programs. During the past 43 years he maintained a deep and abiding love for those who had worked with him. Following his work at National the family relocated to Ft. Lauderdale, FL where stock portfolio analysis and management were his passion. Bob became the founding investor and served for over twenty years as Chairman of the Board of Direct Supply, Inc., the nation's largest supplier to the long term care industry. Bob also pursued composition of music and lyrics for over 100 songs which were performed or arranged by jazz greats including Joe Williams, Ray Brown, Louie Belson, Lou Rawls, Benny Carter, Ernestine Anderson, Marian McPartland, Carmen McRae, Billy May, Matty Matlock, Flip Phillips, Johnny Mercer and Quincy Jones, with many of whom he also developed lasting friendships. Joe Williams performed Bob's songs on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,"" and Quincy Jones included one of Bob's songs, ""A Tribute to Benny Carter,"" in his ""Best of Quincy Jones"" album. His music has been performed by the Milwaukee and Jacksonville Symphonies and also by the award-winning University of Miami Jazz Band. He was inducted into the Big Band Hall of Fame in Palm Beach, FL in 1992. Bob was most proud of his first song for his wife, ""Serenade to Genie,"" and the five songs he wrote for each of his children, ""Betty,"" ""Jenny,"" ""Mary,"" ""Jane"" and ""Bobby. Bob and Genie believed themselves to have been blessed, and that with these successes came both the privilege and the obligation to share. Through The Robert G. Friedman Foundation, Bob and Genie shared their blessings with many, including the Institute for Civic Involvement at Pine Crest School, Holy Cross Hospital, Smith College, Northwestern University and Curious Kids Museum.

And because Wall Street is a place where magic works, the market will recognize this, giving each of the separated companies a higher price.",

Mayer, and their five children, on Monday, March 18, 2013. Bob recently celebrated his 90th birthday, and would have celebrated his 65th wedding anniversary on May 1. Bob Friedman was born on February 6, 1923, to Genevieve (Jane) Mahank and John H. Friedman in Tiffin, OH. He was preceded in death by his sisters, Betty Jane and Rosalie Friedman, and Janie Congdon Stall. Bob was the leader of his own ten-piece jazz band, ""The Melodiers,"" while at Tiffin Columbian High School. Bob attended Case Western Reserve University where he was inducted into The Engineering Honor Society, Tau Beta Pi. Following his graduation from Case with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and attendance at Harvard Business School, Bob served as a Naval Officer aboard the Battleship Texas during World War II. After the war, Bob rose through the ranks of The National Machinery Company (National) in Tiffin, OH and became the President and Chief Executive Officer for almost three decades. During his tenure, National became not only the largest employer in Tiffin, but also the largest global manufacturer of hot and cold forging and forming machinery, capturing 52% of the world market. In 1958, Bob led the acquisition of J.G. Kayser Company in Nuremberg, Germany, establishing manufacturing and distribution for National in Europe. He also negotiated contracts with the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War, Fiat Motor Company in Italy, and Pratt & Whitney. Bob invented and received a patent for the first machine to stamp a seamless aluminum can as well as for the manufacture of the blades and buckets for jet engines. Under his leadership, National achieved widespread industry recognition and success as an early pioneer of profit-sharing, employee stock ownership and productivity bonus programs. During the past 43 years he maintained a deep and abiding love for those who had worked with him. Following his work at National the family relocated to Ft. Lauderdale, FL where stock portfolio analysis and management were his passion. Bob became the founding investor and served for over twenty years as Chairman of the Board of Direct Supply, Inc., the nation's largest supplier to the long term care industry. Bob also pursued composition of music and lyrics for over 100 songs which were performed or arranged by jazz greats including Joe Williams, Ray Brown, Louie Belson, Lou Rawls, Benny Carter, Ernestine Anderson, Marian McPartland, Carmen McRae, Billy May, Matty Matlock, Flip Phillips, Johnny Mercer and Quincy Jones, with many of whom he also developed lasting friendships. Joe Williams performed Bob's songs on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,"" and Quincy Jones included one of Bob's songs, ""A Tribute to Benny Carter,"" in his ""Best of Quincy Jones"" album. His music has been performed by the Milwaukee and Jacksonville Symphonies and also by the award-winning University of Miami Jazz Band. He was inducted into the Big Band Hall of Fame in Palm Beach, FL in 1992. Bob was most proud of his first song for his wife, ""Serenade to Genie,"" and the five songs he wrote for each of his children, ""Betty,"" ""Jenny,"" ""Mary,"" ""Jane"" and ""Bobby. Bob and Genie believed themselves to have been blessed, and that with these successes came both the privilege and the obligation to share. Through The Robert G. Friedman Foundation, Bob and Genie shared their blessings with many, including the Institute for Civic Involvement at Pine Crest School, Holy Cross Hospital, Smith College, Northwestern University and Curious Kids Museum. Bob was first and foremost a devoted husband; father and friend, whose loyalty and love were unsurpassed. Says his son, Robert T. Friedman, ""My Dad's many accomplishments are an inspiration to us all and his most enduring gift is the love he gave so freely and deeply to our family."" Bob Friedman is survived by his wife, Eugenie Steuer Friedman, and his children, Robert Taft Friedman of Chicago, IL, Elizabeth (Daniel) O'Connor of Fort Lauderdale, FL, Jennifer (Robert) Hillis of Milwaukee, WI, Mary (Douglas) Baske of Fort Lauderdale, FL, and Jane (Robert) Anspach of Perrysburg, OH; fifteen grandchildren (Eugenie (Kahlil) O'Connor, Elizabeth (Chris) Elsbury, Danny (Solidea) O'Connor, Catherine (Sean) Hough, Genevieve (Brian) Hillis, Bobby Hillis, Alison (Vance) Wiese, Adam (Abby) Baske, Emily (Fletcher) Reeves, Michael Anspach, Bobby Anspach, John Anspach, James Friedman, Will Friedman and Mary Friedman) and seven great-grandchildren (Jackson and Evelyn Reeves, Ava Wiese, Jack and Patrick Elsbury, Connor Hough and Elisa O'Connor). Bob Friedman's legacy is best summarized by his own words, as embodied in his song, ""God Bless You:"" God Bless You, with peace of mind. And help you see the thrill of being kind. God give you your faith again, And help you see the good in other men. And so will those who knew and loved him, will remember him.

Born in New York City on April 28, 1917, she was the daughter of Hortense LeBrun Cruger Parsons and Philip Rhinelander II. She attended Miss Hewitt's School in New York City and the Rosemary Hall School, then in Greenwich, CT. She was predeceased by her husband, William G. McKnight, Jr., in 1983 and by her brother, T.J. Oakley Rhinelander, in 1989. ""Brunie"" is survived by her sons, William G. McKnight III (Katherine Ewart) of New York City and Philip R. McKnight (Kathleen Lord) of Williamstown, MA, and three grandchildren, Serena McKnight Bowman, William Rhinelander McKnight and Sarah McKnight Burdick. She is also survived by nine great-grandchildren and two nieces, Jeannine R. Schoeffer and Serena Rhinelander. Brunie took great pride in her ancestors' ties to early Manhattan. Her mother was related to an early mayor of New York City, John Cruger (1678-1744), and to a prominent 19th century suffragette, Lucretia Mott (1793-1880). Her father's family, Philip and John Rhinelander, arrived in New York in about 1686, establishing farms around what is now 89th Street and the East River to feed lower Manhattan and then organizing a shipping company to import molasses from the Caribbean, converting the molasses to sugar at their sugar mill (established in 1763) on 23rd Street. They later founded the Rhinelander Real Estate Company, which eventually became one of the largest landholders in New York City. In 1848 the Company began to build blocks of row ""brownstone"" residences on the upper East and West Sides to meet the City's expanding housing needs. In 1900 it completed the construction of the landmark Rhinelander Mansion at 72nd Street and Madison Avenue. During her life Brunie was especially proud of her work as a Red Cross nurse's aide at Roosevelt Hospital during and after World War II and her lifelong support for many wildlife and animal (especially cats, which she simply adored) protection organizations. Brunie was widely loved and admired for her always positive but stoic attitude towards her family and life and for her sense of humor, which we will always treasure. She will be missed by her family and by her faithful and loyal caregivers in Southampton, Isadora Cooks and Norma Manangon, for whom her entire family is forever grateful. Contributions in memory of Brunie's love of all animals may be sent to the Animal Rescue Fund of the Hamptons, Inc., P.O. Box 901, Wainscott, New York 11975.
