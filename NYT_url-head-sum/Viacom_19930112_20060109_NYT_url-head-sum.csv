A1 Significant areas of Iraq are still not secure enough for citizens to vote, the commander of American ground forces there said. The acknowledgement came on a day when seven American soldiers were killed. The Iraqi government announced it was extending emergency rule in most areas of the country for 30 more days. A1 Paul A. Volcker says his investigation into the scandal-tainted oil-for-food program will clarify the roles of Secretary General Kofi Annan and the program's former director, Benon V. Sevan, but will not produce any ''smoking gun.'' A3 U.N. Focus on Relief Effort United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan gently prodded world leaders on how to coordinate the vast tsunami relief effort to follow through on their aid pledges, which now total more than $3 billion. Health officials are warning the death toll could still rise, unless a constant stream of assistance is maintained where poor sanitation and a lack of medical care and disease remain a threat. A12 The United States military's huge relief effort for tsunami victims is producing something of a political upheaval in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country: America is being praised, even by some of its harshest critics, while Arab countries are being questioned. A12 The tsunami also hit the eastern United States, though only the tide gauges noticed. The tsunami was so powerful that it swept around the world, with its last residual waves perceptibly jostling tide gauges from Russia's remote northeastern Pacific waters to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the Atlantic. A14 Congress passed legislation to allow taxpayers additional time to make cash donations to relief organizations addressing the disaster and claim a tax deduction for 2004. A12 SCIENCE/HEALTH A Genetic Link to AIDS A new study by researchers in Texas has found a strong link between a gene that codes part of the immune system and susceptibility to the virus that causes AIDS. A17 Mandela's Son Dies of AIDS Nelson Mandela, who has devoted much of his life after leaving South Africa's presidency to a campaign against AIDS, said his son had died of the disease. Mr. Mandela said he was disclosing the cause of his death to focus more public attention on AIDS, which is still a taboo topic among many South Africans. A3 NATIONAL A16-20 Nominee Says He Opposes Torture of Terror Suspects Alberto R. Gonzales, nominated by President Bush to be attorney general, denounced the use of torture against terrorism suspects and promised to abide by international law, even as he came under attack from lawmakers over the government's treatment of prisoners. A1 Tenet Cited for 9/11 Failures An internal investigation by the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that officials who served at the highest levels of the agency, should be held accountable for failing to allocate adequate resources to combat terrorism before the Sept. 11 attacks, current and former intelligence officials say. A1 Arrest in 1964 Murders The most infamous unresolved case from America's civil rights struggle -- the 1964 abduction and killing of three voter-registration volunteers in Mississippi -- was reopened with the arrest of Edgar Ray Killen, a longtime leader of the Ku Klux Klan, the authorities announced. A1 Retrial in Drowning Case Andrea Yates, a Texas woman convicted of drowning her five children in a bathtub, was granted a new trial by an appeals court in Houston. A16 Drug Campaign Called Unlawful The investigative arm of Congress said that the Bush administration had violated federal law by producing and distributing TV news segments about the harmful effects of drug use among young people. A16 Vote Challenged, Then Ratified Congress officially ratified President Bush's election victory, but not before Democrats challenged the electoral votes from Ohio. A19 Senator Oppose Bush Plan Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat whose support was essential to the enactment of President Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and his Medicare legislation in 2003, said he would oppose the president's Social Security plan this year. A19 Charges Dismissed in Spy Case A judge dismissed all charges against a Chinese-American woman accused of using a sexual relationship with an F.B.I. agent to secure national military documents. A20 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Assembly Wants Members To Be Present for Votes The New York State Assembly is adopting new rules requiring lawmakers to actually be present in the Capitol when they want to vote on bills.

B1 Tuition Stability at SUNY The chancellor of the State University of New York proposed sweeping changes in the way the university sets its tuition, guaranteeing that each class of entering students would not face tuition increases for four years, beginning next fall. B1 School Accountants Faulted A new state audit concludes that the accounting firm chosen by the Roslyn, N.Y., school district as its fiscal watchdog was hired without competitive bidding and failed to catch rampant multimillion-dollar corruption -- even after a whistle-blower's tip on thefts of $223,000.

PAGE B1 For Italians, a Need To Regain the Papacy For 455 years, the papacy passed uninterrupted from one Italian to another, until the election of the Polish pope, John Paul II. Now, after 26 years, many Italians think it is time to get back in office -- for fear that changes in the Roman Catholic Church may close the door on them for good. As cardinals from 52 countries prepare to select the next pope, some Vatican historians believe that the election of another foreigner would conclude a historic shift of power away from Italy. According to this school of thought, the papacy needs to mirror Catholicism's growth in the Southern Hemisphere.

A1 The White House said President Bush's dramatic early return from vacation was necessary to save the life of Terri Schiavo, but Republicans and religious figures said the move was also political: a powerful embrace of the ''culture of life'' issues of religious conservatives who helped him win the White House in 2004.

And though its overall aesthetic has changed many times over the years, MTV has always put a premium on a visual style with a graphic twist: still photography and video, combined with animation, collage and illustrated words. MTV Networks now consists of 100 channels around the world -- Comedy Central, VH1, CMT and Nickelodeon, among others -- and each has a design that is fundamental to attracting its desired audience, whether savvy fans of pop culture or 9-year-old admirers of Sponge Bob Squarepants. The most recent project -- and one of the most visible ever -- is the new logo for MTV2. Meant to introduce a faster-paced format, to court a young, male audience and in response to the music network Fuse, the image of the two-headed dog (above) was plastered all over New York City in a street marketing campaign that began in mid-January. MTV2 switched to its new logo -- and new programming -- at midnight on Feb. 7.",

But Mr. Kerry challenged the results in Ohio, and said he would not abandon his campaign until all the votes in that critical state are counted. A1 Many precincts in Ohio continued to accept voters long after they were supposed to close, delaying the count and leaving the state's critical electoral votes up in the air.

But for movie distributors and marketers, who must jockey for the best opening days and manufacture buzz among those most likely to show up on those days, this summer has been in play for months -- in some cases, even years. From the start of production to the annual exhibitor conventions to the publicity campaigns, the studios are in a war for opening-day supremacy. Based on conversations with studio executives, this chronology follows the strategic maneuvering that has been going on since June 30, 2003, when ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith'' began principal photography. June 30, 2003 -- Competitors check the calendar: a ''Star Wars'' epic usually takes two years to complete, and recent installments have opened the third weekend in May. Let the games begin. Aug. 20, 2003 -- ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' returns to the 20th Century Fox schedule, with a November start date, even after losing first Nicole Kidman (to a scheduling conflict) and then Brad Pitt. The reason? Angelina Jolie has committed to ''Mrs.,'' and Pitt is back on board to play ''Mr.'' Also this month: DreamWorks begins animating ''Madagascar,'' a computer-generated feature about shipwrecked zoo animals. Oct. 14, 2003 -- Columbia announces that Josh Lucas will star in ''Stealth,'' directed by Rob Cohen, with production beginning early in 2004. Already tentatively scheduled to open Memorial Day weekend of 2005, it's about stealth fighter pilots and technology run amok. The marketing begins immediately, according to Geoffrey Ammer, president for worldwide marketing at Sony's Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group. Looking for ''an iconic image'' for the print advertising, they come up with a shot of three dashing pilots -- Mr. Lucas, Jessica Biel and Jamie Foxx -- striding toward the viewer with a stealth fighter looming behind them. December 2003 -- ''Madagascar'' chooses a release date -- in industry-speak, ''plants the flag'': Memorial Day weekend 2005. January 2004 -- Sony now claims a different date, July 29, 2005, for ''Stealth.'' Feb. 17, 2004 -- ''The Longest Yard,'' a remake of the 1974 football-in-prison movie, is set for production July 20, with Paramount distributing domestically and Sony internationally. It will star Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Snoop Dogg, other current rappers, former N.F.L. players and, eventually, Burt Reynolds, who starred in the original. Will they be marketing the cast, or are they casting for the market? Both. April 5, 2004 -- Lucasfilm announces the ''Star Wars III'' release date: May 19, 2005. Fox, which is its distributor, now must position its own ''Fantastic Four,'' a live-action adaptation of the Marvel comic book series. It chooses July 1 --a long holiday weekend means a bigger opening. A film shown on more than 3,000 screens earns an average of 31.6 percent of its total domestic box office during its first weekend, and a big opening increases ''must-see'' urgency for the coming weeks. Paramount will soon claim Memorial Day for ''The Longest Yard,'' and with a different target audience it may thrive opposite ''Madagascar.'' But Chris Rock plays one of the animals in ''Madagascar'' -- in ''Longest Yard,'' he will be competing against his own voice. July 22-25, 2004 -- Comic-Con International, in San Diego, the major event of the year for comic book and fantasy aficionados. Movie marketers know they can use its passionate audience of Internet-savvy fans to start buzz -- hopefully positive -- about coming films. Fox shows off the director and the newly announced cast of ''Fantastic Four,'' while Warner Brothers is quickly dissed online for not providing a sneak peek of ''Batman Begins,'' which is already in production. Two weeks later, the director, Christopher Nolan, will make a surprise appearance at another convention, Wizard World Chicago, and show two minutes of the film. Aug. 11, 2004 -- ''Mission: Impossible 3,'' starring Tom Cruise, was originally scheduled for May 2004; then it was postponed, first to May 2005, then to June 29, 2005 -- all before losing its director over ''creative differences'' and without being scheduled for production. Now Paramount and DreamWorks greenlight a Steven Spielberg remake of the classic H.G. Wells novel ''War of the Worlds,'' starring -- yes, Tom Cruise. ''Mission'' is pushed back indefinitely, and ''War of the Worlds'' plants the flag on June 29, 2005. ''Fantastic Four'' and ''War of the Worlds'' are both high-concept films with presold titles, but going head to head on the Fourth of July weekend could mean disappointing box-office revenue. Will someone in this game of chicken swerve? Aug. 23, 2004 -- With the start of production on ''Fantastic Four,'' publicity ratchets up. James N. Gianopulos, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, described it as a gradual process: ''revealing a film's elements as you'd peel an onion.'' To generate -- and control -- publicity, films typically limit on-set access to favored outlets, particularly those with vast audiences, like ''Entertainment Tonight'' or ''Access Hollywood.'' Fox, however, invites a large contingent of reporters to the set of ''Fantastic Four'' midproduction, to demonstrate Michael Chiklis's daily transformation into the Thing. Nov. 7, 2004 -- After a mere 12 weeks of preproduction, ''War of the Worlds'' -- a complex special-effects film -- begins shooting with less than half the lead time of ''Star Wars III.'' Nov. 19, 2004 -- Sony sends out the teaser trailer for ''Bewitched,'' starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell, in time for exhibitors to attach it to Paramount/Nickelodeon's ''SpongeBob SquarePants Movie.'' At 30 to 45 seconds, instead of a standard trailer's two and a half minutes, a teaser introduces the film's main concept and announces the release season or date. ''On branded properties, an early impression is important,'' said Jeff Blake, vice chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. ''But with special effects films, it's hard.'' Mr. Ammer said that the trailer is the most important element of movie advertising, because ''the audience is 100 percent moviegoers.'' The poster, called the one-sheet, goes to theaters at the same time as the trailer. Dec. 9, 2004 -- The teaser-trailer for ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (Warner Brothers, July 15) has its premiere on MTV's ''TRL.'' Jan. 7, 2005 -- Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston separate, after months of tabloid Pitt-Jolie rumors from the set of ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith.'' Any overt exploitation of the offstage drama for publicity purposes, however, could result in ''blowback,'' unintended negative consequences that contradict the old adage that any publicity is good publicity. Feb. 6, 2005 -- Super Bowl Sunday. The studios pay $2.4 million each for 30-second ads for ''The Longest Yard'' (Paramount, May 27); ''Batman Begins'' (Warner Brothers, June 15); and ''War of the Worlds'' (Paramount, June 29). Feb. 7, 2005 -- Paramount gets some quick bang for its big Super Bowl bucks: Fox blinks and reschedules ''Fantastic Four'' for July 8, out of direct competition with the opening of ''War of the Worlds,'' but up against ''Bewitched.'' In its new position, ''Fantastic Four'' could cut into the second-weekend grosses for ''War.'' Week of March 6, 2005 -- Sony moves ''Bewitched'' out of the cluttered July 8 weekend to June 24. Fox attaches the trailer of ''Star Wars III'' to its big spring animated movie, ''Robots,'' and also shows the full-length trailer on its television hit ''The O. C.'' Mr. Blake, of Sony, said, ''You like to attach a trailer to one of your own films, and get exhibitors to attach it to your competitors' films.'' Also this week, DreamWorks screens portions of ''Madagascar'' for press and exhibitors, getting a jump on the promotional clutter of the following week's ShoWest convention -- which will still include a special ceremony honoring Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks. (See accompanying article.) Week of March 21, 2005 -- The chess moves continue: Paramount moves its ''Bad News Bears'' remake to July 22 from June 10, where it would have pitted Billy Bob Thornton against his ex-wife, Ms. Jolie. April 2, 2005 -- A new line of Star Wars III toys joins the recently released Darth Tater. DreamWorks is on the case too: Ben Stiller, one of the ''Madagascar'' voices, is host of Nickelodeon's ''Kids' Choice Awards.'' Johnny Depp, star of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,'' is honored, Nick style, by being slimed. April 7, 2005 -- Paramount begins weekly press screenings of ''The Longest Yard'' in New York and Los Angeles, including one for the sports press covering the N.F.L. draft. Viewers of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament in March have seen commercials, and so will viewers of the N.B.A. finals. The rapper Nelly appears in the film, produced the soundtrack and performs the lead single -- bait for fans of MTV, which is, like Paramount, a Viacom company. April 8, 2005 -- Sony takes over MGM and immediately moves MGM's ''Pink Panther,'' starring Steve Martin and Kevin Kline, from September to Aug. 5, a week ahead of its own ''Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,'' meant to offer adolescent males a last blast of humor before school resumes. The Aug. 5 competition is ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' (Warner Brothers), which itself has been moved from June 24, and ''Doom'' (Universal), based on the video game. Universal soon pushes ''Doom'' to Oct. 21. April 21-24, 2005 -- Star Wars Celebration III fan convention, in Indianapolis. George Lucas appears, along with costumed fans living their epic dream, just in time to ramp up ''Star Wars'' awareness before the opening. May 2005 -- Sweeps month on television. Look for movie ads during season finales and other highly promoted shows. Warner Brothers will broadcast eight minutes of ''Batman Begins'' on WB during ''Smallville.'' And what's this? George Lucas again, appearing this time in an episode of Fox's series ''The O.C.'' Days before May 19 -- ''Star Wars'' fans will line up and camp overnight across the country, while at the Cannes Film Festival, ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith'' will be screened out of competition. George Lucas can again be counted on to be there. Coming Months -- Lavish premieres -- and the attendant print and television coverage -- will precede the openings of high-profile films. Future Years -- The biggest weekends of 2006 and 2007 have already been claimed by the studios. Expect changes. Wooing the Toughest Crowd: The Movie-Theater Owners THE single most important marketing tool for summer movies is ShoWest, the annual trade show that draws movie-theater owners from around the world to Las Vegas. Held this year from March 14 through 17, ShoWest is as much carnival as trade show. Movie distributors spend lavishly on hoopla -- parties, stars and booze -- in the hope that theater owners will temporarily forget that their financial interests and those of the studios are not identical. Theaters rent films for certain guaranteed periods in exchange for a share of the total ticket sales. On opening weekend -- and perhaps the second weekend of a big picture -- the split is 70 percent to the distributor and 30 percent to the exhibitor. The studio's share declines by 10 percent each week: first to 60 percent, then to 50 and 40, until it levels out at 30 to 35 percent for as long as the theater keeps the film. The studio wants a film to open huge, even if it doesn't last long. Theaters, which earn much of their revenue from concession sales, prefer movies that will run all summer to full houses, with the theater ultimately taking 65 percent of ticket sales. The sales pitches are endlessly inventive. Paramount's booth on the trade-show floor is a one-and-a-half-story house. An LCD screen in the living room promotes ''Elizabethtown,'' a coming-of-age romance directed by Cameron Crowe. Paramount has had it scheduled for July 29, in the midst of the summer crush and up against ''Stealth''; now it is pushed back to October. A late scheduling change sometimes means that there are problems, but the ''Elizabethtown'' maneuver, according to Robert G. Friedman, Paramount's chief operating officer, is meant ''to move it closer to awards season.'' Next, living-room visitors are hurried down into the basement of the house by a frantic actor waving a flashlight and talking about danger. The basement's screen presents Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg pitching ''War of the Worlds'' (June 29), along with an impressive sneak peek at the film's story and special effects. For the ShoWest Schmooze-a-Rama buffet lunch, competing studios have installed a dozen or so ''experiential branding'' setups in the ballroom. Priority goes to Sony's ''Stealth,'' with a mock-up of the nose section of a stealth fighter against a backdrop painted with the wings. Exhibitors can don fighter-pilot shirts for a photograph that mimics the poster. A half-dozen other photo-ops mean that the exhibitors' vacation albums will be filled with snapshots meant to remind them of coming films. The convention crowds, who seem preoccupied with food, photo-ops and gift bags of promotional items, are nevertheless scrutinizing the product reels with a practiced, professional sense of what will play in, for example, Sheboygan, Wis. There, the Marcus chain owns the only theater in the county. The manager of its 13 screens, Dennis Udovich, said, ''The smaller indie films never play there unless they've been successful elsewhere, like 'Napoleon Dynamite.''' Mr. Udovich said that ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' (Fox, June 10) ''could do some business. It looks cute. There's chemistry'' between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The Sony show-and-tell evening culminates in an hourlong sneak peek at ''Stealth.'' The filmmakers have spent six weeks preparing an excerpt -- high-tech, high-energy and high-explosive -- to persuade exhibitors to buy a film without a presold brand name. Sony follows the ''Stealth'' screening with a flashy 70's-inspired disco extravaganza. The Fox presentation is invaded by the ''Star Wars'' Imperial Army and Darth Vader, who introduces George Lucas, followed by eight minutes of the new feature. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, looking both fabulous and uncomfortable, present a clip from ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith,'' about married assassins ordered to kill each other. ShoWest concludes with an awards ceremony. Everyone honored -- is this a surprise? -- has a film coming up. CAROL AMES",

A study to be released today by the Los Angeles-based labor union shows that members of minorities currently make up less than 10 percent of employed writers in the movie and television industry, even though nonwhites constitute more than 30 percent of the American population. A 3 percent rise in the number of minority writers employed from 1998 to 2004 is mainly due to the success of African-American themed television shows on networks like Viacom's UPN, the study shows. In the film industry, the number of minority screenwriters has been stuck at about 6 percent since 1999. Women have made slight advances in their share of writing jobs, increasing from 23 percent in 1998 to 25 percent in 2004, mostly in television. Both women and members of minorities continue to earn less than their white, male counterparts for similar work, the study says, and the gap has grown in recent years, from an average of $8,500 in 1998 to $18,000 in 2004 in median income.

Transactions similar to the Macmillan purchase were frequent in the 1980's, when medium-sized publishers bought small publishers, only to be bought by large media conglomerates. At the time, people in the industry were predicting that when the smoke cleared, only a handful of publishers would be left standing.",1993/11/15

The disclosure was made by Herbert Wachtell of the Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm, which is representing QVC Network Inc. in its case against Paramount in Delaware Chancery Court here. QVC Network is arguing that Paramount illegally spurned its $10.6 billion bid in favor of a less attractive offer from Viacom Inc. QVC's lawyer used the July offer to strengthen its case that Paramount had put itself up for sale after learning that QVC might make a hostile bid. QVC Seeks to Prove a Sale Proving a sale is crucial to QVC's efforts to get the court to eliminate anti-takeover provisions and the consolation prizes that Paramount has promised to pay Viacom if it loses.

""I'M NOT in the cable business,"" insists Glenn R. Jones, chairman and chief executive of Jones Intercable Inc., Jones Spacelink Ltd., Jones International Ltd. and Mind Extension University. ""I'm in the business of extending the human mind."" Certainly, Mr. Jones, 63, is not your everyday cable executive. The owner of 23-year-old Jones Intercable, the country's seventh-largest cable operator, which owns or manages 44 cable systems serving 1.4 million subscribers in California, New York and 18 other states, sees himself as a visionary pioneer on the information highway, an entrepreneur/ risk-taker, a poet of technology. He works from a high-tech headquarters in Denver. And he reads voraciously, cites science fiction easily and writes books and poetry (as Yankee Jones). Like Ted Turner, Mr. Jones is also producing his own programming. In 1989, he founded the Jones Entertainment Group, which produced the current release ""Household Saints."" And like other cable moguls, Mr. Jones has recently seen his wealth ballooning -- Intercable's shares are up nearly 70 percent since May, trading at around $17 last week -- as Wall Street has become bullish on cable's role in the future delivery of home entertainment. Witness Bell Atlantic's deal for Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator, and the battle between Viacom and QVC Network for Paramount Communications. Indeed, Intercable and Spacelink themselves may merge to help attract a partnership deal or capital from Pacific Telesis or Bell Canada. ""The entertainment business,"" Mr. Jones says, ""impacts the human mind, which is the determination point of the electronic highway. The brain is a three-pound electrochemical device that cooks along at about 25 watts, mostly glucose. It's really the world's first computer."" Mr. Jones's mix of management philosophy and technological jargon suggests a cross between Carl Sagan and Ross Perot. To keep up with the latest ideas, Mr. Jones often buys $500 worth of books at a time and stuffs them into three backpacks, keeping one in the office, one on his five-seater jet and one in the trunk of his white Mercedes. At his Frank Lloyd Wright-style home in Denver, he just finished reading a biography of Jefferson and has started one on John Paul Jones. ""Those people,"" he said, ""talked about the idea of individual freedom and the concept of self-government -- a delicate, tenuous experiment still going on because it was based on having an informed electorate, which brings you right into education. Our democracy needs to become more electronic."" The education of America is Mr. Jones's passion. He has lavished some $30 million on his Mind Extension University since he founded it in 1987 to provide college classes -- with credit -- by cable. This type of education, he said, would not have worked before the advent of the VCR, with its taping capabilities. Right now, 25.5 million subscribers to basic cable systems that carry the MEU channel can watch classes for free, but those seeking credit must enroll at one of the 26 universities. The schools, which charge MEU students less than the full cost of actually attending class, include the University of California at Berkeley, George Washington University, the University of Maryland and Colorado State. Currently, Mr. Jones said, 36,000 students are enrolled in at least one course. Linda Roberts, special adviser on technology for the United States Education Department, gives Mr. Jones credit for being on the cutting edge of the information highway. ""Mind Extension University is a very important example of how we can use today's technological systems, whether cable or interactive fiber,"" she said. While he is proud of his educational mission, Mr. Jones is a bit defensive about MEU's for-profit status as well as its current lack of profits. ""It is a legitimate purpose of the private sector to focus upon and help resolve the intractable problems of our culture,"" he insisted. He added: ""I'm taking the risks. And it's un-American for me not to make a profit somewhere down the line -- about three years."" Mr. Jones is used to being called crazy -- like a fox. ""We started small when people didn't understand the limited partnership concept"" in acquiring cable systems, he said, ""so we had to form our own securities company. We raised $152,000 with the first limited partnership, then started raising $33 million and $55 million at a clip. It was un-American at the time, but it became mainstream when I raised $200 million. Since 1972, we've raised $1.3 billion in capital. We have 170,000 limited partners."" In many ways, Mr. Jones is already living the future. Of the company's 3,600 employees in the Denver area, 350 work in the suburb of Englewood in a glass office building with a helicopter pad. Fiber-optic and coaxial cables snake under the floors. Mr. Jones's circular office has 16 television sets and a computer that can manipulate several satellite dishes. At the center of the building is an atrium, featuring a big reflecting pool with an island. In a ceremony in the atrium each year, Mr. Jones honors one of his employees for a job well done. The employee receives the award on the island as colleagues watch and bagpipes play. ""There's a lot of poetry in business,"" Mr. Jones said. ""Hard as it is.""",1993/11/21

Three years ago, the only place any sensibly greedy Hollywood studio would look for a buyer or for backing was Japan. After all, in 1989 Sony paid $3.4 billion for Columbia Pictures, owner of the Columbia and Tri-Star studios, and in 1990 Matsushita paid $6.1 billion for MCA, owner of Universal Studios -- still the biggest-ever Japanese takeover in America.",1993/11/26

He would complain publicly and frequently about being the prisoner of a single role and an unchanging formula, but the money and the power, which he wielded with aplomb, proved irresistible. He died at 76 in September, his last performing effort devoted to still another ""Perry Mason"" case, part of a series of periodic two-hour features carried on NBC since 1985. Tonight's ""Perry Mason: The Case of the Killer Kiss"" involves, appropriately enough, a gaggle of soap-opera denizens, one of them murdered, the rest suspects. Created in a series of best-selling novels by Erle Stanley Gardner, the lawyer and author, the defense lawyer Perry Mason moved on to radio in 1943 where, for 12 years, five days a week, he was a character in a series that was part soap opera, part detective story. When that series was adapted in 1956 for television as the afternoon soap ""The Edge of Night,"" the characters were given new names. The name Perry Mason was reserved for the Raymond Burr weekly series that would run until 1966. ""The Killer Kiss"" hews to basic cookie-cutter form. Several characters are brought together, in this instance working on a soap opera. One is always abrasive or worse, and he or she will wind up the murder victim. The police pounce on a prime suspect, who often turns out to have some acquaintance with Perry Mason (""Her father was a judge,"" he will casually explain, ""her mother a law clerk""). He takes the case, begins his investigation and, by the time of trial, everyone in the immediate vicinity is looking suspicious. His devoted secretary, Della Street, played from the beginning by Barbara Hale, can always be depended on for some motherly hovering. In increasing pain over the years from assorted ailments, the rather massive Mr. Burr is almost always sitting or leaning on some sturdy prop. The trial unfolds with the inevitability of Greek drama. Viewers are assured of a tidy beginning, middle and end. The prosecuting attorney opens with overweening confidence but, inasmuch as Perry Mason has lost only one trial over all these years -- in 1963, and only because his client refused to enter evidence that would save her -- viewers are hardly in doubt about the outcome. Even the judges, apparently awed by basso-voiced authority, are prone to give Perry Mason unusual courtroom leeway. And when the lawyer's investigative assistant rushes into the courtroom with the latest piece of uncovered evidence, it's only a matter of minutes before the true culprit blurts out something like: ""He was going to take it all. I couldn't let him do that."" Tonight's final installment, starring a slew of real soap-opera actors, doesn't miss a well-worn trick. Like Eugene O'Neill's father doomed to playing the Count of Monte Cristo for much of his professional career, Raymond Burr may well have felt suffocated by the role of Perry Mason. The problem is that Mr. Burr did it to perfection, even when on automatic pilot. For a while in the early 1970's, he did some wheelchair sleuthing as ""Ironside,"" but that was just riding on Perry Mason's coattails. CBS tried to revive the ""Perry Mason"" series in 1973 with Monte Markham in the title role. No way. Mr. Burr had put a lock on the property. The actor and the role were bonded forever. It's one way, and certainly not the worst, to live the always precarious life of a performer.

In Michigan last week, the three ideas converged with a vengeance. Shattering the traditional method of financing public education, the state voted to shift most of the burden from property taxes to sales taxes. It will also triple the cigarette tax, to 75 cents a pack, to help pay the bills. Together, these taxes will raise about $2 billion. A key goal of the plan is to smooth out the disparities among school districts. The poorest now pay $3,200 per student each year, while the richest pay $10,400 (that's nothing compared with New York, though, where the high is close to $46,000).

For one thing, the lag between a politician's moment in history and the subsequent book is often ample for the public to forget the person or lose interest. For another, publishers are so susceptible to famous people -- even if the people are famous simply because they did some relatively minor thing during some administration or other -- that they often pay too high an advance, print too many copies and end up with too many unsold books. ""It is indeed a tough judgment call, and we've all made mistakes,"" said Caroline K. Reidy, president and publisher of Simon & Schuster's adult trade division. But this month, publishers who bet lots of money on books by politicians have good reason to be pleased with themselves.

Consumer confidence eased for the second month in August, and the housing market is still heading down -- as people kick themselves for missing those rock-bottom mortgage rates. As for the unemployment rate, it's coasting along at 6.1 percent -- about where it's been for four months after plunging early in the year. But the slowing trend showed up in a report that just 179,000 payroll jobs were added in August -- fewer than expected. And inflation? Nowhere on the horizon: average hourly earnings rose just 2 cents last month -- nothing to set off a spending spree. Given all this, it seems unlikely that the Federal Reserve will feel the need to raise interest rates again at its policy meeting this month. But you never know.",1994/09/04

W. Griffith had a Hollywood-shaking idea -- get together some people who know movies and let them run the show. United Artists was born. Since those glory days, though, corporations and committees and accountants have taken over -- and their movies, alas, often look the part. But last week a grand cycle came round again as three men who indisputably know movies now -- Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen -- joined forces to create a studio. The rest of Hollywood may soon look as if a ""Jurassic Park"" dinosaur had tromped through. Mr. Spielberg will stop making films for Universal, Mr. Katzenberg will probably raid the animation talent at Disney, his former home, Mr. Geffen will bring his production unit. And all that talent will flow to the new studio. A Novel Cash-Flow Problem Every company should have such problems. Chrysler -- yes, the one that almost went under -- has been making so much money it's running out of mattresses to stuff it in. With buyers clamoring for its cars and Cherokees, its earnings reports are getting boring -- another quarter, another record. And again last week: $11.66 billion in revenues, $651 million in profits, both records. So, what to do with it? The company even has all it needs in its pension funds -- the first time since 1957. It could raise the dividend, it could buy back some stock. But it also hasn't forgotten how wet the rainy days can be. The Car-Buying Minuet What is it about new cars? When you buy anything else, you shop around, you find the best price, you pay it. Simple. (Or you don't shop around, you pay too much, you kick yourself.) With cars, though, a bizarre world has evolved -- meaningless price tags, complex formulas for figuring what the price should be and the dealer's profit. (But do you know the deli's profit on that bagel and coffee?) And then ""no haggle"" pricing, to make it all nice and simple. But nothing, of course, is simple -- last week it turned out that the Justice Department is investigating the whole idea of no-haggle pricing. What are they looking for? Price-fixing possibly. Or maybe, like the rest of us, they're just trying to figure out what's going on. Lutece Super-Value Meals? The bistros come and go, the temples of Tuesday's cuisine vanish by Wednesday. And then there's Lutece, as indestructible as the Brooklyn Bridge. But the bridge shook a bit last week: Andre Soltner sold Lutece. So is it any cause for alarm that the buyer, Ark Restaurants, owns less-illustrious establishments like Albuquerque Eats and B. Smith's? No, insists Ark's president; this pillar of French cuisine will remain intact. But -- a ""but"" always seems to sneak in about now -- ""there may be room for enhancement,"" he said, like a ""Lutece Brasserie somewhere."" Stay off the Brooklyn Bridge. Toys Don't Kill? Think Again Kids love toy guns; parents hate them. So guess who usually wins out: Toy guns were a $246 million business in this country last year. But parents' vague unease has turned to tangible fear lately, as one New York boy, then another, was shot by a police officer who mistook a toy gun for the real thing. Toys 'R' Us heard those shots loud and clear, and last week it said it would stop selling ""realistic"" toy guns; others, like Kay-Bee Toys, quickly followed suit. Toys 'R' Us had banished toy guns before, but later started selling guns in bright colors -- to mark them as fake. But kids started painting them to look real, so the issue exploded again. Microsoft, On Top Again Microsoft clearly intends to be master of everything it touches, and if it can't build what it needs, it won't hesitate to buy it. Its own personal-finance software has managed only 4 percent of the market. But Bill Gates probably can't even see numbers that small, so last week, he had Microsoft issue $1.5 billion in stock -- in the largest software acquisition ever -- to buy Intuit, whose Quicken software owns the market. So if more people take to writing checks and paying bills electronically, Microsoft could just tiptoe in with a tiny transaction fee, then gather those golden crumbs into quite a rich cake indeed. ECONOMY Making Economics a Game There's a concept in economics called ""perfect competition"" -- the idea that businesses and nations exist in a vast state of nature, and the fittest will prevail by brute, faceless mathematical force. Some economists, though, think it's a bit murkier -- that something called ""game theory"" must be factored in. That theory takes into account the bluff and swagger, the backing and filling, of real-life competition -- a world, in short, in which rivals play a lot of ""games,"" possibly devious ones. Last week this economic school got a powerful blessing when the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded to three game-theory pioneers. Lilco as Politics? Don't Be Silly There's been talk of a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company for years, especially during the Shoreham mess. But it's naturally just a coincidence that Governor Cuomo proposed a takeover just last week -- a few weeks before his charmed political life could skid to a halt. Certainly it's not politics -- though the takeover would, by the by, lower rates for Lilco customers, among the nation's highest, by about 10 percent. George Pataki -- possibly munching some sour grapes as he witnessed, in living color, the joys of incumbency -- called it ""the height of political opportunism."" But Mr. Cuomo insisted it was ""for the public."" Follow the Bouncing Subsidy One way to get cheap magazine subscriptions is to accept a cut-rate offer, not renew, then take another introductory offer. Companies could probably play that game, too, hopping from New York to Connecticut and back, following the tax break du jour. Last week, angry that Swiss Bank had been lured to Stamford, Mayor Giuliani started talking tough, saying that a 1991 tristate peace treaty had been broken and he'd start trying to entice companies away from Connecticut. New York, in fact, has just offered Viacom $15 million in tax breaks to stick around. Of course, as a Connecticut official pointed out, the whole region gets hurt by this tax-draining game. No Inflation for Retirees Don't mention inflation to people getting Social Security; there's none of it in their paychecks. When the consumer price numbers came in on Friday, the yearly increase added up to just 2.8 percent -- and that instantly became the magic number for 1995 Social Security increases. But for all that talk about lurking inflation, that's the third-smallest increase since the payments were pegged to price rises two decades ago. And the consumer-price data came on top of a surprising decline in producer prices reported the day before -- so, yet again, that feared price pressure isn't showing up on any radar. INTERNATIONAL A Weak Link: The Ruble Russia's on a tightrope. It has to get its economy moving, but if it tries to do so by overdoing subsidies to business, the resulting inflation will be as destructive as anything else. Last week it took quite a jolt on that tightrope, as currency markets suddenly had big doubts and sent the ruble plummeting by 25 percent against the dollar -- its biggest single drop ever. Russia had made big strides in taming inflation, but this could well send it back to the drawing board. Boris Yeltsin started talking about conspiracies, and heads rolled -- Mr. Yeltsin fired the acting Finance Minister. But it was really just the market, and speculators, at work. The central bank managed to get the ruble to bounce back the next day, but that by no means meant the crisis was over. That was clear on Friday when the head of the central bank resigned. What Now for Mexican Labor? So now that Nafta has been around a while, what's in store for workers at American-owned plants in Mexico? An answer may be taking shape. With Mexican factory workers lucky to get $16 a day -- about what Americans get an hour -- American unions have been trying to address that disparity. But there have been charges that companies like Honeywell and General Electric have fired union sympathizers, so the unions turned to Labor Secretary Robert Reich to ride to the rescue. But last week Mr. Reich refused to pursue the complaints. And union organizers and companies alike were watching it all very closely.",1994/10/16

Rising rates hurt bondholders -- and a California county. A big brokerage firm learned its ace bond trader wasn't really trading. And arithmetic tripped up computers and money managers alike. On with the awards! By Floyd Norris. Consumer Deception Award To Intel, which discovered in July that its Pentium computer chip has a small problem -- it sometimes messes up long division problems that a smart fifth-grader could handle. Instead of disclosing the bug, Intel went on promoting the chip as the best on the market. It fell to Thomas R. Nicely, a professor in Virginia, to let the rest of us know. Foreign Aid Award To CS First Boston and Lehman Brothers. Between them, they raised $958 million by selling stock in two electric utilities that had been owned by the Chinese Government. Neither found much interest among investors, although the underwriters presumably made friends in Beijing. By Christmas, the value of the stock was down to $709 million. Mr. Magoo Award To General Electric, which reported hundreds of millions in false profits from its Kidder Peabody brokerage firm, only to belatedly figure out that its top trader, Joseph Jett, was recording nonexistent trades. 19th Hole Award To L. Glenn Orr, the outgoing chairman and chief executive of the Southern National Corporation, a North Carolina bank holding company. Forced to leave as part of a merger deal, Mr. Orr, 54, negotiated a deal that will pay his country club dues for life. Otherwise, he might have had to pay greens fees out of the $1.66 million-a-year salary that he is also to get for life. Should he die before his wife, she would get the cash for the rest of her life, but have to pay her own club dues. Gunsmoke Only Award To Smith & Wesson, the gun maker, for promising in help-wanted ads to provide a ""smoke-free workplace."" Neighborhood Leader Award To Burton Lifland, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the Macy's case. Although no party had raised the issue, he ordered Macy to keep its July 4 fireworks on Manhattan's East Side, not far from his apartment. Mark to Theory Award To David Askin of Askin Capital Management, who figured his computers knew more than the markets did. So he told investors the mortgage derivative securities his firm owned were worth what the model said, not what bidders were willing to pay. By the time investors found out what was really going on, most of the capital was gone. Brooklyn Bridge Award To Marion Merrell Dow, which claimed it had invested with Askin after being promised that it could earn 15 percent a year with virtually no risk. Arthur in Wonderland Award To Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. After the Financial Accounting Standards Board caved in to political pressure and abandoned an effort to force companies to recognize the expense of stock options given to executives, Mr. Levitt praised the F.A.S.B.'s ""great courage."" Lemon Underwriter Award To Merrill Lynch and Rauscher Pierce Refnes. In June, after interest rates had begun to leap, Rauscher Pierce underwrote $200 million in bonds so that school districts in Orange County, Calif., could put extra money in the county's investment fund. A month later, Merrill did the same for $600 million in county notes. No one noticed that the fund -- highly leveraged and stuffed full of securities whose value dropped as rates rose -- was losing money at a rapid rate. A few months later the fund's woes threw the county into bankruptcy. Sure Thing Award To A. Lorne Weil, chairman and chief executive of the Autotote Corporation, a supplier of gambling equipment. Using a derivative called an equity swap, he effectively sold 500,000 shares of Autotote for $26.78 a share -- but in a way that dodges capital gains taxes and keeps the votes for himself. By late December, the stock price was just above $13. Penny Stock Award To M. H. Meyerson & Company, a penny stock peddler that went public by issuing -- what else? -- a penny stock. Those who got in on the offering, at $4 for a share and a warrant, and got out quickly, doubled their money. But within a few months the package sold for under $2. Name Change Award To Repossession Auction, a peddler of used cars, which sought to cash in on the casino stock craze. It changed its name to Latin American Casinos and announced plans to put slots in Peru. Top Bargainer Award To Sumner M. Redstone, chairman of Viacom Inc., who ignored advice to sweeten the terms of Viacom's offer for Blockbuster Entertainment. Viacom's stock price plunged after it won the battle to buy Paramount Communications, making the deal with Blockbuster look like it would never get shareholder approval. He sat tight, the Viacom share price rallied and Viacom got Blockbuster on the original terms. Bottom Bargainer Award To David Mathis of the Kemper Corporation. He fought bitterly when General Electric tried to buy his company just as its performance was souring. In the end, his preferred suitor was unable to finance a deal and G.E. was unwilling to spend anything like what it had previously offered. And Kemper stock fell to below where it was before the takeover fight erupted. Fumbled I.P.O. Award To Las Vegas Major League Sports Inc., owner of the Las Vegas team in the Canadian Football League. It went public in April at $8 for a unit of two shares and a warrant to buy another share. The units topped $11 in May, but as the team headed toward last place it stayed in business only with loans from the league. The units now are worth less than $2.

But their awareness of the intense interest in this sprawling computer network was heightened in April when two Arizona lawyers received death threats after they posted an ad for their services -- in the wrong place: on thousands of cyberspace ""bulletin boards"" called news groups. Now, on an ""acceptable"" advertising zone called the World Wide Web, everyone -- Adobe, Compuserve and MCI for starters -- is trying to get in on the act. One company has even invented electronic cash. It's meant to be transferable with clicks on a computer screen. Its inventors also say it will protect spenders' privacy. An Empire That's Likely to Strike It Rich In Hollywood, where breathing is synonymous with hawking a movie deal of one sort or another, one threesome seems poised to succeed with a pop-culture empire like none before. The Disney expatriate Jeffrey Katzenberg, the movie powerhouse Steven Spielberg and the record king David Geffen made plans for a new movie studio last year, in the biggest merger of Hollywood talent since Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith created the United Artists movie empire 75 years ago. The three millionaires one-upped Mr. Chaplin and his cohorts, though, by forming a precedent-setting TV production company with Capital Cities/ABC. The venture will make TV industry history because it will be the first in which a broadcast network shares advertising income and other revenue with an outside producer. Sony Turmoil Could Make a Camera Blink Every time Sony turned around last year, it lost another big name. Jon Peters, who along with Peter Guber once headed Sony's motion picture studio, ended his 4 1/2-year affiliation with Sony. Mr. Guber -- he became a multimillionaire when Sony bought his and Mr. Peters's company, Guber-Peters Entertainment -- left Sony Pictures, the studio that in the last year or so was drained by flops like ""Last Action Hero,"" to follow his ""dreams."" (With ""Philadelphia"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" to his Sony credit, Mr. Guber plans to set up a company that would create films, TV programs and other entertainment.) And Akio Morita, who co-founded Sony and guided it through 22 years of successes that included the oft-imitated Walkman and a key role in the development of the compact disk, resigned because of health problems. Is Fox in a Pickle or Not? Can Rupert Murdoch get himself out of this one? The close of a year in which Mr. Murdoch's Fox network outbid CBS for N.F.L. football and lured away affiliated stations from ABC, CBS and NBC saw Fox get a paw of sorts caught in a Federal Communications Commission trap. Fox has been challenged by NBC and the N.A.A.C.P., both of which say its structure violates an F.C.C. policy limiting foreign ownership of TV stations to 25 percent. Fox is owned by the News Corporation, which is based in Australia. Aha! But control of Fox is held by Mr. Murdoch, its chairman, who became an American citizen before his deal for Fox was completed. Fox noted that the F.C.C. already approved the ownership structure -- in 1986. The F.C.C. has been as tight-lipped as a recluse fur trapper about its investigation. Mr. Murdoch has vowed to challenge NBC's licenses. Disney's Small and Eventful World No one knows this tune better than Walt Disney: It's a world of laughter (all the way to the bank with wildly high proceeds from ""The Lion King""), a world of tears (for its president, Frank Wells, who died in a helicopter crash last year). It's a world of hopes (for buying a television network) and a world of fears (about failing with a historical theme park bordering Civil War battle sites like Bull Run). . . . .

Earlier in the week, 102 Republicans in the House broke ranks with the leadership on the proposed $500 tax credit for families with children. The combined developments suggest trouble for Speaker Newt Gingrich.

The measure cleared the committee by unanimous consent after Democrats agreed to hold their amendments, and their rancor, for the Senate floor.

Both companies said they would have no comment on reports of the merger discussions. But several music industry officials said that Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Disney, and Sir Colin Southgate, the chairman of Thorn EMI, had met and that there had been some preliminary discussions. Music industry executives said such a deal would have a number of pluses and minuses for both sides. On the one hand, the music business has been enormously profitable in recent years -- far more profitable, in fact, than the film business. Disney is a major player in the film, theme park and merchandising businesses, but by not having a large music operation it is missing out on one of the most consistently profitable sectors in the entertainment industry. It is estimated, however, that Disney would have to pay at least $3 billion for what is widely regarded as one of the weakest of the six major music recording companies. In addition, some industry executives said that though Thorn EMI has an excellent library, or catalogue, of recorded music, it has faltered lately and needs strong management. It was not clear, they said, that Disney had the ability to manage a music company. A music company's catalogue can produce enormous revenues. In Thorn EMI's case, it includes such evergreen sellers as the early Beatles recordings, Nat King Cole and contemporary musicians like Garth Brooks and Janet Jackson. Disney is not the only company said to be considering a leap into the music business. Viacom, which acquired Paramount last year for $10 billion, is said to be contemplating an acquisition of a music company to fill out its portfolio of entertainment industry businesses. The question is whether Thorn EMI is ready to sell, and if anyone is willing to pay its price. In Disney's case, the company has enormous financial wherewithal and could easily afford Thorn EMI. But Mr. Eisner is said to be wary of large financial commitments after the company's debacle in Euro Disney, which has caused big losses.",1995/04/29

In fact, zines are so hip now that even the conglomerates are trying to cash in.

Fox also has made several deals in the last two years to insure that it will have access to more children's shows in the future.

2109,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/05/opinion/lamb-to-the-slaughter.html,Lamb To the Slaughter,"On the vast spectrum of American culture, Brian Lamb, the eminence grise of C-Span, is to imperturbability what Madonna is to narcissism. In a TV universe of honking pundits, he has staked his entire network on serving up information deadpan, without ever raising his nonpartisan voice. Nothing gets him ticked off. Or almost nothing. On Jan. 6 there was a rare sighting of an ever-so-slightly testy Mr. Lamb on C-Span. In a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, he pointed out that his network's two-channel, 24-hour menu of public affairs programming had either been cut or eliminated entirely in some nine million homes in the past two or three years. Why? Cable operators will throw off C-Span if they can sell the same precious slot on the dial to a higher bidder. ''Rupert Murdoch has dumped more money into Fox News in the last four or five months than C-Span spent in the last 18 years,'' he said. ''He's buying his way on to cable systems.'' Mr. Lamb added that he was speaking in frustration, not anger, but his words conveyed real heat as he attributed C-Span's travails to the supposedly ''fabulous Telecommunications Act'' Congress passed last year. If Brian Lamb, of all non-firebrands, is smoking, there must be fire. And there is. This week marks the first anniversary of President Clinton's signing of that law he (like leaders of both parties) said would spur marketplace competition to give consumers ''the benefits of lower prices, better quality and greater choices in their telephone and cable systems.'' But conglomerates, not competition, now drive TV: prices are higher, choice is less and ''better quality'' means more Murdoch and less C-Span. What makes C-Span's vulnerability a particularly alarming indicator of the perils of our ruthless new media culture is that it, of all quality programming, has theoretically powerful protectors. C-Span is, after all, the prime unfiltered video showcase for Congress. It is also a network created and financed by the cable industry itself, as a gesture of good citizenship and public relations. (C-Span stands for Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network.) But that gesture may have been a fig leaf. As Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union says, ''Now that stock prices are falling, cable companies will do anything to boost earnings.'' Public service or even public relations may stand little chance against the imperatives of the bottom line. The merger-enhanced Time Warner-Turner and Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) now control what roughly half of America's cable subscribers see. You don't find them or other cable companies ejecting sex or shopping or pay-per-view channels to make room for C-Span 2, let alone for outspoken, independent programming that might be produced by some minority voice not owned by themselves, Disney, Fox, Viacom or G.E. In his speech, Mr. Lamb understandably did not attack the industry that feeds him. It's up to the public and Congress to do so, but will they? ''Politicians are terrorized by media moguls and won't take them on except about minor things like the V-chip,'' says Jeff Chester of the Center for Media Education. Much of the public, though beginning to complain about higher cable rates and to protest C-Span cutbacks (successfully so this month in Seattle), is still in the dark about the vast and troubling implications of the new media conglomerates. As Neil Hickey writes in the Columbia Journalism Review, the 1996 Telecommunications Act was hardly covered by network news and ''appeared in the business pages of newspapers (if it appeared at all).'' That's not all that isn't covered. Mr. Hickey wonders how strenuously any TV news organization will investigate human rights abuses in China, given the huge financial interests of their parent corporations in that growing market; NBC even apologized for Bob Costas's criticism of China during the Olympics. Now Brian Lamb tells us that even the most basic of American news -- Congressional deliberations -- is being silenced in our new TV universe of supposedly infinite choices. We're inured by now to our media giants being greedy, but when a democracy's flow of information is being restricted, something far more important than our monthly cable bill is at stake.",1997/02/05

This bootlegging has gone largely unchallenged because the pricey knockoffs (up to $225 for light-and-sound-equipped phasers, $125 for communicators) attract a relatively small number of die-hards. Gene Roddenberry's attitude was that so long as a legitimate licensee wasn't being hurt, he had no problem, says Richard Arnold, an associate of the series' late creator. Yes, well, Roddenberry was famous for his squishy humanism. Now, however, fans are buzzing that Viacom, which owns rights to the show, is threatening unlicensed vendors with charges of trademark and copyright infringement, forcing them to shut down. The result? Skyrocketing replica prices. Collectors are scrambling, says Tom Vaccina, a former trader from Brooklyn. A guy from Sweden called me and said, 'I'll give you $800 for Dr. McCoy's medical kit.' A guy from Australia offered me $1,000 for a 'working' tricorder. With a new Viacom retail store opening in Chicago in May, some bitter Trekkies -- who prefer handcrafted, limited-run replicas to what they assume will be mass-market junk -- are calling the crackdown a belated attempt to exploit a previously neglected source of revenue.

It is his politically risky plan to end housing and utility subsidies. 1 What NATO Really Means President Clinton has sung the praises of the NATO alliance all week, speaking boldly of a new European order. But his remarks add up to less than a comprehensive plan for the future. He seemed to be addressing European security concerns more than making a case to his own electorate. News analysis. 8 Rights Abuses Stir Turkey Turkey's leaders insist that the country's rights violations have been exaggerated, but the issue has provided the European Union with a powerful reason to continue holding Turkey at arm's length. 3 Inevitable End in Cambodia The battle in Cambodia last week might in the long term be considered a ''mopping-up operation'' -- the final eruption of long-simmering tensions between rivals struggling for dominance. News analysis. 10 Clinton on Bosnia Role President Clinton, leaving Denmark after a weeklong trip to Europe, kept the door open to a United States military role in Bosnia next year after the current deployment of American and other NATO troops ends. 8 Basque Politician Wounded A kidnapped Basque politician, Miguel Angel Blanco, was found comatose on a roadside with two bullets in his head, less than an hour after a separatist deadline for his threatened slaying had passed. 10 NATIONAL 12-17 Rules Aimed at Criminals Slow Citizenship Process The Immigration and Naturalization Service is struggling to put new procedures in place to prevent immigrants with criminal records from becoming citizens. But the changes are making people wait more than a year to become citizens. 1 Trend Toward Debit Cards Millions of Americans are getting debit cards, also known as check cards, even though they did not ask for them. While the cards offer convenience, they can also cost customers money. 1 Oil Drilling at Stake Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is saying little about whether he will decide to allow oil drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Oil companies say they can drill without damaging the environment, but Eskimos are worried. 12 Rover Gets the Message The Mars Pathfinder rover finally got the electronic instructions that prompted it to ease out of an awkward parking spot on part of a rock. 12 Clinton Turns to Tax Cuts President Clinton assailed the tax cut proposals of the Republicans, saying they would not help the middle class enough and would make the deficit rise. But he did not threaten a veto. 14 Maneuvers on Senate Hearings The first week of Senate campaign-financing hearings showed that Democrats were ready to counter the charges. Republicans considered a change in their approach, which has been to try to present a bipartisan face at the proceedings. 14 NEW YORK/REGION 19-24 A Year After Flight 800, Pennsylvania Town's Agony The passing of a year has had some soothing effect on Montoursville, Pa., the small town that lost 21 people, most of them high-school students, in the mysterious crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800. off the coast of Long Island.

2099,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/25/classified/paid-notice-deaths-sonderling-egmont.html,"Paid Notice: Deaths SONDERLING, EGMONT","SONDERLING-Egmont. We have lost a loving husband, a father and a grandfather-our beloved Egmont Sonderling. To those of us who loved him, his kindness and concern for others will forever be in our hearts. Egmont's life is the story of faith, hard work, dedication and commitment. We will all cherish the memories of how he expressed his feelings to each of us in his quiet, unassuming way. Egmont's journey to America, almost 75 years ago, began on an oil tanker which crossed the Atlantic Ocean. He came to Chester, Pennsylvania. As millions of European immigrants had done, Egmont came to the United States because he heard and believed that here the streets were paved with gold. He very much wanted to participate in the American Dream. He would often remark that when he first saw New York City he was simply overwhelmed. Over the years, his faith centered him in the belief that G-d must have been on his side. Egmont never forgot that just ten years after his arrival in America, the horror of Nazi Germany would be unleashed against his beloved people and all of mankind. Egmont Sonderling's destiny took him to Chicago where he became a visionary in the emerging fields of broadcasting, entertainment and advertising. In the ensuing 65 years, he built a company that would become one of the world's pioneer group broadcasting corporations, covering 11 major markets. His success touched a large chain of movie theaters in New England and New York. In 1980, the majority of his then publicly owned Sonderling Broadcast Corporation was merged in to Viacom International. Throughout these years of active, creative leadership, this wonderful man always remembered his humble origins, always remembered his family, was always concerned for the quality of life for all people. Egmont was truly forever grateful for the opportunities he found in America. His enthusiasm for life was unbounded. His life's experience instilled within him a deep, principled commitment to give something back to the people in the communities where he lived. He decided early on that his success was to be shared with others and he derived a tremendous sense of joy in being able to support many causes across the nation and around the world. Egmont Sonderling had a special feeling for the residents, tenants and clients of the Miami Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged at Douglas Gardens. He was always conscious of his heritage and grateful that he had been given the opportunity to escape the years of horror in Germany. In this way, as both a philanthropist and as a Board Member, he was deeply involved with an organization which aids Jewish elderly and which provides care to thousands of Floridians of all races, religions and creeds. Our beloved Egmont earned a reputation as a most generous host in his support of a long list of other worthy causes as well: medical research, the handicapped, and the arts, especially the Opera and Ballet. He became a Crown Jewel during the Golden Anniversary Season of the Opera and also served as Co-Chair of the Grand Opera Ball. Those of us who mourn this loving, decent and honorable man will cherish the bright dreams he dreamed and the love which we will share always. Survived by his devoted wife Marjorie Serralles Sonderling, loving children Roy and Bonnie Sonderling, Annik Serralles Wolf and Michael, Juan E. Serralles, IV and Rita, Marjorie E. Serralles Russell and Terrence, Mary Ann F. Serralles Alonso and Mark, cherished grandchildren Morgan Wolf and Juan E. Serralles, V. SONDERLING - Egmont. The Board of Directors, FOUNDERS, Auxilians, Volunteers, Corporate Administration and all the Staff Members of the Miami Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged at Douglas Gardens, join with the Home's residents, Irving Cypen Tower tenants, and participants of the organization's communitywide services in extending our heartfelt condolences to the family of Egmont Sonderling on the passing of this remarkable man, this steadfast friend, this extraordinary leader and pillar of our community. Egmont Sonderling was an inspirational man of vision, a guiding force behind the ongoing success of the Miami Jewish Home. As a member of our Board of Directors, he gave of his brilliance and business acumen to make the visions of the Home come to fruition. He served wisely as a member of our Board's Finance and Appropriations Committee, the Health and Human Services Committee, and was an Honorary Vice President of our Home. Egmont Sonderling was a Million Dollar FOUNDER of our Home, and upon presenting a multi-million dollar gift, with tears of joy welling in his eyes, he expressed his love for the elderly residents of our Home and how it brought him much joy to see their smiling faces and the dignity of life they were provided through the philanthropy of our community. He thanked G-d for having given him success in life and said he was so happy to be able to share his success with others, stating, ''I wanted this contribution to be made to an organization which is considered to be an example by which similar organizations throughout the western world judge their effectiveness.'' Throughout his wonderful life, this kind and special man never forgot his heritage, his struggles or his dreams. His lifetime of achievement was marked by his philanthropic generosity to many organizations and causes throughout the world. Mr. Sonderling's life stands as a monument to the American experience-that belief that dreams could come true. Egmont Sonderling's legacy will live forever at our Home as we watch the construction now occurring and prepare to open, in late 1998, the magnificent One Egmont Sonderling Place. This majestic tropical gateway, where thousands of elderly persons and their family members, volunteers, scholars, academicians, researchers, elected officials, legislators, clergy, workers, donors, students, youth, and people from all walks of life will pass through as they enter the Southeast's largest, most progressive and most comprehensive center for care of the elderly, will be a fitting memorial to one who so unselfishly gave of himself to make their lives a more beautiful daily experience. In tribute to their magnanimous gesture, Egmont and his beloved wife, Marjorie, were honored last December at the Home's 50th Anniversary Celebration, where an audience of 1,200 leaders of our community applauded his sterling career and his devotion to charitable causes. Our Chairman of the Board and Honorary President, Irving Cypen, expresses on this occasion that ''In each generation, there are only a handful of people who allow the guiding hand of the Almighty to work His loving kindness through them, and who give themselves as His servants, to guide our people and our world. We have lost such a man with the passing of Egmont Sonderling. We will sorely miss this true lover of righteousness standing firmly in our midst.'' It is difficult in our deep mourning to find words that express our feelings now, and we sincerely extend sympathy to Egmont's family: devoted wife Marjorie Serralles Sonderling, loving children and grandchildren, Roy and Bonnie Sonderling, Annik Serralles Wolf and Michael, Juan E. Serralles IV and Rita, Marjorie E. Serralles Russell and Terrence, Mary Ann F. Serralles Alonso and Mark, cherished grandchildren Morgan Wolf and Juan E. Serralles V.

The International Monetary Fund thought it had a deal in October to bail out the country and put it on a more austere path. Then came a 1998 budget that imposed austerity on everyone but the Government and the well connected. High-level visitors flocked to Jakarta to explain to the Suharto Government that this just wouldn't do. On Monday, Version 1.1 of the deal had Indonesia pledging to behave and getting a few concessions on budget surpluses and bank closings. (The latter, the I.M.F. acknowledged, had clearly backfired.) But once again the deal was threatened by rear-guard actions to spare the vast business empires of President Suharto's family and friends from the bitter economic pill. Progressively bigger wigs -- including President Clinton and Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director -- weighed in.

Late last week, the studio fired three ranking movie executives -- the president of production and its two marketing chiefs -- after several flops. The men who run the studio and made the ill-fated film choices, Ron Meyer and Casey Silver, were left unscathed. But Edgar Bronfman, the 42-year-old scion of the Bronfman family fortune, sternly countered that the executive turnover was warranted and ''has nothing to do with the performance of the movies,'' adding that quality of teamwork was the issue.",1998/04/20

Both give us a politician whose liberal ideals have been compromised by worldly temptations -- whether campaign contributors bearing big bucks or campaign groupies bearing big hair. But with all due respect to Mr. Nichols and Mr. Beatty, the Hollywood movie that may most capture our moment is at once less tied to transient Washington headlines and more subversive -- a big-picture vision likely to catch the public by surprise much as ''The Graduate'' and ''Bonnie and Clyde'' once did.

The deficit in February was $12.2 billion. The new figures provided clear evidence of the impact on the United States -- both good and bad -- of Asia's mounting economic woes. Growth in the American economy, which had been threatening to overheat, was restrained. But at the same time, United States exports remained weak, hurting many manufacturers and farmers, and imports surged, a trend that does not bode well for the long term. INTEREST RATES No Increase, for Now The Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Market Committee declined once again to increase short-term interest rates, apparently viewing the threat of inflation as remote and believing that any American rate increase could worsen the economic situation in Asia. Underlying the benign view of inflation are a number of recent indicators, including a 2.3 percent decline in new housing starts last month, to an annual rate of 1.538 million units. Many analysts had expected a small gain. Minutes of the Fed's March 31 meeting show that it saw a risk of inflation but decided to hold rates steady because of Asia's malaise. MARKETS Commodity Index Skids The Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities skidded to its lowest level in more than four years, dropping to 219.27 on Tuesday and ending the week at 219.18. Futures prices for copper, silver, oil, nickel, wheat and other commodities have been in a long-term decline that has been aggravated in recent days by Indonesia's political turmoil and -- see a pattern here? -- the Asian economic collapse. Stock and bond markets were little changed for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 9,144.44, up 48.44. But technology stocks were battered, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 41.77, to close at 1,805, its weakest level in more than six weeks. TOBACCO A Pipe Dream? Anti-smoking legislation hit a potentially serious snag in the Senate, and further action was postponed until next month, sending President Clinton; Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other Senate leaders who want to deter teen-agers' smoking back to the drafting table. Just as it appeared a consensus was forming to increase the Federal tax on cigarettes by $1.10 a pack while giving tobacco companies some protection against lawsuits, an unusual coalition of senators formed. Some want to kill the legislation, while others advocate the toughest possible anti-smoking measure. ''We are making a deal with the Devil,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who opposes any limit on the companies' legal liability. SOCIAL SECURITY A Market-Based Proposal The National Commission on Retirement Policy, which includes members of Congress from both parties, proposed a sweeping overhaul of the Social Security system, calling for the establishment of personal investment accounts and a gradual increase in the retirement age, to 70, to make up for a cash shortfall expected when 77 million baby boomers become eligible for Social Security benefits. ''The goal of this is to have people more involved in their own savings,'' said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, a leader of the group, which includes lawmakers, economists, pension-system experts and business executives. The report says the changes would keep Social Security solvent for at least 75 years without raising taxes. Some liberals, however, oppose any plan that does not offer guaranteed benefits.

The contract was an invitation to continue to edit the magazine whose words had set it apart as an intellectual arbiter and whose balance sheet -- over which she had little control -- had set it apart as a financial sinkhole. Brill's Content was proof that alternatives existed, that a high-profile editor with well-endowed backers could create a magazine with instant impact.",1998/07/13

NBC was eager to garner the prestige from broadcasting a classic. But the network was also, by its own admission, deeply reluctant to display the author's name too prominently, for fear it would make the program appear taxing, a dose of the cod-liver oil of education rather than the cotton candy of pure entertainment its target audience of younger viewers so desires. Halmi has sharp commercial instincts -- Hallmark Entertainment, the company over which he presides as chairman, will churn out about 40 made-for-television movies and mini-series this year. And NBC's resistance dramatized for him how emphatically the strapped financial condition of most of the networks is shaping their creative direction.

After making a costly $53 billion stock bid for Mediaone Group, the nation's fourth-largest cable operator, a month earlier, Comcast found itself trumped by AT&T, which had muscled in with a $58 billion stock and cash offer. Comcast had sought help from Microsoft the previous week, hoping the software giant would dig into its $22 billion cash coffer to aid the company in its bid. But even as Microsoft's chief financial officer, Gregory Maffei, met that week with Comcast at the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell, Microsoft's law firm, the Comcast team knew that Microsoft representatives were simultaneously meeting with its rival, AT&T, indicating that Microsoft might only be using the talks with Comcast as leverage in the AT&T negotiations.",1999/05/06

A man of vision and compassion, with a singular devotion to causes that truly matter, Martin Davis melded extraordinary skills in business with philanthropy to enrich the lives of countless individuals. His vision and his unyielding devotion to imrpoving childrens' health care helped to inspire The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, and he served as co-chair of its Steering Committee. His leadership of that initiative and his magnificent generosity will leave an enduring legacy to children and their families for generations to come. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his beloved wife, Luella, and his son Philip. He will be missed by all whose lives he touched. Spencer Foreman, MD, President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center Irwin Redlener, MD, Pres The Children's Hospital at Montefiore DAVIS-Martin S.

He is mourned and survived by his beloved wife, Luella Davis, son Philip Davis, brother-inlaw Robert Dryden and niece Emma Dryden as well as by countless friends and associates. He was a giant among business leaders, serving as chairman and chief executive officer of Gulf + Western Industries and its successor company, Paramount Communications, from 1983 until its merger into Viacom, Inc. in 1994. During his tenure, he lead one of corporate history's most sweeping and successful restructurings of the Gulf + Western conglomerate into a focused and financially strong entertainment publishing powerhouse. More recently, Mr. Davis was a managing partner of Wellspring Capital Management LLC, a private equity firm he helped form in 1995. Despite his considerable corporate duties, he had for many years devoted time, energy, and funds to a broad range of civic and charitable activities. Since 1972, he had been a leader in the fight against multiple sclerosis and served the MS Society on both the local and national levels. He also was vice chairman of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation and a member of the Board of Trustees of Carnegie Hall. Mr. Davis also served on the Board of Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center, where he helped spearhead the building of a new Children's Hospital at that facility. Funeral services will be private.

Davis. He led the fight against MS locally and nationally for more than 27 years with unparalleled continuity and dedication. His personal commitment to excellence, his exceptional persistence, and fierce determination to eradicate this cruel disease were an inspiration to everyone involved in the fight against MS and to all those he pursuaded to enlist in our work. He personally raised more money to advance MS research and to provide services and assistance to those affected by the disease than any other individual in the organization's history. His was a profoundly personal form of leadership that is rarely experienced and never replaced. We extend heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife, Luella, and his son Philip.

On stage, the Nitro Girls dance troupe mimicked sexual intercourse on stage to rap music by House of Pain. Three-hundred-pound men with stage names like Sid Vicious, Lex Luger and Sting shouted threats at one another. (''How about a game of hide and seek? You hide. I seek. Then I destroy!'')

Attention should be paid to this cautionary tale, and not for the reasons you might expect. As those whose memories haven't entirely purged Monicagate will recall, Mr. Drudge is the fedora-wearing grandstander whom many, I included, once feared as the Devil of journalism incarnate. He published malicious rumors as fact and, with the new-fangled speed of the Internet at his back, browbeat some insecure Old Media news organizations into repeating them. He hijacked scoops from other reporters. He boasted about his lack of education and his contempt for professional standards. So what if he got some stories wrong, prompting a major defamation suit? He got some big ones -- including The Dress -- right. Likening himself to John Peter Zenger while addressing the cowed mainstream media at the National Press Club, he spoke of how the Internet was ''going to save the news business'' because ''every citizen can be a reporter, can take on the powers that be.''",1999/12/04

Then, in 1996, after the television industry was publicly embarrassed when some chuckleheaded station executives tried to pass off shows like ''The Jetsons'' as educational -- it ''teaches children what life will be like in the 21st century,'' executives told federal regulators -- the Federal Communications Commission spelled out what stations had to do: three hours a week of ''core educational programming.'' The three-hour rule, as it is popularly known, took effect in the fall of 1997. Since then, children's television activists say, programming for children has gotten better. ''There's been a significant improvement in overall quality,'' Kathryn Montgomery, the president of the Center for Media Education, said. ''I think it's worked out fairly well.''",2000/02/27

Like Forrest, the American people were good, if a bit simple, and would overcome all adversity just by floating along. Other opinion mongers composed a gloomier allegory: Forrest represented an America that was blind to the consequences of its actions, heedless to the burden of its history. In either interpretation, ''Forrest Gump'' sounded like the key film of the Reagan presidency, which was strange, since it was voted the best picture award in the early months of 1995.

The move was especially important for Mrs. Clinton, since her political standing had eroded seriously in her first weeks in office. It was not just Republicans accusing her of mimicking her husband's grasping approach to money and political favors. Democrats who voted for her to continue the state's progressive senatorial tradition were speaking openly of their sense of betrayal. The Clintons said they would repay $85,966 to cover the furniture, china and silver bought by wealthy donors to furnish their new houses. The Clintons reported over $190,000 in gifts for 2000, but Mrs. Clinton's spokesman said that figure included gifts from earlier years that were not formally accepted until last year. The $85,966 is supposed to be the value of the housing items that came in a distasteful glut near the end of Mr. Clinton's last year in office. Senate rules would have prevented Mrs. Clinton from taking the gifts after she was sworn in to her new office.

Both authors should have declined to accept large up-front payments while still in office, as such payments can too easily be seen as bids for favorable treatment. Instead, they should have limited themselves to royalties on books actually sold, a better indication that they are being paid what their books have earned. The best course of all for Mr. Giuliani, since he has only 11 months left in his term, would have been to wait until he was out of office to sign a contract.

Also, Badda Bing is the name of a strip club on the television series.

So when the opportunity came along last year to take the top job at perhaps the most specialized network in cable television, the Weather Channel, Mr. Burke seemed to be the man for the niche. The Weather Channel reaches 86 million homes, with an average of 21.1 million tuning in each day. And industry research indicates that in at least several million households, the channel has an almost cultish audience of weather watchers who follow hurricanes, tornados and blizzards with the avidity of sports fans. So devoted is its core audience that, to keep from being overrun by tourists, the Weather Channel has avoided putting its logo on the network's headquarters outside Atlanta.",2003/11/03

His name was ''Joe Millionaire,'' and, with audiences peaking at 40 million viewers, he (with a lot of help from a show called ''American Idol'') carried Fox off to great things in the second half of the season. Fox came within a whisker of overtaking NBC for its first outright win in the competition for the 18-to-49-year-old viewers that every network but CBS, which is owned by Viacom Inc., considers the benchmark for prime-time success.",2004/01/05

Like ''erectile dysfunction,'' a term used in halftime advertisements for Cialis, it was a somewhat startling euphemism. If Monday morning quarterbacks are any guide, few people thought it was by accident that Mr. Timberlake's hand snaked across Ms. Jackson's torso as he reached the lyric, ''I'll have you naked by the end of this song,'' and tore off one bustier cup, releasing a breast partly obscured by a sunburst-shaped nipple broach. The gesture seemed timed to more than the music: the very next commercial was a close-up of Ms. Jackson's cleavage in a gaudy promotion for next week's Grammy Awards on CBS.

Consider, to begin with, the strange tangle of interested parties mixed up in the post-debacle legal scrum. CBS broadcast the game, MTV produced the halftime entertainment, Viacom owns both CBS and MTV, the F.C.C. is investigating the incident, and the N.F.L. is miffed at MTV.

And then, of course, there is the rest of the world. The Federal Communications Commission plans to try to decide whether the breast baring was intentional and, if so, what fines to levy. The real problem -- something for viewers to ponder, not the F.C.C. -- is the pyramid of contradictions embodied in the Super Bowl extravaganza. There seemed about as much relation between the hyperbolic sexuality of the dancing and the offending part of Ms. Jackson's anatomy as there is between the hypertrophied athleticism of the football players on the field and the erectile dysfunction ads that peppered the broadcast. Tempting as it is to single out a corporate or individual villain here, the incident is a cultural short-circuit. During the game, an enactment of rage. During halftime, an enactment of lust.

Two weeks after the bustier bust, almost no one has come to the defense of Janet Jackson. I do so with a full heart. By baring a single breast in a slam-dunk publicity stunt of two seconds' duration, this singer also exposed just how many boobs we have in this country. We owe her thanks for a genuine public service. You can argue that Ms. Jackson is the only honest figure in this Super Bowl of hypocrisy. She was out to accomplish a naked agenda -- the resuscitation of her fading career on the eve of her new album's release -- and so she did. She's not faking much remorse, either. Last Sunday she refused to appear on the Grammys rather than accede to CBS's demand that she perform a disingenuous, misty-eyed ritual ''apology'' to the nation for her crime of a week earlier. By contrast, Justin Timberlake, the wimp who gave the English language the lasting gift of ''wardrobe malfunction,'' did as he was told, a would-be pop rebel in a jacket and a tie, looking like a schoolboy reporting to the principal's office.

They're nostalgia magnets, these pictures. We look at them and think, That was life. The hats, the crowds, the shows, the bars -- yes, here was life in the center of the city that was the center of the world. And as Times Square is in so many ways the incarnation of urban life itself, so nostalgia for Times Square is nostalgia for a lost idea of urbanness, or of urbanity -- for a time, before the advent of television and the suburbs, and before riots and drug wars, when everyone knew that city life was the best life of all. Of course, cities themselves aren't dying -- quite the contrary. Urban downtowns are being brought back to life by baseball stadiums and refurbished harbors and train-stations-become-gallerias. And surely there is no single place that demonstrates the renaissance of the old downtowns more impressively than Times Square itself, which passed through pornography and pathology to emerge, once again, as the capital of popular culture, with the nation's busiest McDonald's and the world's biggest Toys ''R'' Us and the corporate headquarters of Viacom and Reuters and Condé Nast.

This entity, encompassing all forms of mass culture, media and the businesses behind them, made up such a totalizing system that it was literally impossible to rebel against it. This complex not only anticipated the urge to revolt but would sell you something to satisfy it. (Che Guevara T-shirt, anyone?) It's a resoundingly depressing theory but an interesting one to recall, because anticorporate sentiment is lately prominent in pop culture. The most intriguing example is a documentary called ''The Corporation,'' which opens in about 30 cities across the United States this summer. The film offers a fairly relentless (though at times clever and quite entertaining) two-and-a-half-hour assault on business power; it gives screen time to Noam Chomsky and the radical historian Howard Zinn, and it depicts the corporation not just as a callous and brutish institution but also as a ''psychopath.'' Produced in Canada, it has been playing in that country since January and has so far grossed about $1.1million, a record for a Canadian documentary; a companion book with the same name made it onto Canadian best-seller lists. It has been an audience hit at festivals from Toronto to Sundance, and the filmmakers say that thousands of people have signed up on the Web site to send e-mail and hand out fliers to promote the film. ''The Corporation'' has also picked up distribution in Great Britain, France, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea and Australia.

According to Mr. Pappas, media conglomerates like the News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and The New York Times Company now control the American public's notion of truth and are using the very tactics that George Orwell described in ''1984'' to reshape that truth to conform to their corporate interests. Life, alas, is not so simple, as the simple existence of Mr. Pappas's ingratiatingly ragged, homemade movie suggests. A. J. Liebling's famous dictum, ''Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one,'' has never been truer, but then, never have more people owned presses -- or at least, the personal computers and camcorders that have become their 21st-century equivalents.

That's what both parties deserve for having steadily sanded down their quadrennial celebrations into infomercials with all the spark and spontaneity of the televised Yule Log. But though few want to say so aloud, there is one potential last-minute ingredient that would instantly bring back gavel-to-gavel coverage on the Big Three: a terrorist attack. That fearful possibility is both conventions' sole claim to suspense. It is also the subtext of this entire presidential campaign. A late-June USA Today/CNN poll shows that 55 percent of Americans feel less safe because of the war in Iraq -- a figure that has spiked 22 points in merely six months. Fear rules. Fear rocks. Fear of terrorism is George W. Bush's only second-term platform to date (unless you count fear of same-sex marriage). Let John F. Kerry roll out John Edwards as his running mate, and Tom Ridge rushes to grab back the TV spotlight by predicting that Al Qaeda will ''disrupt our democratic process.'' Never mind that he had no ''precise knowledge'' of such an attack or any plans to raise his color-coded threat level; his real mission, to wield fear as a weapon of mass distraction, had been accomplished.

There were thrilling movies at Cannes -- movies that told original, compelling stories about life in Senegal and upper-middle-class Paris and the jungles of Thailand. But those movies (and many others) contrasted sharply with the American films spotlighted at the festival, whose chief purpose, it seemed, was to please the widest possible audience. Along with weapons, movies are among our most lucrative exports to a waiting world, and in the last seven years or so, it has become clear that the expected audience for nearly all American-made studio movies, the audience they are designed and created for, has shifted from the 50 states to the global marketplace. This change in perspective has, naturally, resulted in a change in content: nuances of language or the subtleties of comedy do not translate easily between cultures, but action or fantasy or animation is immediately comprehensible, even if you live in, say, Japan, which is the country that most big studios long to reach. Films like this year's ''Troy'' (which was shown at Cannes), ''The Day After Tomorrow'' and ''Van Helsing,'' which are not dependent on dialogue, did not play as well as expected in America but became huge hits in many other countries, making several times what they made in the U.S. box office. Thankfully, the so-called specialty divisions of the big studios still try to depict the prevailing mood of the country. But consider a specialty film like ''Sideways,'' which is the best American movie I have seen this year: it has no international stars and no action, and because the film shifts in tone from comedy to drama in nearly every scene, it is not likely to be easily comprehended by a worldwide audience. As far as the big studios go, ''Sideways'' is essentially a foreign film made in America.",2004/11/14

The film, which opens in New York on Dec. 24, stars Kevin Bacon as a pedophile who has just been released from jail. While all kinds of mental illness and acts of extreme violence can be intriguing to audiences, the story of a deeply flawed but sympathetic man who is attracted to very young girls does not lend itself to the sort of film, however worthy, that any studio would be likely to finance or distribute, especially at Christmas. Which is exactly why Bob Berney, the president of Newmarket Films, is releasing it then. In the last three years, first at IFC Films and, for the last 28 months, at Newmarket, Berney has proved to be remarkably perceptive about the tastes of the moviegoing public. Against all odds, he masterminded the distribution of ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding,'' which had no stars and was considered too mainstream by most independents, and ''The Passion of the Christ,'' which was rejected by many studios. Those films have earned, respectively, $241.4million and $370.3 million in the United States, making them by a large margin the two most successful independent films of all time. In 2003, Newmarket released ''Monster,'' starring Charlize Theron, who gained 30 pounds and wore heavy makeup to play the murderer Aileen Wuornos. ''We opened our serial-killer, lesbian-prostitute film on Christmas Eve in Manhattan,'' Berney said, linking ''Monster'' to ''The Woodsman.'' ''And it worked.'' Theron won practically every award invented, including an Oscar, and the movie, which cost roughly $8 million, went on to make $34.5 million. Newmarket Films and its ''genius'' (as Theron called Berney) were suddenly the biggest success story in the movie business.",2004/12/19

It's a way of keeping it all in the family: if the show succeeds, the profits from its initial run and its later syndication go to the same corporate parent. This year, the trend is stronger than ever; Paramount Network Television, for example, is producing shows only for CBS and UPN, which like Paramount are owned by Viacom. Is a show's corporate bloodline the best predictor of whether it makes it onto a network's schedule? Looking at the 10-year trend, Steve Sternberg, an analyst at Magna Global USA, said yes. And synergistic favors don't end there. ''An in-house program has a better chance of getting a good time period, and of being given more time if it's not working right away,'' he said. On the eve of upfront week, when networks announce which series they're picking up, here's a look at how many of the shows they were considering were produced by sister studios. ABC: 15 of 27 pilots were produced or co-produced by another Disney unit, Touchstone Television. ABC's three big new hits, ''Lost,'' ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Grey's Anatomy,'' are Touchstone shows; repeating that success rate will be hard. But three of the pilots, ''Pros & Cons,'' ''What About Brian'' and ''The Catch,'' are from J.J. Abrams, who also produces ''Lost.'' CBS: 12 of 19 pilots produced or co-produced by Paramount Network Television, from ''Quantico'' (about F.B.I. profilers, starring Mandy Patinkin) to an untitled sitcom centered on Susie Essman, the foul-mouthed comedian from ''Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' FOX: 16 of 23 pilots produced or co-produced by 20th Century Fox Television or its Regency Television unit. ''Prison Break,'' from 20th Century Fox, has already been picked up. NBC: 15 of 23 pilots produced or co-produced by NBC Universal. The post-''Friends'' NBC wants a hit sitcom: 11 of the 15 are half-hour comedies. UPN: 6 of 10 pilots produced or co-produced by Paramount Network Television or Spelling Television, both owned by Viacom. WB: 9 of 18 pilots produced or co-produced by Warner Brothers Television.

Instead, we seek to align ourselves with the character or story in other ways. This, at least, is a core idea of the licensing business, which brings together the owners of properties like Spider-Man, Shrek and Napoleon Dynamite (the licensers) and the makers of things like coffee mugs, T-shirts and tire covers (the licensees) to convert ordinary commodities into consumable signifiers. Licensing is already such an enormously pervasive practice that you might wonder what new constituency it could possibly reach. An answer to that question appeared not long ago on the cover of the trade magazine Brandweek, in the form of a photograph of a dog wearing a SpongeBob SquarePants sweater. It's not just the owners of entertainment properties like SpongeBob who are interested in extending their fan bases to domesticated animals; luxury and ''lifestyle'' brands like Louis Vuitton and Harley-Davidson are moving into the market as well. This development seems curious insofar as pets, really, are brand-neutral: your pug is indifferent to the status message sent by Burberry, your chow chow is not a Jeep fan and your labradoodle doesn't have a favorite indie movie. Even so, it turns out that the SpongeBob dog sweater was an instant hit when it first appeared last year, selling out its initial run faster than anything else in the holiday catalog for Nickelodeon, the network that owns SpongeBob.

So he began working the phones.

''Americans do not like dark,'' Moonves told me last May, before a scheduling meeting to select CBS's fall 2005 lineup. Moonves, who was wearing a gray suit, white shirt and diagonally striped maroon and navy tie, was in a wood-paneled corner office on the 35th floor of Black Rock, the longtime home of CBS on 52nd Street in Manhattan. The office used to belong to William S. Paley, the legendary tycoon who personified CBS for more than 60 years. Truman Capote once remarked that Paley ''looks like a man who has just swallowed an entire human being,'' and Moonves has that same sort of aggressive vigor -- an almost palpable appetite and enthusiasm for the complications and constant challenges of network TV. On this particular Thursday, at 11 a.m., Moonves was considering which of the network's current shows to cancel in order to make room for new programs. He had decided to take a once-promising show called ''Joan of Arcadia'' off the air. The show was about a teenager who receives directives and advice straight from God. ''In the beginning, it was a fresh idea and uplifting, and the plot lines were engaging,'' Moonves said, sounding a little sad and frustrated. ''But the show got too dark. I understand why creative people like dark, but American audiences don't like dark. They like story. They do not respond to nervous breakdowns and unhappy episodes that lead nowhere. They like their characters to be a part of the action. They like strength, not weakness, a chance to work out any dilemma. This is a country built on optimism.''",2005/09/04

And, the early prospectuses argued, there was a huge, natural market of people who spend hours in their vehicles, often bored out of their skulls. Skeptics -- let me raise a hand -- observed that in most cities, there were many more channels of radio available free over the air than there were TV stations when cable came on the scene.
