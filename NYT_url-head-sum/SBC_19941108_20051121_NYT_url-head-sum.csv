Here are a few around the country that promise to be packed in the coming weeks, as faithful fans celebrate or mourn together: New York YANKEE TAVERN -- 72 East 161st Street, Bronx, 718-292-6130. Opened in 1928 just outside Ruth's house (after he became a Yankee, of course), this has long been the bar of choice for Yankees fans -- and players. Old photographs and murals of Yankees greats adorn the wall, giving the place the feel of a baseball museum. With nine TV's and 12 draft beers, this is a sports bar in the truest sense, oozing history, especially during the Yankees' annual playoff run. St. Louis OZZIE'S RESTAURANT AND SPORTS BAR -- 645 Westport Plaza, Maryland Heights, Mo., 314-434-1000. The Cardinals have already wrapped up the National League Central title at Busch Stadium and are looking to make an impact in the playoffs. Opened by Cardinals' Hall of Fame shortstop Ozzie Smith in 1988, the bar features a large menu and 55 televisions, including five big screens. San Francisco BAYSIDE SPORTS BAR AND GRILL -- 1787 Union Street, 415-673-1565. With the Giants battling to make it to the playoffs and Barry Bonds making history with his bat, tickets to SBC Park have been hard to come by. Bayside, with its 40-plus TV's, 18 draft beers and full menu, is as close to the action as the unticketed can get -- without a kayak, that is. Chicago MURPHY'S BLEACHERS -- 3655 North Sheffield Avenue, 773-281-5356. Just across the street from Wrigley Field, Murphy's, which opened in the 1930's, serves as a crowded extension of Wrigley. With rooftop seating available for private parties, a beer garden, dozens of TV's and 15 beers on tap, Murphy's is the place to watch as the Cubs look to win the National League wild card. Houston GRIFF'S -- 3416 Roseland Street, 713-528-9912. As the Astros make a bid for the National League wild card at Minute Maid Park, the crowd at Houston's self-proclaimed oldest sports bar swells. Griff's opened in 1965, the same year as the Astrodome, and while the Astrodome now sits vacant, the bar is still buzzing with some 17 TV's, including 3 big screens.

The merger would likely reduce the number of phone companies that will compete for local phone customers, thus lessening the incentive to offer lower prices or better service. But the two companies might be able to show that the merger will create large savings that can be passed along to customers. The Justice Department and Federal regulators owe consumers a probing investigation before they grant approval. The merged company would be the second-largest telecommunications firm, exceeded only by AT&T, with about $25 billion in revenues, 35 million customers and 130,000 employees spread out over 12 Eastern states. Bell Atlantic and Nynex do not serve the same households, so there will be no immediate effect on competition for the business of local phone customers. The merger might nevertheless help customers if it produces substantial cost savings.

On Friday, Intel broke the news that it wouldn't rake in quite the fortune it had expected to, and investors, fearing a high-tech judgment day, sent its shares down 15 percent within minutes. And since Intel is the world's largest maker of computer chips and since computers are where it's at these days, the whole market gave a little shudder -- especially the technology-heavy Nasdaq. By day's end, though, investors decided the digital world as we know it was not crashing, and Intel's shares were off just 7 percent, to $151.50. The Dow industrials barely changed, at 7,331, while the Nasdaq lost 2.7 percent. Nike, another company that seemed invincible -- or at least seemed to have endless cash to pay athletes to display its little swoosh -- also took a hit. Its shares fell 13 percent on Thursday after it predicted less-bouncy earnings, but recovered a bit Friday, closing the week at $57.25. REGULATORS A New F.C.C. Ball Game ''I hope we put the ball in the net more times than not,'' Reed E. Hundt said last week -- and no, he wasn't talking about basketball. But forgive him, please, for indulging in that all-too-American habit of lapsing into sports analogies at the drop of a bat. He's had a busy few years as head of the Federal Communications Commission and was announcing his decision to hang up his cleats. Just look what happened while he was on the mound: telephone deregulation, digital TV licenses, a push for cable competition, guiding the wireless revolution. And then, as further proof that his beat is a busy one, there were rumblings last week about a merger between AT&T and SBC Communications, a deal whose size would hit the old record out of the park. HOLLYWOOD The Dinosaurs of Summer Think of the great old movies -- ''Children of Paradise,'' say, or ''Notorious'' or ''Treasure of the Sierra Madre.'' If they had opened a week later, or a week earlier, would it have affected their greatness one iota? Of course not. But just look at summer movie madness now, at all the huffing and puffing about which mega-budget, mega-effects movie will land on a given weekend. Greatness? They don't need no stinkin' greatness -- they need blowout box-office numbers, and they need them now, before the next blockbuster barges in. ''Lost World'' certainly got them last weekend -- a record of more than $90 million. And for the blockbusters-in-waiting, lined up like snorting jumbo jets in the narrow alley out back, the summer suddenly seems a lot more spacious. Why? Because they learned that ''Titanic,'' the blowout of blowouts, with its $200 million price tag, won't be plowing into theaters until December. TELEPHONE ABUSE Just Let It Ring The telephone isn't all bad. None of its virtues come to mind, but there must be some. One big irritant: The oily voice comes on -- you can almost see the slicked-back hair, the loud tie -- promising breathlessly that if you buy a certain stock now, you'll be rich within minutes. Guaranteed. The more you balk, the oilier it gets -- flattery, knowing whispers, dramatic pauses, despairing sighs. (You pathetically timid worm, they seem to say.) Don't think for a moment, though, that these are spur-of-the-moment improvisations. Regulators from 20 states filed a flurry of lawsuits last week in an effort to crack down on penny-stock pestering -- a nuisance that has spread recently, feeding on a greed born of the soaring stock market. And the legal papers included dozens of scripts, laying out the whole oily sequence -- pause, flatter and sigh. TOBACCO WARS Blowing Smoke at Joe Camel R. J. Reynolds says its Joe Camel ads are not aimed at young smokers. But a Federal Trade Commission official called the ad campaign ''one of the most effective in decades,'' and the statistics bear that out: In 1987, when the ads first appeared in the United States, 3 percent of under-age smokers chose Camels; by 1993, it was 13.2 percent. And last week, for the first time, the F.T.C. made its displeasure official, accusing Reynolds of violating Federal laws by promoting lethal and addictive products to those not even old enough to buy them. Did this accusation add spice to the talks aimed at pinning down the tobacco industry's long-term liability? Perhaps. Last week antismoking advocates huddled in Chicago -- though not, presumably, in the proverbial smoke-filled room -- and urged negotiators not to rush into any deal. AUTOS Electric Cars, Humming Most people still think of electric cars as a pipe dream. But the cars are most definitely coming. They don't go far enough, you say? Well, their limited range seems to become less limited by the day. At the Tour de Sol recently -- a rally for such pipe dreams -- a converted Geo Metro went 249 miles without recharging. That's a record for ''production models'' -- which means at least five have been sold. More to the point, the average for production models jumped in a year from 141 miles to 168 -- closing in on the power of a tank of gas. But aren't they too slow? Not exactly. At the rally, one electric car was nabbed by police radar. One thing, though: being so quiet, will they sneak up on us, programmed as we are to listen, not always look, at intersections? Some are equipped with a pedestrian warning signal, but the driver must activate it. CAREER CHANGES Instant Journalist It was one of the more intriguing midcareer corrections, right up there with Sol Wachtler's segue from judge to felon, or Ronald Reagan's leap from Hollywood to the White House. Yes, when Susan Molinari, rising Republican star, turned her back on the political world -- for the moment, at least -- to become a CBS newscaster, some ungenerous souls pointed out that she sorely lacked journalistic credentials. But they were ignoring a central modern truth: a celebrity is a celebrity, period. If Michael Jordan turned up on the happy-talk news with one of those cute weather maps and told us it would snow tomorrow, we'd dig out the boots and shovels in a second. The question is: If snow falls on Republicans, will Ms. Molinari tell it like it is? And speaking of career switches: Jules Feiffer, indelibly linked with The Village Voice, left the paper last week. No, he wasn't downsized, but his paycheck would have been -- from $75,000 a year to zero -- even as the paper kept running his cartoons. BANKING, JUST BANKING Farewell, Cash-Flow Sonata Why would someone play a piano in a bank? It makes no sense, no sense at all. A bank is about money; music is about -- well, it's not about money. Harrumph. An official at Republic National's World Trade Center branch put it succinctly: ''This is a bank. It's not a concert hall.'' Yes, yes, a pianist named Anthony Polistina did delight bank customers there for 20 years, did add a multitude of soothing curves to an increasingly straight-ahead world, but that was clearly an aberration, an oversight. And last week Republic straightened out that oversight, banishing Mr. Polistina and his music to make way for new A.T.M.'s. There were cries of protest, of course, with customers circulating petitions and some even closing their accounts. But they just don't understand progress.",1997/06/01

Then, AT&T proposed to buy Teleport, a New York company that provides local phone service in more than 60 cities. Yet these are modest moves.

At the auto show last week, Volkswagen rolled out its new Beetle, which returns to the Lilliputian end of the United States market after a 21-year absence, while just a few booths away Ford unveiled its Brobdingnagian new F-250, a pickup whose hood ornament is further off the ground than Dr. Ruth Westheimer's chin. Car makers and critics braced for a struggle over the Yahooish way light trucks have of mangling most any car they hit broadside; manufacturers are quietly pushing to have new side-impact standards set no higher than in Europe, where, unlike here, big light trucks are scarce. But the news on the environmental front might please the Houyhnhnms, Swift's race of selfless, sagacious horses: the Big Three and several Japanese companies are talking seriously about making new high-technology, high-mileage cars in the next few model years, and Ford says it will voluntarily upgrade its light trucks to meet the much tougher emissions standards imposed on cars. PRICES Won't Be Undersold Wholesale prices fell two-tenths of a percent in December and 1.2 percent for all of 1997, the Labor Department announced, and the ''core'' rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy numbers, fell for the first time in memory last year. Analysts are calling the inflation outlook the best in a generation, with even the labor markets -- tight, by historical standards -- on good behavior. Among economists, fretting about inflation is beginning to give way to fretting about possible deflation and the economic harm that would come. JOBS Won't Be Idle The latest evidence from the astrophysics lab says the universe will keep expanding forever, a characteristic that the American economy and labor force seem to share these days. An unexpectedly plentiful 370,000 new jobs were created in December, but unemployment actually ticked up slightly because an even greater number of new workers entered the labor force, the Labor Department reported. A record 64.1 percent of American adults are now in the labor force, but it wasn't a salary bidding war that drew them in: Real hourly wages rose just 0.1 percent last month. BUDGETS You Mean There's Extra? President Clinton said he planned to submit a balanced budget to Congress for fiscal 1999, three years ahead of schedule, and predicted a comparatively trivial Federal deficit of about $22 billion for 1998. Wall Street yawned, having long since predicted that the strong economy would erase the deficit, but political leaders dived gleefully into an unaccustomed task: arguing over what to do with spare money. The President is expected to discuss new initiatives on child care and the environment in his State of the Union message later in the month; House Speaker Newt Gingrich is talking about tax cuts. Consumers are way ahead of Washington this time: They unexpectedly reversed a three-year borrowing binge in November, reducing their total indebtedness by $4.2 billion, according to Treasury Department figures released last week. ASIAN TURMOIL, PART I Rescues Needing Rescues It turns out not to be quite as simple as tossing out a multibillion-dollar life preserver and hauling in the rope. Financial rescue plans sponsored by the International Monetary Fund for several Asian countries showed signs of unraveling last week, largely because of the reluctance of the recipients to swim along quietly in the specified direction. Indonesia announced a new budget that blithely ignored the I.M.F.'s fiscal advice, and when the rescuers' displeasure became known, the country's currency and its stock market sank like stones. Dire rumors, panic buying and fears of political instability swept the country. And in Thailand, which was the first Asian domino to fall, I.M.F.-required austerity measures are already pinching too hard for the Prime Minister, who asked for an easing of the terms. ASIAN TURMOIL, PART II Devil in the Details Compared with Southeast Asia, South Korea seems calm. Its streets are quiet, and the stock market has stanched its bleeding. But the particulars of the debt restructuring the country badly needs are proving thorny. After a week of squabbling, creditor banks were near agreement on a plan to give the country a breather of 30 to 90 days on loan payments. Still to be sorted out is what happens next: who will buy a proposed bond issue and what kinds of government guarantees they will get. COMPUTERS New Year, New Prospects January is the time of year Steven Jobs likes to spring surprises: He introduced the Macintosh computer with a stunning ''1984''-themed commercial that ran just once, during that year's Super Bowl; since then new products from Apple Computer have often been announced at the January MacWorld trade show. Mr. Jobs's show stopper this year was his announcement that Apple had managed a small profit in the first quarter of its 1998 fiscal year. The crisis is far from over for the company Mr. Jobs founded -- and is now trying to turn around after a three-year slide in other hands -- but Wall Street was delighted by the progress so far, pushing Apple's stock up 20 percent. TELECOMMUNICATIONS Buying Local Why invent what you can buy instead? SBC Communications, which bought Pacific Telesis in 1996 in the first merger among the Baby Bells, has announced a deal to acquire Connecticut's phone company, Southern New England Telephone, one of the few remaining sizable independents, for $4.4 billion. One lure: S.N.E.T. has regulatory permission to sell long-distance service to its local customers, a privilege so far denied to SBC and its former Bell siblings. And AT&T was attracted by a 26-state local franchise when it agreed last week to buy Teleport Communications for $11.3 billion in stock.

The Dow Jones industrial average, rising steadily for almost two months, gained 25.41 points, to 8,775.40, its third consecutive record. In a year when few Wall Street analysts expected to Dow to gain double-digits, the blue-chip average is already up 11 percent, one of its best starts this decade. After three spectacular years of share price gains, the market is once again strengthening against a backdrop of solid economic growth, heavy cash flows into mutual funds and speculation that more and more companies will merge, pushing share prices even higher. The brokerage industry -- one of the prime benefactors of this bull market -- has been both a source of tremendous profit growth, driven by an increasingly investment-hungry populace, and heavy speculation about new banking combinations. Yesterday, for instance, talk that the Chase Manhattan Corporation might merge with Merrill Lynch sent Merrill's shares up more than 9 percent, despite denials among industry insiders that a deal was pending. Chase and Merrill declined comment. Shares of Chase also rose a day after the nation's biggest commercial bank said it would cut 4,500 jobs, by laying off 2,250 employees and not replacing the others, in the next 18 months. In the last three years, brokerage stocks, as calculated in the American Stock Exchange's security and broker-dealer index, are up about 500 percent, partly because of new combinations such as Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter and the merger of Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney, which is part of the Travelers Group. Shares of several regional telephone companies also rose yesterday after Edward Whitacre, Jr., the chairman of SBC Communications, said he might be interested in buying another local phone company. It has been that kind of a market. Earnings growth may be eroding, but analysts say investors believe the economy will remain strong, and the eagerness to own stocks is greater than ever. Since the Dow fell 554 points last Oct. 27 to hit 7,161.15 on fears of a deepening economic crisis in Southeast Asia, the average has risen 1,614 points, or 22.5 percent. Even ardent bulls are wondering whether the market has risen too fast. ''The momentum unleashed in the last few weeks means we're going to go to the extreme on the greed side,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards Inc. ''People have lots of money and they don't want to leave a winning game.'' Shares of energy companies gained after oil prices rebounded from a series of declines. Exxon and Chevron were among the leading Dow component stocks. Investors also bought up technology shares despite recent profit warnings. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.98 points to close at a record 1,788.28. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.07 points to close at a record 1,085.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 1.07, to a record 427.18. Richard Eakle, an analyst and president of Eakle Associates in Fair Haven, N.J., said the market has been buoyed by middle-aged investors who see stocks as the fountain of wealth. ''The primary catalyst is the baby- boomer generation liquidity situation,'' he said. ''That generation is going to invest as much as they can.''",1998/03/19

And in June, as Russia lurched toward a financial crisis that set off global shock waves, the House of Unions was rented for a glittering celebration of capitalism, with one of the country's most ardent bankers, Goldman, Sachs & Company, as its host. Goldman flew in former President George Bush, paying him more than $100,000, and entertained Russia's former Prime Minister.

As new forms of digital communication have swept the nation and hundreds of companies have emerged to provide them, landlords of apartment buildings and office towers have had an almost inviolable right to determine which companies may set up shop inside their properties. Now that may begin to change. Government officials and industry executives said commission members and their staffs were still battling over the proposals yesterday afternoon and it was possible the F.C.C. could postpone any action. But whether the issue is addressed today or in the near future, the battle lines have been drawn. Consider 450 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, a building near 44th Street that includes the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell, a law firm, and Cline Davis & Mann, an advertising agency. Hines Interests, the building's manager, holds stakes in Broadband Office and Allied Riser Communications, young companies that wire office buildings and offer advanced communications services. Hines has allowed the two to install equipment at 450 Lexington and has yet to give other carriers the same access. Davis Polk and Cline Davis refused to comment, as did Broadband Office. But communications companies that think they are being shut out, as well as some consumer advocates, have not hesitated to attack a system they say is unfair. ''Given the paucity of local communications competition that has emerged since the telecommunications deregulation act of 1996, it's absolutely critical to use every mechanism possible to jump-start greater consumer access to multiple telecommunications providers,'' Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, said yesterday. ''This would be one step forward for breaking down barriers to local competition.'' Others see the matter differently. ''To us, a building is a community,'' said Steve Peterson, a vice president at Hines, a commercial real estate company based in Houston. ''In Texas alone there are 419 registered CLEC's,'' he added, using industry jargon for competitive local exchange carriers. ''Can we have 419 carriers and their equipment in our building? The answer is no.'' ''We're not trying to exclude anybody,'' he said. ''But we want to make sure that all of the carriers are there for the long haul, and yes, we want to maintain a little bit of control over the process. It's our building, after all.'' The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the commission to foster increased competition in local markets, and the F.C.C. chairman, William E. Kennard, a Democrat, has made that a primary goal. But realizing that any attempt to exert direct jurisdiction over landlords would be fraught with political and perhaps legal difficulties, the commission appeared to be leaning toward trying to deal with the controversy indirectly. Rather than regulate landlords, the F.C.C. was considering issuing rules that would prohibit carriers from agreeing to exclusive real estate deals, according to industry executives and people close to the commission. Under the proposal, the carriers, who almost always are subject to regulatory certification, would not be allowed to sign a contract under which they would be the only company allowed to install a network in an office building. In addition, the commission appeared to be leaning toward requiring communications carriers to share their space within office buildings with competitors. To serve business customers who spend thousands of dollars a month on communications services, some companies prefer to install advanced antennas on roofs. Others like to put some sort of switch or router in the basement. Many want to install wiring throughout the building. The landlords control a company's ability to deploy its system. If this fight sounds familiar, it should. In many ways, the debate is just the latest variation of AT&T's battle to retain control over Internet services delivered over its cable system, or, for that matter, the fight over whether America Online must open its instant messaging system to rivals. With some exceptions, landlords have almost the same power in apartment buildings as in office towers. But the issue has become ripe in the business sector because some carriers prefer to install equipment in the buildings of businesses they serve. Such equipment is generally not required to serve residential consumers. The conflict over access to commercial buildings is bubbling over just now because the real estate industry is more involved than ever in the communications business. Landlords are taking financial stakes in new carriers in exchange for giving those carriers the sometimes exclusive right to install equipment. Phone giants like Verizon Communications and SBC Communications, which already have lines into almost all the roughly 750,000 office buildings across the nation, have not been on the front lines of this debate. Those with complaints are generally smaller, newer companies. ''We're seeing an increasing amount of landlords who are interested in choice only to the extent that they have taken a financial interest in a carrier,'' said David S. Turetsky, a senior vice president at Teligent Inc., a new local communications company, and a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department. ''What they all have in common is that none of those models respects the ultimate choice of the tenant.'' Broadband Office was formed by a consortium of real estate companies, together with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm. Joey D. Mooring, a spokesman for Allied Riser, said his company had granted warrants, a form of equity ownership similar to stock options, to some real estate companies that have opened their buildings, but would not be specific. ''Tenants within the buildings should have the ability to choose who their provider is,'' he said. As a business proposition, lobbyists for the real estate industry tend to agree. But as a matter of regulation, they say the government has no right to tell landlords who can and cannot come in. ''This is something that's driven by the tenant market, and tenant choice is the way for people in the real estate industry to be successful,'' said Roger Platt, spokesman for the Real Access Alliance. This group, formed by many of the nation's biggest real estate companies, has lobbied the F.C.C. to back off. ''Building owners are being portrayed as evil characters out of a Dickens novel,'' he said. ''One of the fundamental aspects of being a manager of property is you have the right to both include certain people and to exclude certain individuals. There are narrow constitutional restrictions on that, but otherwise the Constitution is very clear.'' That argument has found some resonance at the F.C.C. At least one commissioner, Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican, has made it clear from the start that the case for forced access is weak at best, said Helgi Walker, a legal adviser to Mr. Furchtgott-Roth. ''Even if such statutory authority were within the discretion of the commission,'' she said, ''the exercise of that discretionary authority would at least raise questions about the constitutionality of its action.'' Taking a page from AT&T's playbook, the Real Access Alliance has suggested voluntary guidelines for preserving competition. In addition to other rules, the commission may make a point of trying to hold the alliance's members to those commitments. Some communications experts suggested that having taken intermediate efforts would be a necessary building block in any future effort to regulate property owners more directly. In the end, however, the companies that have complained appear more interested in getting fast access to buildings than in helping the F.C.C. expand its jurisdiction. ''The point is really to create a process that shortens something that already works,'' said William J. Rouhana Jr., chairman of Winstar Communications, a new local carrier. ''We get access to a lot of buildings, but it takes us an average of nine months to do it. Almost every landlord starts out wondering if they shouldn't consider doing an exclusive, and once that's off the table then the whole process is shortened.''",2000/10/12

So far, Verizon Communications Inc. has been allowed to offer long distance in New York and SBC in Texas. SBC is known as an aggressive company, and yesterday's application was an aggressive regulatory move.

The measure, a bill to deregulate the high-speed Internet market, has become known informally on Capitol Hill as the big bucks bill of the year, although it has little chance of becoming law any time soon. As a result, experts predict it will continue to be lucrative for lawmakers for years to come, encouraging the telecommunications industry to find ways to make tens of millions of dollars in contributions long after Congress completes its work on the campaign finance legislation.

Today, the industry is awaiting an early-stage decision in the case of British Telcommunications v. Prodigy, another closely watched patent fight that, as have many before it, challenges a ubiquitous computing operation. At a preliminary hearing in a federal court in Westchester County, N.Y., last month, British Telecommunications, a subsidiary of the BT Group, asserted that it owned a patent on what is now known as hyperlinking, the process of linking Web pages so users can move from one page to another by simply clicking on highlighted text. Hyperlinking, a function about as basic to the Web as ramps are to a highway, is used by nearly every Web page, so that virtually no browsing can take place without it. According to British Telecom's arguments, without the technology that the company says is covered in its patent, now nearly 13 years old, computer users would have to know the address of a page before they could jump to it.",2002/03/11

In reality, they still have such a great percentage.'' In 2000, an Oklahoma jury awarded the plaintiffs $7.4 million in damages. State antitrust law permits the damages to be tripled, bringing the total to more than $22 million, plus lawyers' fees. The award could eventually total $29 million to $30 million, including interest, Robert Edinger, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said. The judges said that Southwestern Bell froze out competition through long-term contracts with the owners of sites for pay phones. The contracts included stiff penalties for early termination. Southwestern also ''employed several other measures to freeze out competition,'' including failing to remove its pay phones when site owners requested removal, the judges wrote.

The change would be the culmination of a long campaign by the nation's biggest media conglomerates, which are intent on entering new local markets and expanding in those where they already have a presence. And it would come despite objections from an array of politically liberal and conservative critics who fear broad consolidation in the news and entertainment businesses.",2003/06/02

Wireless companies like Cingular sell calling packages that include 900 minutes for as little as $39.99 a month. Under MinuteShare, a Cingular customer paying a fixed monthly fee for a certain number of minutes could use those minutes to make long-distance calls over the SBC or BellSouth networks, an SBC spokesman, Michael Coe, said.

But he would have appreciated the predicament of the San Francisco Giants and their fans this week, as they waited for Barry Bonds to return to the lineup. Bonds, the seven-time National League most valuable player who is threatening to eclipse Hank Aaron's record for career home runs, played in what the Giants called a simulated game at SBC Park on Thursday afternoon, though it was not much more than a few rounds of batting practice against live pitching. He even sent a fastball from a young right-hander named Kevin Correia into the right-field bleachers. But when the real game against the Chicago Cubs began a few hours later, he was back where he has been all season: on the disabled list.",2005/09/09

Bonds, the San Francisco Giants' slugger, fouled off five pitches before doubling in his first at-bat since having three operations on his right knee in eight months. The ball left the park in left-center, but only because a fan reached down and deflected it into the stands. The crowd of 39,095 at SBC Park was momentarily delirious as the scoreboard flashed 704. Many thought Bonds, who is third on the major league career home run list with 703, had moved one closer to Babe Ruth's 714 and Hank Aaron's 755.",2005/09/13

The chickens had been gone for a while, but they were back in celebration of the return of Barry Bonds to the Giants' lineup. The 41-year-old Bonds cracked a double in his first at-bat after missing all season because of three operations on his right knee. The Giants beat the first-place San Diego Padre and Bonds was back in the lineup Tuesday, starting in left field. That means the chickens will probably be out in a flock for the rest of the season.

Benitez, the San Francisco Giants' closer, could not find the strike zone with a two-run lead, so he could have used some good luck in trying to lock up a storybook sweep of the San Diego Padres. Pedro Feliz, using a bat that Bonds had discarded, put San Francisco ahead by 4-2 with a two-run double in the eighth inning.

Michael J. De La Cruz, its vice president for sales and marketing, said that bigotry -- the company is owned by Mexican-Americans -- accounted for some of the problem. But the bigger part was that Group O Direct, though it had been around since 1974, did not know how to navigate corporate shoals. Then, in 2001, SBC Communications, seeking more minority vendors, took Group O Direct, in Milan, Ill., under its wing. ''They led us through their procurement process, what certifications we needed, how to write a bid, who to contact, how to set prices,'' Mr. De La Cruz said. SBC then gave Group O Direct a small contract. A few years later, the Microsoft Corporation helped Group O Direct further ''enhance and refine our business processes,'' as Mr. De La Cruz put it, then gave the company a contract, too. One result is that Group O Direct's revenues will probably exceed $50 million this year.",2005/09/20
