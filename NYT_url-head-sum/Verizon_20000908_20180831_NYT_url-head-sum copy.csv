From a base in East Anglia during World War II, 19 year old Howard Sloan flew 33 missions over Germany. His B-24 was named ""The Stork Club."" When praised for his bravery, he would invariably respond: ""Was there a choice?"" Cheers erupted from a crowd on the beach when, piloting his plane home to the states after the war, he dipped his wings over the Inwood Country Club. Mr. Sloan was born in New York City on March 20, 1924. He graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Pawling Preparatory School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, Class of '45W. He and his late wife, Sonny, along with George and Barbara Bush, were the only two married couples on campus. Dreams of business school were dashed by financial necessity and he joined his father's insurance company, Harris, Sloan and Finn. Characteristically, he turned the experience into a colorful one, representing clients such as Restaurant Associates; Richard Burton, who dispatched him to Rome to deliver a diamond he'd bought at auction for Elizabeth Taylor, or Cartier to present a love bracelet to Valentino, who insisted Howard personally fasten it on his wrist. He became an art insurer, developing great interest and knowledge of art in the process, befriending numerous artists and inspiring a lifetime of collecting: Mayan and PreColumbian sculpture, works by artists as diverse as Giacometti and Bill King, Henry Moore and Lindner. He acquired an art gallery, Multiples, for his wife, Sonny, and Marian Goodman to run. In 1990, he was invited by his friend and mentor, Charles Wohlstetter, to become a partner in the latter's acquisitions of hundreds of independent telephone companies from Alaska to California. They formed Continental Telephone, later known as Contel, in 1962. The company then agreed to be acquired by GTE, a combination that created the nation's largest local telephone company. Sloan remained on the Board of GTE until it was restructured as Verizon. In 1968, an American syndicate acquired an 18th century chateau in Bordeaux with Wohlstetter and Sloan installed as new owners. Chateau Bouscaut was the second most beautiful vineyard in Bordeaux, Sloan proclaimed, second, he said, because he didn't want to boast. Among the many American guests who flocked to visit, his favorite was Mary Lindsay, whom he overheard saying to her husband, then mayor of NYC, ""John, if I have to see one more vineyard, I'll kill myself."" To Sloan's eternal regret, Bouscat was sold in 1980. Mayor Lindsay brought Sloan onto the board of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1984. At that time, according to Andre Bishop, current artistic director, ""Nobody would give you a nickel for the Beaumont."" It is now one of the leading theatrical companies in New York, if not the world. Mr. Sloan served on the Board until his death on Thursday. In 1977, Sloan joined the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center, of which he was Chairman from 1993 to 2000, nominating his successor, Howard Milstein. In January 2013, a congressional extension prepared by Representative Carolyn Maloney in recognition of Mr. Sloan's 15 years of distinguished service and dedication to NYBC's mission, was entered into the congressional record. She cited his humanitarian status and commended his leadership and tireless advocacy. For several years, he presided as Chairman of Northside Center for Child Development, founded by Kenneth and Mamie Clarke, earning a colleague's recent comment, ""There was a time this place wouldn't have existed without Howard Sloan."" He and his wife are to be honored for their dedication to Northside at a gala in May 2017. Howard Sloan died of kidney failure in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on January 21, 2016. Handsome as a film star, he will be remembered for his elegance and extraordinary wit. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Massachusetts, Gillis Cone of Woodbury, Connecticut; a son, Douglas Sloan, of Palm Beach; a stepdaughter, Paulette Bartlett Robinson, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren. Interment will be private and a memorial service will take place at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home on Wednesday, February 10th. 1/3",
