Lauder, a refugee of Nazi-occupied Europe who married into an illustrious family in the beauty business and became an ardent advocate for breast cancer awareness, raising millions for research, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 75. The cause was nongenetic ovarian cancer, said Alexandra Trower, a spokeswoman for the Estée Lauder Companies. As the wife of Leonard A. Lauder, the chairman emeritus of the Estée Lauder Companies, and as the daughter-in-law of the company's formidable matriarch, Estée Lauder, Evelyn Lauder had to establish her own place in a family as complex as it was competitive. Mrs. Lauder frequently told the story of how, early in her marriage, she returned to the couple's apartment to find that Estée had rearranged the furniture more to her liking. When Evelyn and Leonard were dating -- it was only their second date -- Estée implored her to stay and be the hostess for a birthday party she was giving her son. ''So I stayed,'' Mrs. Lauder said in an interview in 2008. ''What could I do? She was like a steamroller.'' Yet it was clear that Estée was crazy about the young woman, and soon after Evelyn's marriage, in 1959, she joined the family cosmetics company, then a small enterprise, pitching in wherever she was needed. ''I was very strong,'' she said. ''Having had a childhood like the one I had, I was much more tough than a lot of people. I was one of the few people who spoke my mind to Estée.'' Mrs. Lauder learned she had breast cancer in 1989 and soon became a strong voice on behalf of women's health, though she was always reluctant to discuss her own condition. ''My situation doesn't really matter,'' she told a reporter in 1995. She was a creator of the Pink Ribbon campaign, a worldwide symbol of breast health, and in 1993 she founded the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which has raised more than $350 million. In 2007 she received a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, which developed independently of her breast cancer, Ms. Trower said. Evelyn Hausner was born on Aug. 12, 1936, in Vienna, the only child of Ernest and Mimi Hausner. Her father, a dapper man who lived in Poland and Berlin before marrying the daughter of a Viennese lumber supplier, owned a lingerie shop. In 1938, with Hitler's annexation of Austria, the family left Vienna, taking a few belongings, including household silver, which Ernest Hausner used to obtain visas to Belgium. The family eventually reached England, where Evelyn's mother was immediately sent to an internment camp on the Isle of Man. ''The separation was very traumatic for me,'' Mrs. Lauder said. Her father placed her in a nursery until her mother could be released and he could raise money. In 1940, the family set sail for New York, where her father worked as a diamond cutter during the war. In 1947, he and his wife bought a dress shop in Manhattan called Lamay. Over time they expanded it to a chain of five shops. Mrs. Lauder grew up on West 86th Street and attended Public School 9. During her freshman year at Hunter College, she met Leonard Lauder on a blind date. Already graduated from college and training to be a naval officer, Mr. Lauder had grown up on West 76th Street, though in a sense it was a world apart. ''He was the first person who took me out to dinner in a restaurant,'' she recalled. They married four years later at the Plaza Hotel. Though always at home by 4 p.m. when her two children were little, Mrs. Lauder said she never considered being a stay-at-home mom, in spite of the family's growing wealth. ''I couldn't bear it,'' she said. ''I grew up with a working mother.'' Mrs. Lauder was also a public school teacher for several years. She held many roles at Estée Lauder, including creator of training programs and director of new products and marketing. In 1989, the year of her breast cancer diagnosis, she became the senior corporate vice president and head of fragrance development worldwide. Mrs. Lauder is survived by her husband; her sons, William and Gary; and five grandchildren. Though Mrs. Lauder, an avid photographer, had a home in Colorado and a penthouse on Fifth Avenue lined with modern art, she and her husband liked to retreat to a plain cabin in Putnam County, N.Y., where Mrs. Lauder might serve guests German food she had prepared. Asked once how she felt about working with her husband in the early days, she replied, ''Working with Leonard was a riot.'' Indeed, she joked that he had such a sense of business, without family favoritism, that getting an appointment with him was sometimes tough. ''It would take me much longer to get a date with him,'' she said, ''than someone who didn't have his name.''

Soon I bought a pair of the updated Nike Free Run+ 2 and Lunar Glides (both in all black with a white tread). More recently I added Lunar Glides+ 3 (yellow tread with black upper, touch of aqua) and replaced my worn-out Frees. And my running followed, going from the treadmill to the road, from 3 miles to 10. I'm not special: running and running shoes are cool right now. But a random fashion trend this is not.

In an opinion released on Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the former employee, Sergey Aleynikov, had not violated the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 or federal stolen property laws. The opinion elaborates on the February decision by a three-judge panel of the appeals court to overturn Mr. Aleynikov's conviction, a reversal that dealt a blow to one of the most prominent federal prosecutions of corporate espionage in recent years.",

D, An experimental physicist, engineer, and computer scientist, died on January 2, 2012 at the age of 76. He, in partnership with Ken Thompson, created Belle, a pioneering combination of computer and special hardware that played championship-quality chess. Joseph was born in Princeton, NJ on February 15, 1935, to Emilie Honzik Condon and the noted theoretical physicist, Edward Uhler (E. U.) Condon, and was named after the 19th century American physicist, Joseph Henry. Joe earned a B.S. in physics from Johns Hopkins University and a Ph.D. in physics from Northwestern University. He and his wife of 51 years, Carol (nee Merklinger) Condon, Ph.D., have resided in Summit, NJ since 1963, when Joseph joined AT&T Bell Laboratories at Murray Hill, NJ. Joseph started his research career at Bell Labs in low temperature solid-state physics. His initial research centered on developing an ultra-sensitive torsion balance to study the electronic band structure of metals. His seminal research on the low temperature behavior of pure metals showed that, under certain conditions, magnetic domains can form in nonmagnetic metals such as beryllium. He developed a theory of such domains and obtained experimental verification of his theory. He had wide ranging interests, and it was difficult to remain focused on low temperature solid-state physics when a digital revolution was in progress. In 1968 he contributed to the emerging technologies of digital switching and produced many patents in that area. By 1975 Joe had joined the Computer Research Center at Bell Labs where, around the same time, the C programming language and the Unix operating system were created. Joe collaborated with Sandy Fraser to automate the laborious and error-prone task of manually converting a circuit drawing into a circuit board by designing the Unix Circuit Design System (UCDS). This system launched an era of rapid prototype construction for research and product development. The purpose of another of Joe's projects was to convince AT&T's development organizations to adopt the C programming language for their switching system control programs. To this end, it was decided that C should be used to reprogram an existing switch. Joe made the necessary hardware changes and Ken Thompson wrote the necessary software programs so that the re-write in C was a success and hastened the adoption of C for all switching system's software within AT&T. Another major collaboration between Joe and Ken Thompson was the creation of the chess-playing machine named Belle. Joe designed custom hardware while Ken designed the software. The hardware evaluated board position, did piece move generation, and used a cache memory for previously evaluated board positions. Belle's hardware could evaluate millions of board positions and generate all legal chess moves every second. The control software kept track of how many moves ahead the hardware was evaluating and selected the best current move. Belle achieved a master rating. It won the World Computer Chess Championship in 1980 and the ACM North American Computer Chess Championships in 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1986. Joseph was a physicist and engineer noted for his insight and intuition into physical systems and for talented digital system design. His designs were parsimonious and supremely effective, yet his collaborations were generous and never compromised by ego. Joe had a delightful sense of humor and unlimited curiosity. He loved to travel with Carol in their recreational vehicle and loved American Indian crafts, classical music, and the theatre. He was very active in The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and was a frequent volunteer in the FISH Hospitality Program. In addition to his beloved wife, Carol, Dr. Condon is survived by a brother, Paul Edward Condon, Ph.D., of Lafayette, CO, and was predeceased by a sister, Marie Condon Thornton of Berkeley, CA. Other survivors include a sister-in-law and husband, many nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews.

D, An experimental physicist, engineer, and computer scientist, died on January 2, 2012 at the age of 76. He, in partnership with Ken Thompson, created Belle, a pioneering combination of computer and special hardware that played championship-quality chess. Joseph was born in Princeton, NJ on February 15, 1935, to Emilie Honzik Condon and the noted theoretical physicist, Edward Uhler (E. U.) Condon, and was named after the 19th century American physicist, Joseph Henry. Joe earned a B.S. in physics from Johns Hopkins University and a Ph.D. in physics from Northwestern University. He and his wife of 51 years, Carol (nee Merklinger) Condon, Ph.D., have resided in Summit, NJ since 1963, when Joseph joined AT&T Bell Laboratories at Murray Hill, NJ. Joseph started his research career at Bell Labs in low temperature solid-state physics. His initial research centered on developing an ultra-sensitive torsion balance to study the electronic band structure of metals. His seminal research on the low temperature behavior of pure metals showed that, under certain conditions, magnetic domains can form in nonmagnetic metals such as beryllium. He developed a theory of such domains and obtained experimental verification of his theory. He had wide ranging interests, and it was difficult to remain focused on low temperature solid-state physics when a digital revolution was in progress. In 1968 he contributed to the emerging technologies of digital switching and produced many patents in that area. By 1975 Joe had joined the Computer Research Center at Bell Labs where, around the same time, the C programming language and the Unix operating system were created. Joe collaborated with Sandy Fraser to automate the laborious and error-prone task of manually converting a circuit drawing into a circuit board by designing the Unix Circuit Design System (UCDS). This system launched an era of rapid prototype construction for research and product development. The purpose of another of Joe's projects was to convince AT&T's development organizations to adopt the C programming language for their switching system control programs. To this end, it was decided that C should be used to reprogram an existing switch. Joe made the necessary hardware changes and Ken Thompson wrote the necessary software programs so that the re-write in C was a success and hastened the adoption of C for all switching system's software within AT&T. Another major collaboration between Joe and Ken Thompson was the creation of the chess-playing machine named Belle. Joe designed custom hardware while Ken designed the software. The hardware evaluated board position, did piece move generation, and used a cache memory for previously evaluated board positions. Belle's hardware could evaluate millions of board positions and generate all legal chess moves every second. The control software kept track of how many moves ahead the hardware was evaluating and selected the best current move. Belle achieved a master rating. It won the World Computer Chess Championship in 1980 and the ACM North American Computer Chess Championships in 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1986. Joseph was a physicist and engineer noted for his insight and intuition into physical systems and for talented digital system design. His designs were parsimonious and supremely effective, yet his collaborations were generous and never compromised by ego. Joe had a delightful sense of humor and unlimited curiosity. He loved to travel with Carol in their recreational vehicle and loved American Indian crafts, classical music, and the theatre. He was very active in The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and was a frequent volunteer in the FISH Hospitality Program. In addition to his beloved wife, Carol, Dr. Condon is survived by a brother, Paul Edward Condon, Ph.D., of Lafayette, CO, and was predeceased by a sister, Marie Condon Thornton of Berkeley, CA. Other survivors include a sister-in-law and husband, many nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews. A memorial service will be held at 2pm on Saturday, April 28 at the Plainfield Meeting House of The Religious Society of Friends, 225 Watchung Ave., Plainfield, NJ 07060.

Dearly loved husband, father, grandfather, brother, brother-in-law, and friend died on July 16th at home in Lakeville, CT more than five years after his diagnosis of lung cancer. He was 70. Vance grew up in Alexandria, VA where his lifelong fascination with history and government began. Although he was a nominee for a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship he instead chose a career in law. After graduating from the Georgetown University Law Center he joined the Employee Benefits Division of the American National Bank & Trust Co. in Chicago. He returned to Washington, DC to join the United States House of Representatives Committee on Education & Labor. He was its Chief Counsel and Staff Director-Pension Task Force. The work of this committee led to the passage of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Subsequently he held positions with the American Bankers Association and then rejoined the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education & Labor to focus on the passage of the Multi-employer Pension Plan Act of 1980. His work in employment law continued after joining Mobil Oil Corporation as Employee Relations Counsel and Assistant Secretary. He then served as Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of Allied Signal Inc. He joined Merrill Lynch's Office of the General Counsel in 1998 initially acting as an advisor to its Retirement Group. Despite his diagnosis of cancer in 2007, he continued to work virtually uninterrupted until early 2012. His most recent position was Managing Director and Associate General Counsel of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. He is survived by his wife, Margaret Monaco; his son James Anderson, daughter-in-law Virginia Grandison, their children Emma and James, Jr.; his daughter Emily Anderson, son-in-law David Natt, their children Sydney, Sam, and Sophie; his daughter Heather (Anderson) Donnelly, son-in-law Brian Donnelly, their children George and Abigail; his daughter Meaghan Anderson; his sister Jane (Anderson) Cram; nieces, nephews, grand nephews, sisters and brothers-in-law.

But the subtext of the deal is a different story, showing how two of technology's most powerful players are teaming up to create a greater balance of power on the Internet - a market that has been tilted decisively in favor of one company, Google, for years. ''This is almost certainly a move against Google,'' said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst at Altimeter Group, a research firm. The agreement between Microsoft and Facebook, announced on Monday, came less than two weeks after Microsoft agreed to pay more than $1 billion for 925 patents held by AOL. In a second deal, Microsoft said it had turned around and sold 70 percent of those same patents - about 650 in all - to Facebook for $550 million in cash, along with rights to 275 AOL patents Microsoft plans to retain. While Facebook and Microsoft have not yet determined precisely how they are going to divvy up the patents, it is expected that Facebook will end up with a range of patents involving mobile, Web and instant messaging technologies. Microsoft is likely to keep AOL patents involving search, among other things. The arrangement will help Facebook bulk up its intellectual property portfolio before its ini tial public offering, which is expected next month, and it is a further sign of the growing importance of stockpiling patents in the arsenal of any big technology company. ''This is another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook's interests over the long term,'' Ted Ullyot, general counsel of Facebook, said in a statement. The deal could also give Facebook additional ammunition in its escalating patent feud with Yahoo. Yahoo sued Facebook earlier this year, claiming violations of Yahoo patents, many related to online advertising. Facebook subsequently countersued Yahoo, in a pattern that is playing out again and again in different parts of the technology business, especially the mobile phone market. But in large part the deal is evidence of how Microsoft and Facebook have gravitated ever closer to each other in part because of a common enemy, Google. Google has menaced Microsoft's business on a number of fronts, including with free online Google applications that compete with Microsoft Office and with Android, a mobile operating system that competes with Microsoft's Windows Phone software. As Facebook has evolved into a Web behemoth, with 900 million active monthly users, Google has become increasingly focused on tamping down the challenge to its business from the social network, introducing Google Plus, a rival social service. Google's big concern is that the bounty of data Facebook has about its users, including their tastes and friend connections, will turn it into a serious rival for online advertising dollars. There is also wide speculation that Facebook will start its own Internet search engine to rival Google. ''Microsoft is simply less concerned about the threat of social to its business than Google is,'' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm, explaining why Microsoft is not concerned about competition with Facebook. ''This may be a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend,'' he added. Jim Prosser, a Google spokesman, declined to comment. Microsoft has spent the last several years forging deeper connections with Facebook at every turn. Long stymied in its efforts to create an Internet search engine that effectively competed against Google, Microsoft two years ago struck a deal with Facebook to use data from the social network in Microsoft's Bing search engine to create more relevant search results. But the arrangement has not helped dislodge Google from its position of supremacy in Internet search. Years before that, Microsoft tried to acquire Facebook, but the social network's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, rebuffed the offer. Those conversations subsequently led to Microsoft's taking a small stake in Facebook, from which it stands to profit handsomely after the company goes public. In March, Google accounted for 66.4 percent of Internet searches in the United States, unchanged from the same month a year earlier, while Microsoft was in second place with 15.3 percent of the market, according to comScore. Microsoft's Bing search engine also supplies search results for Yahoo, which accounted for 13.7 percent of the search market during March. Microsoft has continued to lose money on Bing, including more than $2.6 billion in operating losses for its online division during its last fiscal year. Some executives within Microsoft have advocated selling Bing to another company, with the idea that a company better focused on the Internet market could pose a more credible challenge to Google, according to severalpeople with knowledge of the discussions who didn't want to be identified talking about internal deliberations.Over a year ago, Microsoft executives sent out feelers to Facebook to see if the company would be interested in acquiring Bing, though the overture was not officially sanctioned by Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, one of these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg declined, saying Facebook had too much else to concentrate on. Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment, as did Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook. In its original patent deal with AOL, Microsoft either bought or won the ability to assign about 925 patents and patent applications, along with a license to several hundred other patents AOL did not sell as part of an auction of its intellectual property. If the deal announced Monday clears regulatory scrutiny, Microsoft would still own about 275 AOL patents and retain a license to the 650 patents that Facebook will own. In addition, Microsoft is granting Facebook a license to the 275 AOL patents that it is keeping. Yahoo's legal attack on Facebook came at a sensitive time, as the company nears an expected initial public offering. In a statement, Yahoo said the deal with Microsoft will not deter its lawsuit against Facebook. ''Nothing about today's action changes the fact that Facebook continues to infringe our patents,'' Yahoo said in the statement. ''Companies who purchase patents are often working from a position of weakness and take these actions to strengthen their portfolio. We see today's announcement as a validation of our case against Facebook.'' The deal with Facebook puts Microsoft in an awkward position since it could help strengthen one close partner at the expense of another, Yahoo. ''We are very sensitive to the importance of our relationship with both Facebook and Yahoo,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel said in an interview. ''We have enormous respect for the value of the Yahoo patent portfolio. Yahoo has been an important innovator in the Internet space.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",

In his article, Keefe does a masterful job of depicting the complexity of the drug trade, showing the lengths to which the Sinaloa cartel will go to feed demand in the United States. Some form of legalization would allow these drugs to be produced more cheaply and thus cut into the cartels' profits. It would also reduce their ability to hire enforcers, bribe officials and transport their products across borders. A less muscular enemy might then give law-enforcement bodies a fighting chance.

One thing is certain, however: Google is not giving up. It is heading to retail outlets, showcasing the machines as cheap and easy to manage corporate devices, and rethinking how it sells products for education. Executives involved with Chrome say Google doesn't care if it takes years for the Chrome operating system to catch on. (Google also calls its Web browser Chrome.)",

He attended local schools until the age of 15, was graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts in 1939, and from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.), Cambridge, MA in 1943 with a degree in chemical engineering and business administration.

Since the pages of The New York Times Magazine close more than a week before they hit newsstands, we can't outrun the news. So this week's interview with the C.E.O. of Netflix, Reed Hastings, provided some rare deadline drama. On Oct. 6, just as we were putting the finishing touches on the interview for the Oct. 16 issue, I got an e-mail from Netflix with the subject line ""URGENT."" If the magazine ran the interview with Hastings as planned, The New York Times would look ""foolish."" My contact refused to offer me any specifics about what was afoot, but he said I would understand early the following week. He was good on his word. The initial interview - in which Hastings provided his justification for spinning off the disc-only service of his company into Qwikster - would have made us look pretty dopey had we published almost a week after Netflix announced that it was ditching Qwikster altogether. So we quickly put moved up our Melissa McCarthy interview to run in Hastings's place.
