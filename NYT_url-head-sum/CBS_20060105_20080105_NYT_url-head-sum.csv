1903,,THE WEEK AHEAD: Feb. 18 - 24; THEATER,http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EEDA163EF93BA25751C0A9619C8B63,"At times it can seem as if every working solo performer is imitating either SPALDING GRAY or ERIC BOGOSIAN. These artists, who were once the epitome of downtown cool, helped invent the monologue for a generation of writer-actors who have gone on, of course, to beat the form to death. As he got older, Mr. Gray graduated from the Wooster Group to performances uptown, where he dug deeper and deeper into his personal life, and questions of fame and depression, until his suicide in 2004. Mr. Bogosian has generally moved beyond his monologues, which once made Frank Rich of The Times compare him to Lenny Bruce, Bob Dylan and Woody Allen, all in the same sentence. He has kept a lower profile and branched out into novels and Hollywood movies. In the past year there has been a revival of interest in both Mr. Bogosian and Mr. Gray, and this week you can see some of their formative work. LIEV SCHREIBER stars in one of Mr. Bogosian's breakout works, ''TALK RADIO,'' a drama about a fear monger who makes Bill O'Reilly and Howard Stern look polite. The play, which had its premiere at the Public in 1987, was the first time that audiences saw Mr. Bogosian expand past the monologue. In previews; opens on March 11, Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, Manhattan; $36.25 to $96.26. Mr. Gray has been receiving numerous tributes onstage, and Steven Soderbergh is working on a documentary about his life. But ''SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL'' is the first play with his widow, Kathleen Russo, as a co-creator (Lucy Sexton was the other creator). It is a collection of his most famous and obscure writings. The cast includes Frank Wood and Hazelle Goodman. Previews start Tuesday; opens March 6, Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village; $35 and $65. Julian Sheppard's last play, ''Buicks,'' about a deluded car salesman on the run, opened in 2003 and was one of the fresher new comedies in years, so it's not surprising that it was optioned by Paramount Pictures as a sitcom for CBS. Meanwhile Mr. Sheppard brings us ''LOS ANGELES,'' about a young woman struggling in the city of angels. Katherine Waterston stars, and Adam Rapp directs. In previews, opens March 3, Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org; $20."

Even so, the survey suggests that Madison Avenue is still struggling to adjust to profound new challenges, which range from adjusting to the rapid rise of new media to the difficulty of recruiting talented employees.

Matt Leinart of the Arizona Cardinals and Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers each threw for more than 300 yards against them, mainly because their teams could not run on the league's top-ranked rushing defense. Jets Coach Eric Mangini said he would not abandon the running game. ''I think you have to be able to incorporate both,'' he said. ''During the course of the game, sometimes you throw more, sometimes you run more. Sometimes it's about the flow of the game.'' For the Jets, it always comes down to Chad Pennington, above.

The companies said remaining terms of the agreement, including additional payments to settle a lawsuit against Mr. Stern, are confidential.

The accolade honors architectural design that has stood the test of time for 25 years. ''The memorial speaks to the power of design and resonates with all of us,'' said Richard Logan, the chairman of the association's 2007 Architecture Jury. ''It creates a magical moment of the living and the dead touching, and it is still as potent as the first time you saw it.'' The two-acre memorial on the National Mall was dedicated on Nov. 13, 1982, after having been chosen from among 1,421 entries in a public design competition held by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. Its principal feature is its highly reflective black-granite V-shaped Memorial Wall, inscribed with the names of more than 58,000 men and woman who died or were classified as missing in action.

The plaintiffs argue that Wolfgang's Vault (wolfgangsvault.com), which bought the Graham collection, is illegally offering the recordings to stimulate sales of other merchandise, including T-shirts, photographs and memorabilia. Its representatives were not immediately available for comment. Joan Baez, Booker T. & the MG's, Maria Callas, Ornette Coleman, the Doors, the Grateful Dead and Bob Wills have been chosen to receive the Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Awards.

After Two Centuries, A Goya Goes Public A Goya portrait never displayed in public is to be exhibited in the spring in Saragossa, Spain, after minor restoration at the Prado in Madrid, Agence France-Presse reported. ''Portrait of Luis María de Borbón y Vallabriga,'' right, depicting the cherubic 6-year-old nephew of King Charles III, was painted in 1783, when Goya was 37. The boy grew up to become a cardinal at the age of 23 and put an end to the Spanish Inquisition. The painting was recently acquired by authorities in Aragon, in northeastern Spain, for $13 million, from a branch of the royal family that has had it for 223 years. ''It is one of the masterpieces of the period,'' Gabriele Finaldi, in charge of conservation at the Prado, told The Guardian of London. ''There is a certain amount of superficial dirt. Otherwise it is in an almost virgin state.'' It is to go on view in the spring at the provincial museum in Saragossa, near Goya's birthplace, Fuendetodos. Going Back to the Village AMC is going to ask again: What is the explanation for the mysterious Village? In a new venture into old television territory, the cable channel AMC plans to remake the Kafkaesque thriller ''The Prisoner,'' which starred Patrick McGoohan, its creator, producer and sometime writer, when it was broadcast by CBS in the late 1960s, Reuters reported. The story follows a man who finds himself trapped in ''the Village'' with no memory of how he arrived. Under constant surveillance, the man, known as Number Six, sets out to learn what is going on, why he is there and how he can escape. The premiere is scheduled for January 2008. Rob Sorcher, AMC's executive vice president for programming and production, said the channel had also acquired the rights to the original ''Prisoner'' and planned to broadcast those episodes around the time the new series begins. TBS has ordered nine more episodes of its critically acclaimed series ''My Boys,'' starring Jordana Spiro as a sportswriter who is one of the guys. TBS announced that the episodes would be broadcast in the summer."

The list included Campbell Soup, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Home Depot, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and United Parcel Service.

This week's prime example, ''A PERFECT DAY'' (Monday, 8 p.m., TNT), stars ROB LOWE as an author who gets all carried away with himself when his first novel is a megasuccess. PAGET BREWSTER (she was Hank Azaria's wife on ''Huff'') plays his flawlessly supportive, long-suffering wife. FRANCES CONROY (from ''Six Feet Under'') is the flawlessly supportive agent whom most writers would kill to have. Needless to say, the denouement takes place in a churchyard as a light snow falls. Over on CBS, the focus is on real-life happy endings. On the eighth annual special ''A HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS'' (Friday at 8 p.m.), this one with Rod Stewart's name appended to the title as host, a batch of celebrities (among them VIRGINIA MADSEN and CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER) talk about the joys of foster care and adoption. Real families make appearances to share their happy situations. Mr. Stewart, JOHN LEGEND, KATHARINE McPHEE and other musicians perform. ''IDENTITY,'' NBC's new prime-time game show, could be much worse. At least when contestants face a dozen total strangers on this series, they're trying to guess more than how much money is in their briefcases. They're trying to match the 12 people with 12 traits (occupation, I.Q., sleeping habits, net worth and the like), and each right answer is one step closer to the $500,000 grand prize. Contestants will be called on to use perception and judgment. What a concept -- and shades of ''To Tell the Truth,'' back in the golden age of game shows! The network is showing ''Identity'' five nights in a row, beginning on Monday at 9. The celebrity host is PENN JILLETTE of the comedy-magic team Penn and Teller.

Later Tom Oliphant, Washington author and former op-ed columnist for The Boston Globe, will check in for some political talk. Given that Mr. Imus spent part of last week describing the student athletes at Rutgers as ''nappy-headed ho's,'' you might think he'd have trouble booking anyone, let alone A-list establishment names.

Davidson was able to parlay the Jets' interest into a new title with the Browns, assistant head coach, even though he continued to work with the offensive line. He was promoted to offensive coordinator last week after Maurice Carthon was forced to step down. Since this is Davidson's first game as the architect of the offense, the Jets have no idea what to expect. CENTER NICK MANGOLD vs. NOSE TACKLE TED WASHINGTON Mangold, a 300-pound rookie, will give up some 60 pounds and 15 years of N.F.L. experience to Washington, below, a very effective run stopper. Washington has not recorded a sack in the past one-plus seasons, but he has 24 tackles in six games. ''It's going to be a long 60 minutes,'' said Mangold, who has incurred only one 5-yard penalty.

It will henceforth be known as ''World News With Charles Gibson,'' as opposed to ''World News Tonight,'' the program's name since July 1978, when it made its debut with Frank Reynolds, Peter Jennings and Max Robinson sharing anchor duties. Mr. Gibson, right, who was named the program's sole anchor in May after the brief pairing of Elizabeth Vargas and Bob Woodruff, was covering the Middle East conflict from Cyprus yesterday but took a break to appear, via satellite, at a gathering in Pasadena, Calif., of critics and reporters who cover television. Mr. Gibson said he was looking forward to pitting his broadcast against those of Brian Williams of NBC and Katie Couric of CBS this fall. He also acknowledged that for all the traveling he had done as a reporter and anchor over the years, he had a moment of forgetfulness yesterday: after leaving Israel for Cyprus, he realized that he had left his passport behind. ''I suspect Peter never did that -- forget his passport,'' Mr. Gibson said. JACQUES STEINBERG"

The dance-off between Emmitt Smith and Mario Lopez, right, put ABC on top for the night even as the network's ratings dropped off considerably at 9:30 for the debut of ''Show Me the Money.'' That new game show, with William Shatner as host, averaged 12.5 million viewers from 9:30 to 11, losing more than 6 million viewers from its first half-hour to its last. Meanwhile, ''3 Lbs,'' CBS's new medical drama about two neurosurgeons, played by Stanley Tucci and Mark Feuerstein, had its premiere at 10 in third place, with 9.8 million viewers. Neither new series could knock NBC's ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' from its perch as the No. 1 show at 10 (14.7 million). Fox ranked second for the night among adults 18 to 49, although fourth in total viewers, aided by ''House'' at 9 (14.6 million). BENJAMIN TOFF"

The Patriots sacked Chad Pennington four times when the teams met in Week 2, with nose tackle Vince Wilfork collecting one sack and defensive end Richard Seymour receiving credit for one and a half. In the Patriots' loss last week to the Indianapolis Colts, outside linebacker Rosevelt Colvin was in Peyton Manning's face all game. He was credited with seven pressures. JETS' RUSHING DEFENSE vs. COREY DILLON and LAURENCE MARONEY Corey Dillon had his best rushing game of the season when the teams played in Week 2, gaining 80 yards on 20 carries. He has not carried the ball more than 15 times in any of the past four games, ceding the backfield, however grudgingly, to Laurence Maroney, a rookie who rushed for 125 yards against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Jets rank 30th out of 32 teams against the run. ''It's insulting when you can't stop the run and they know they're going to run on you,'' Jets linebacker Matt Chatham said. KAREN CROUSE (NYT)"

That show, combined with ''Dateline'' at 8 p.m. (8.2 million) and a ''Law & Order'' repeat at 10 p.m. (8.27 million), boosted NBC into first place among adults 18 to 49. Fox was No. 2 in that age group, as its ''So You Think You Can Dance'' (8.63 million) dance-off helped push it past CBS in that demographic. CBS's new show ''Gameshow Marathon'' (8.37 million) made its debut at 8 p.m. and was followed by reruns of ''Criminal Minds'' (9.95 million) and ''CSI: New York'' (9.76 million).

Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. Broadway 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). (On Jan. 17, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.) Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). (On Tuesday, Eileen Atkins will assume Ms. Jones's role, and Ron Eldard Mr. O'Byrne's.) Walter Kerr Theater; 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger) * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM' The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'THE OTHER SIDE' In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway * 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747.

Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100.

(Zinoman) 'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Van Gelder) 'FEAR ITSELF: SECRETS OF THE WHITE HOUSE' In the latest cartoonish sendup of the Bush administration, the simple task of translating ideas into dramatic form seems to have been overlooked (1:45). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255; closing Sunday. (Zinoman) 'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) 'EL CARRO' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Pleasant but slight, this sociological farce from Colombia tells the story of a vintage convertible that changes the lives of the middle-class Velez family to mildly humorous effect. (Nathan Lee) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2' (PG, 100 minutes) In this unnecessary sequel to a mediocre remake, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his clan visit Lake Winnetka, also the regular summer dwelling of Tom's longtime archrival (Eugene Levy). A tiresome film, full of repetitive, misfired jokes, false emotions and caricatures. Even the pairing of Mr. Martin and Mr. Levy fails to inspire anything more than the occasional smile.(Laura Kern) 'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott) 'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE' (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott) 'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'INITIAL D' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Cantonese) A street-racing film based on a popular Japanese comic book, ''Initial D'' pitches swaggering Takeshi (Shawn Yue) against diffident Takumi (Jay Chou), a reluctant hero who prefers the charms of his girlfriend (Anne Suzuki) to the dangers of hairpin bends. A slick but silly affair unlikely to appeal to anyone over 15. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'THE INTRUDER' (No rating, 130 minutes, in French) The French director Claire Denis's most ambitious and poetically intuitive film explores the troubled soul of a brooding loner who undergoes a heart transplant and travels halfway around the world, from the Jura mountains to the South Seas, to begin a new life. This visually rhapsodic film is both profound and profoundly enigmatic. (Holden) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) 'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden) * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott) 'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott) 'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Lee) 'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of ''The Graduate,'' in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is. (Scott) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'THE WHITE COUNTESS' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Set in Shanghai in 1936 and starring Ralph Fiennes and three Redgraves, the final collaboration between James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (who died during post-production) wants to be a pulse-racing cross between ''Casablanca'' and 'The English Patient.'' But this fussy, pieced-together epic manqué never develops any stamina. (Holden) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series ARTIST'S CHOICE: STEPHEN SONDHEIM (Through Sunday) The Museum of Modern Art's 15-film series of works chosen by Mr. Sondheim, the legendary Broadway composer and lyricist, concludes this weekend with a selection of period films. They include Truffaut's ''Story of Adele H.'' (1975); Stanley Kubrick's gorgeous romantic drama ''Barry Lyndon'' (1975); Louis Malle's sexy comic drama ''Le Voleur'' (1967); and ''I Compagni'' (1963), Mario Monicelli's drama, starring Marcello Mastroianni, about a textile factory strike.

They are Jerry Blumenthal and Gordon Quinn's ''Golub: Late Works Are the Catastrophes'' (2004), a follow-up to their first film on the artist Leon Golub, and Radu Mihaileanu's ''Live and Become'' (2005), a drama about a young boy in a Sudanese refugee camp who takes on a Jewish identity. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AKIM FUNK BUDDHA AND THE EBONYASIA PROJECT (Sunday) The American-born, Zimbabwe-raised Akim Ndlovu, who performs as Akim Funk Buddha, creates theatrical mash-ups involving dance, poetry, music and storytelling. Here he offers a program exploring Asian music and movement styles. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, at Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934. No cover. (Laura Sinagra) ANTHRAX (Tomorrow) The amiable speed punk-metal band Anthrax had a tough time defending its name during the country's post-9/11 bout with actual anthrax. After a decade and a half of quitting and reconciliations, the original band is back in support of a greatest-hits collection. God Forbid opens. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com; $25. (Sinagra) AUTORICKSHAW (Thursday) This Canadian quartet, consisting of the vocalist-pianist Suba Sankaran, the tabla player Ed Hanley, the bassist Rich Brown and the percussionist Debashis Sinha, mixes South Indian traditional sounds and Bollywood-flavored pieces with funk and jazz. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15. (Sinagra) CHRIS BROWN (Tonight) Riding rough beats with a still discernable childlike sweetness on the single ''Run It,'' the frisky teenage R & B singer Chris Brown snags both the adult hip-hop crowd and younger fans who liked Usher's ''Yeah,'' despite not being quite sure what the lyrics were about. 8, Bergen Performing Arts Center, 30 North Van Brunt Street, Englewood, N.J., (201) 816-8160; $35 to $45. (Sinagra) CORDERO (Tuesday) Mixing the open atmospherics of the Southwest with the gritty feel of the Brooklyn art scene, the bilingual Ani Cordero (who has worked with Calexico and Giant Sand) and her band make guitar rock that gives urban brashness some borderland mystery. 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $8. (Sinagra) THE BUSH TETRAS, MATT SWEENEY (Monday) The Bush Tetras are no-wave luminaries whose funky punk made them downtown stars in 1980, and who are now enjoying New York's return to the sound they helped invent. The local guitarist Matt Sweeney has been in the subcultural spotlight lately because of his Superwolf collaboration with Will Oldham. 9 p.m., Lit Lounge, 93 Second Avenue, near East Fifth Street, East Village, (212) 777-7987; no cover. (Sinagra) DAMON & NAOMI, WINGDALE COMMUNITY SINGERS (Tonight) After the bumpy breakup of the less-is-more indie-rock trio Galaxie 500, the drummer Damon Krukowski and the bassist Naomi Yang morphed into a ghostly dream-rock duo. They play tonight with the intimate, improvisatory horn players Bhob Rainey and Greg Kelley. In the Wingdale Community Singers, the atmospheric guitarist David Grubbs, the vocalist Hannah Marcus and the novelist Rick Moody get together and make literate Brooklynite folk. 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, at Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; $10. (Sinagra) DION (Monday) Dion DiMucci sang ''The Wanderer'' just as his wildest ups and downs were getting under way. His journey through the 70's and beyond involved folk-rock redirection, returns to doo-wop form, drugs, recovery and bouts of Christianity. Here he plays acoustic versions of songs by the likes of Robert Johnson, Willie Dixon and Hank Williams. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $35 (sold out).

(Sinagra) THE DOUBLE, CELEBRATION, KYP MALONE (Tomorrow) The kaleidoscopic Double uses all the tools at its lo-fi disposal in service of arty pop undercut with burbles, dark surges and twinges. Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. Kyp Malone is a vocalist and guitarist in the spacey TV on the Radio. For years a fixture on San Francisco's underground art scene, he's been doing his own thing lately. 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $12.(Sinagra) GREG GARING (Tonight) Greg Garing once mixed country with electronica, but he's moved steadily toward country's roots, holding on to old-fashioned, heart-on-sleeve honky-tonk. 9, Sin-é, 150 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077; $10. (Jon Pareles) REBECCA GATES (Tuesday) As the lead singer and guitarist for the spare 90's duo the Spinanes, from Portland, Ore., Rebecca Gates wrote thoughtful but driving songs made more intimate by her low, breathy vocals. Lately she's been trying out new solo material. 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $9. (Sinagra) BEN GIBBARD (Tuesday) The wistful, sad-voiced Death Cab for Cutie frontman (and the voice of the electronic offshoot Postal Service) will perform solo. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 (sold out). (Sinagra) IMOGEN HEAP (Wednesday) Taking overproduced sheen to the far reaches of existential loneliness, Imogen Heap's single ''Hide and Seek'' sounds like the work of an a cappella boy band after facing off with the malevolent computer from ''2001: A Space Odyssey.'' She ventures into shoe-gazey pop, too. Zoe Keating also plays. 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra) IOs (Tomorrow) Just like the Canadian band Stars, the iOs remind you of that exuberant 90's moment when bands like Mavis Piggott and Madder Rose made it seem that smart girl voices over big guitars were the way of the future. The iOs have a guy singer, too. But as in Stars, the female voice is the more affecting. The Primms, the Sugarbeats and Jennifer O'Connor also play. 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sinagra) IVY (Tonight) This dreamy pop trio -- the guitarist and producer Andy Chase, Andy Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne and the sultry French singer-next-door Dominique Durand -- specializes in shimmery upbeat songs about evanescent love and wintery ennui. Matt Costa opens. 10, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $16 in advance, $18 at the door.

(Sinagra) MORNINGWOOD, THE EXIT (Wednesday) Morningwood is a local band that plays muscularly melodic rock with a hint of 80's bar-pop panache. The band's singer, Chantal Claret, is often compared to the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde. The Exit, a guitar trio, makes melodic punk. Army of Me also plays. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111;, $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) MUSETTE EXPLOSION (Tomorrow) Taking as inspiration the French accordion music of the 30's and 40's as well as Django Reinhardt-style jazz, Musette Explosion plays a kind of Gypsy hybrid that's different from the music of the currently proliferating Gypsy-punk scene. 6 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000; free. (Sinagra) LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Sunday) Led by the singers Allyssa Lamb and Emily Hurst, this band mixes musicians from the United States, France and Colombia who mine their Latin heritage in the performance of boleros, cha-chas, cumbias, huaynos and cowboy songs. 10 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500; no cover.

(Sinagra) SA-RA (Wednesday) This hip-hop production group, made up of Om'Mas Keith, Taz Arnold and Shafiq Husayn, has produced songs for Common, Bilal and Erykah Badu, among others. It has its own soul-based songs as well, some of which will be released by Kanye West's label next year. 10 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212) 941-8100; $10. (Sinagra) SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY & THE ASBURY JUKES (Tonight and tomorrow night) While his friend Bruce Springsteen left the Jersey Shore behind and went on to write all-American anthems and parables, Southside Johnny Lyon stuck to the old bar-band basics: rolling R & B vamps and raspy-voiced, good-natured soul plaints, complete with horn section. 8, B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Sinagra) TEDDY THOMPSON (Wednesday) A British folk-rock scion, Teddy Thompson looks to distinguish himself from his parents, Richard and Linda, while still honoring their legacy. His baritone voice sounds like his father's without the bite, not always a bad thing. 9 p.m., the Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; no cover (suggested $5 donation). (Sinagra) LA TROUPE MAKANDAL (Tomorrow) La Troupe Makandal continues to bring the spiritually directed drumming, dancing and chanting voodoo rituals of Haiti to the larger public. Here, in a program called ''Carnival Dawn,'' the group concentrates on the rites of winter, particularly the koupe gato, a celebration of the festival of the Three Kings. 8 p.m., the Great Room at South Oxford Space, 138 South Oxford Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 953-6638; $15; students with ID and ages 65+, $10; children under 12, $5. (Sinagra) WE ARE SCIENTISTS, OXFORD COLLAPSE (Thursday) The pointy guitars and firecracker drums of this local band propel the tremulous pleas of Keith Murray into a full-on lust panic. Where similar bands like Hot Hot Heat can sound too studied, We Are Scientists makes its precise parts seem inspired. The trio Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls acerbic forebears like the Embarrassment. Bishop Allen and the Kites also play. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 (sold out). (Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

(Chinen) MICHAEL BISIO (Tonight) The physicality of Mr. Bisio's bass playing puts him in touch with numerous predecessors in the avant-garde, but his expressive touch is distinctive; he plays an early set with a quartet featuring the saxophonist Avram Fefer, and a later set in trio with the pianist Matthew Shipp and the drummer Jay Rosen. 8 and 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) BUSHWACKED (Wednesday) The title of this avant-garde oratorio by the saxophonist Mark Whitecage provides a good indication of its political bent and degree of subtlety; the piece's New York premiere will feature Roy Campbell Jr. on trumpet and vocals, Rozanne Levine on clarinet, Joe Fonda on bass and Jay Rosen on drums. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET (Tuesday) As on the excellent recent album ''In Flux'' (Savoy), Mr. Coltrane places his tenor and soprano saxophones against the cohesive stirrings of a working band: the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer E. J. Strickland. 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $15, $12 in advance.

(Chinen) PETER EPSTEIN/BRAD SHEPIK/MATT KILMER (Tuesday) As on the album ''Lingua Franca'' (Songlines), this trio blends world folk influences with jazz improvisation; Mr. Epstein's alto saxophone, Mr. Shepik's guitar and Mr. Kilmer's percussion each play an equal role in the collective. A preceding set, at 10 p.m., will feature Crunch, a band composed of Mr. Epstein, the bassist J. Anthony Granelli and the slide guitarist David Tronzo. 11 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, between Houston and Bleecker Streets, East Village, (212) 614-0505; cover, $8. (Chinen) THE MUSIC OF TOMMY FLANAGAN AND MILT JACKSON (Tuesday through Jan. 15) Tommy Flanagan and Milt Jackson were, respectively, a grippingly erudite pianist and a sophisticatedly bluesy vibraphonist; this tribute features the worthy inheritors Renee Rosnes and Steve Nelson on piano and vibes, and the sterling rhythm team of Peter Washington and Lewis Nash on bass and drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.(Chinen) THE FOUR BAGS (Sunday) The instrumental palette of this collaborative quartet -- trombone, accordion, guitar and reeds -- creates the impression of a contemporary chamber jazz; so does the repertory, which includes arrangements of Chopin and Brian Wilson, along with thoughtful original compositions. 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) CURTIS FULLER AND LOUIS HAYES (Thursday) Mr. Fuller, the trombonist, and Mr. Hayes, the drummer, were both prominent participants in the golden era of hard-bop; here they enlist Mulgrew Miller on piano and Robert Hurst on bass, and spotlight a couple of young trumpeters on the rise, Maurice Brown and Sean Jones. 11:30 p.m. and 1 a.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) CHICO HAMILTON AND FRIENDS (Thursday) Since the 1940's, Mr. Hamilton has practiced a perceptive and colorful approach to jazz percussion; he performs here with a number of younger colleagues. 8 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000; cover, $15. (Chinen) JOHN HEBERT QUARTET (Tonight) Mr. Hebert, a bassist with experimental tendencies and compositional ambitions, leads a versatile group with the guitarist John Abercrombie, the tenor saxophonist Adam Kolker and the drummer Bob Meyer. 10 p.m., Detour, 349 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 533-6212; cover, $10, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) JOHN HOLLENBECK'S CLAUDIA QUINTET (Thursday) This improvising chamber ensemble pursues texturally oriented and often contrapuntal exploration; Mr. Hollenbeck's drumming is one color on a palette that also includes Chris Speed's clarinet and tenor saxophone, Ted Reichman's accordion and Matt Moran's vibraphone. They share their billing with Jazz Big Band Graz, an accomplished group from Austria. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10 and one-drink minimum. (Chinen) INDO-PAK (Thursday) The alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa leads this new trio, which fuses Indian music with jazz improvisation; his partners are Rez Abbasi on guitar and Dan Weiss on tabla. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) MAT MANERI GROUP (Thursday) On the recent album ''Pentagon'' (Thirsty Ear), the violinist and violist Mat Maneri plugged into electric fusion without forsaking the tenor and thrust of free-jazz; he reprises those explorations in a group featuring his father, Joe Maneri, on reeds, along with Jacob Sacks on piano, John Hebert on bass and Gerald Cleaver and John McLellan on drums. 8 and 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $10 per set. (Chinen) ANDY MILNE AND DAPP THEORY (Sunday and Wednesday) With Dapp Theory, the keyboardist Andy Milne fashions a contemporary fusion explicitly indebted to hip-hop; his band includes Loren Stillman on saxophones, Janek Gwizdala on bass, Sean Rickman on drums and John Moon on percussion and spoken word. Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $10, with a $10 minimum; no cover for students with ID.

(Chinen) BOB MINTZER BIG BAND (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Mintzer, a saxophonist and decade-long member of the Yellowjackets, has led this 16-piece outfit for roughly the same span; it's a brightly brassy ensemble with a modernistic sheen. 8 and 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) BEN MONDER TRIO (Tuesday) In the hands of Mr. Monder, the electric guitar is a coloristic instrument first and foremost; his fine recent album, ''Oceana'' (Sunnyside), showcases both his dizzyingly proficient solo puzzles and his coolly convoluted pieces for trio. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) JAMES MOODY QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Like his mentor, Dizzy Gillespie, the alto saxophonist James Moody is a stalwart bebopper and one of jazz's most ebullient entertainers; he leads a solid group consisting of the pianist Renee Rosnes, the bassist Todd Coolman and the drummer Adam Nussbaum. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) A TRIBUTE TO DANNY MOORE (Tonight and tomorrow) The trumpeter Danny Moore, who died last February, was the quintessential musician's musician. Fittingly, this tribute features players with similar reputations: the tenor saxophonist George Coleman, the pianist Anthony Wonsey, the drummer Joe Farnsworth and the bassist John Webber. 9 and 11 p.m., and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) JOE MORRIS TRIO WITH KEN VANDERMARK (Tuesday) Mr. Morris is a guitarist who applies the clear tone of Jim Hall to darker and pricklier purposes; he performs here with another uncompromising explorer, the multireedist Ken Vandermark, and a frequent collaborator, the drummer Luther Gray. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen) * NYC JAZZ ALTERNATIVES: THE NEW GENERATION (Wednesday) This one-night mini-festival rounds up half a dozen groups from the margins of jazz culture: Gutbucket, a raucous jam band; Rashanim, an avant-garde klezmer group; Okkyung Lee, an adventurous cellist; a pair of trios led by the pianist Benny Lackner and the trombonist Jacob Garchik; and a plugged-in sextet led by the trumpeter Shane Endsley. It won't be a survey of jazz's new generation so much as a series of snapshots, intriguing and inconclusive. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $12. (Chinen) GRETCHEN PARLATO (Tonight and Monday) The lilting cadence and mellow sonority of Ms. Parlato's voice have earned her a good many casual admirers; a recent deluge of critical acclaim has more to do with her musicianship, underscored here by a deep rapport with the guitarist Lionel Loueke. Tonight at 6,, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; no cover. Monday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $15. (Chinen) JEREMY PELT QUARTET (Thursday) The clarion tone and preternatural poise of Mr. Pelt's trumpet playing have earmarked him as a rising star in the jazz mainstream; as on his recent album ''Identity'' (MaxJazz), he plays here with the pianist Frank LoCrasto, the bassist Vicente Archer and the drummer Eric McPherson. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) RE: ARRANGED: THE MUSIC OF JACO PASTORIUS, GIL EVANS, LENNON & McCARTNEY (Tuesday through Jan. 15) The sweep of this project, which clearly runs the risk of incoherence, could be a perfect challenge for the pianist and accordionist Gil Goldstein, one of the most resourceful arrangers in jazz today. Just as promising is the lineup, featuring the trumpeter Randy Brecker, the saxophonist Chris Potter, the vibraphonist Mike Mainieri, the bassist Richard Bona, the percussionist Don Alias and an improvising string trio led by the violinist Joyce Hammann. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) * KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Tuesday through Jan. 15) Mr. Rosenwinkel is almost certainly the most widely hailed jazz guitarist under 40, especially among musicians; his deeply sympathetic rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner provides the focal point of this shadowy and slippery ensemble, which also includes Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Eric Harland on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) LOREN STILLMAN QUARTET (Wednesday) With his recent album, ''It Could Be Anything'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), Mr. Stillman reinforces his reputation as an alto saxophonist with an inquisitive relationship to jazz tradition; he performs here with Jacob Sacks on piano, Scott Lee on bass and Jeff Hirschfield on drums. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) STEVE WILSON QUARTET WITH NICHOLAS PAYTON (Through Sunday) An alto saxophonist with a dry tone but a rounded sense of phrase, Mr. Wilson recruits a well-established rhythm section -- Bruce Barth on piano, Ed Howard on bass and Adam Cruz on drums -- and locks horns with Mr. Payton, one of the outstanding trumpeters of our time. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20 and $25. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow) The good news of the Met's revival of its 1991 production of Donizetti's ''Elixir of Love'' is the entrancing performance of Ruth Ann Swenson as Adina. Some opera buffs have long found Ms. Swenson's work vocally exquisite but temperamentally bland. Here she brings a breezy comic grace to the role of a wealthy young landowner in an Italian village who thinks herself immune to sentimental notions about love, until the painfully shy peasant Nemorino gets through to her. Ms. Swenson sings with her trademark creamy sound, effortful richness and impressive agility. The tenor Ramón Vargas is an ardent and endearing Nemorino. Maurizio Barbacini conducts. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $220. (Anthony Tommasini) 'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tomorrow) Most stagings of Strauss's ever-popular operetta, including some revivals of the Met's 1986 Otto Schenk production, seem uncomfortable with the mix of silliness and cynicism in the story of playful infidelities in 1870's Vienna. But the Metropolitan Opera's current presentation boasts a winning cast of singers who, for the most part, take the story seriously and give subtle portrayals, especially Bo Skovhus as the ladies' man Eisenstein, Sondra Radvanovsky as his knowing wife, Marlis Petersen as the perky chambermaid and Earle Patriarco as the wily Dr. Falke. Jacques Lacombe conducts a lithe and fresh performance. And with the comedic actor Bill Irwin as the drunken jailor Frosch, the show has plenty of hilarity. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $220. (Tommasini) 'H.M.S. PINAFORE,' 'THE MIKADO' (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players are a small city institution in their own right, dedicated to presenting polished light-opera performances. Two of the most popular are this winter's fare, as well as a concert of other highlights on Thursday night. ''Pinafore,'' tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 2 p.m.; ''Mikado,'' tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., and Tuesday at 7 p.m.; ''Quintessential G&S'' concert, Thursday at 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212; $40 to $86. (Anne Midgette) 'WOZZECK' (Tonight) Alban Berg's bleak atonal opera may not strike many people as quite the thing to usher in the New Year. But James Levine is a masterly interpreter of this musically stunning and dramatically compelling work, which he keeps bringing back to the Met in a noble effort to make ''Wozzeck'' essential to the company's repertory. With Mark Lamos's arrestingly abstract 1997 production and an inspired cast led by Alan Held in the title role, this revival should be seen by all serious opera fans. Mr. Levine elicits a searingly beautiful performance from the great Met orchestra. 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $36 to $205. (Tommasini) Classical Music AVALON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) This young quartet offers the first of its two ''Romantic Frontiers'' concerts (the second is on Jan. 14). The program is Beethoven's Quartet in F (Op. 59, No.1) and Schoenberg's Quartet No. 1. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Allan Kozinn) JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) In the spirit of its idiosyncratic founder, Jens Nygaard, this feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and familiar works. The ensemble and its guests -- including Mikhail Kopelman, the former first violinist of the Borodin String Quartet, and his daughter, Elizaveta Kopelman, a pianist -- perform Grieg's Movement in C minor, Elgar's ''Harmony Music 5'' and a Rimsky-Korsakov piano trio. 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259; $10 to $25. (Kozinn) MET ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Three realms of the soprano Renée Fleming's repertory are explored in this concert by the Met Orchestra, with James Levine conducting. She sings the ''Letter Scene'' from Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' the closing scene from Strauss's ''Capriccio'' and, of special interest, the harmonically murky and expressionistic ''Altenberg Lieder'' of Alban Berg. Mr. Levine also offers performances of Tchaikovsky's ''Romeo and Juliet'' fantasy overture and Wagner's Overture and Bacchanale from ''Tannhäuser.'' 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $46 to $155. (Tommasini) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) The young Canadian violinist James Ehnes joins Lorin Maazel and the New York Philharmonic to play Walton's sumptuous and too rarely heard Violin Concerto at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and at Avery Fisher Hall. On Thursday, the superb English conductor Jonathan Nott takes over, leading a program that includes Strauss's ''Alpine Symphony'' and John Corigliano's ''Red Violin,'' a 2003 concerto based on themes from Mr. Corigliano's score for the film ''The Red Violin.'' Joshua Bell, for whom the piece was composed, is the soloist. Tonight at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; $27 to $92. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $99. (Kozinn) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC ENSEMBLES (Sunday) Members of the Philharmonic have one of their periodic chamber-music gatherings in an offbeat program of Bridge, Prokofiev, Enescu, Diamond and Françaix. 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $29. (Bernard Holland) RICHARD TUCKER FOUNDATION GALA (Wednesday) Perhaps responding to the increase of cancellations by big-name singers in past seasons, the annual Tucker gala has downsized this year, moving from Avery Fisher Hall to Alice Tully Hall and focusing less on superstars than on rising young talents. Not that they're unknown quantities: most, like Laquita Mitchell, Jennifer Aylmer, Carolyn Betty and Jordan Bisch, have active performing schedules. The master of ceremonies is Denyce Graves, while the tenor Matthew Polenzani makes a belated appearance to compensate for the fact that he couldn't attend the gala in 2004, the year he won the foundation award. 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $75 and $100.

Museums ASIA SOCIETY: 'VIETNAM: DESTINATION FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM -- THE ART OF DINH Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age and the global consumerist economy. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'EDWARD BURTYNSKY: MANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson) CHELSEA ART MUSEUM: 'THE BODY IMAGE IN CRISTÓBAL GABARRÓN'S ART, 1963-2005,' through Jan. 14. A member of the mid-20th-century European Informal art movement based on mentally improvised rather than formal motifs, this Spanish artist is concerned with the body, but not in its traditional manifestations. His abstractions and semiabstractions give it a morphing, metaphysical presence; sometimes they involve the depiction of actual body parts, but they rely more on textures, colors and vague forms to evoke the body's ever-shifting sense of itself. But for all the blustery vigor on display, the work gives the viewer a powerful sense of been-there-seen-that. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719.(Grace Glueck) * COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Roberta Smith) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AFRICAN-AMERICAN VERNACULAR PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Feb. 26. These days, collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in an exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Johnson) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer who incorporates into his work artifacts he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Glueck) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith) MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. (See above.) (Glueck) * MET: ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: 'COMBINES,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: BEYOND THE VISIBLE: 'THE ART OF ODILON REDON,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neoconceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Holland Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. (See above.) (Smith) EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what Latino art means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter) NEUE GALERIE: 'EGON SCHIELE: THE RONALD S. LAUDER AND SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTIONS,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART : 'WHAT IS IT? HIMALAYAN ART,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter) * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown CHARLES BIEDERMAN: 'WORKS FROM THE 30'S' One of the most interestingly maverick and talented of between-the-wars American Modernists, Biederman left New York in 1942 for Minnesota, where he continued to make art and write art theory until his death in 2004. This small exhibition of biomorphic abstract paintings and one glossy construction of squares and knobs from the 1930's shows what an excellent student of European Surrealism and Constructivism he was. Meredith Ward, 60 East 66th Street, (212) 744-7306, through Jan. 14. (Johnson) OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored, Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of American Modernists who were active between World Wars I and II. This substantial exhibition of works on paper extends the full-scale Bluemner retrospective now at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman) Galleries: 57th Street * SAUL LEITER: 'EARLY COLOR' In their painterly concentration on shadows, reflections, light and color, the distinctive color photographs that the fashion photographer Saul Leiter took in New York in the 1950's reform street photography by concentrating less on pedestrians than on what they might see. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, through Jan. 21. (Smith) GERHARD RICHTER This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through Jan. 14. (Johnson) 'STRUCTURE' Hardly any artist today takes geometry as seriously as certain American Modernists did, following the lead of Mondrian in the mid-20th century. So this well-produced show of geometric relief sculptures by Ilya Bolotowsky, Nikolai Kasak and Charles Biederman, among others, comes as a nice surprise. Eli Bornstein's truly beautiful, neatly gridded constructions of floating wood blocks painted lovely confectionery colors are alone worth the trip. Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545, through Jan. 14. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea MARINA ABRAMOVIC: 'BALKAN EROTIC EPIC' This performance artist's staged video tableaus illustrating beliefs about the magical efficacy of certain sexually charged acts are interesting and amusing but less arousing than you might have hoped. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21. (Johnson) ELLEN ALTFEST: 'STILL LIVES' Painted from life in the studio and outside, these thoughtful images of plants, cactuses, logs and driftwood reflect old-fashioned painterly values but still manage a fresh intensity of surface, space, form and intention. Bellwether Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Jan. 21. (Smith) NOBUYOSHI ARAKI, 'PAINTING FLOWER AND DIARIES' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, through Jan. 14. (Johnson) * TAMY BEN-TOR, 'EXPLORATION IN THE DOMAIN OF IDIOCY' On video -- and live on Friday and Saturday afternoons -- a wonderfully talented comic performance artist creates hilariously self-absorbed characters. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, (212) 989-7700, through Jan. 14. (Johnson) DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD Ms. Butterfield continues to make horses out of weathered branches and scrap steel that are, at best, magically lifelike. In the big one lying down in the gallery, the metal seems just as alive as the illusory animal. Three horses on the Park Avenue median, however, are out of their element -- too delicate to compete with the traffic and the giant buildings, but perhaps because of that, poetically poignant. Edward Thorp, 210 Eleventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets; and on the Park Avenue median between 52nd and 54th Streets; (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) MIKI CARMI: 'PSYCHIC READYMADES' This young Israeli-born painter makes strangely creepy pictures of oversize bald heads based on those of elderly members of his family. He lavishes painterly attention on veins, age spots, baggy eyes, wrinkles and drooping lips, and he floats the heads like weird balloons against white backgrounds. The paintings are far from beautiful, but their unsettling impact feels right for the often confusing roles that elders play in our psychic lives. Stux, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-1600, through Jan. 21. (Johnson) * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith) MATTHEW MCCASLIN This inventive sculptor plays with the tension between nature and technology. A working fountain has water flowing from sunflowers made of wide showerheads and copper pipe planted in a claw-foot bathtub. And the arrangement of a cuckoo clock and a flat-screen video view of peaceful lake waters on a natural plywood wall slyly enhances the faux-rustic ambience. Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183, through Jan. 14. (Johnson) GORDON MOORE Elegantly understated paintings animated by ghostly linear figures and their shadows, which gambol before the large-paned grid of -- well, maybe a factory window. Composed of lines of different lengths and colors and various thicknesses, these antic figures seem to vibrate on and under the paintings' lightly brushed surfaces. Mr. Moore rings many intricate variations on his basic format, which, while it commits to the visible, manages to engage the mystery of what lies beyond it. Betty Cuningham Gallery, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, through Jan. 28. (Glueck) NICHOLAS NIXON: 'LIFE AND TIMES' Among other photographs from the last 30 years, this show features Mr. Nixon's famous ''Brown Sisters,'' a set of group portraits of four sisters made annually, starting in 1975. It is almost painfully touching to see the beautiful siblings evolve from teenagers to late middle age. And then you begin to wonder how long this can go on before one of the five participants will no longer be available. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Jan. 21. (Johnson) * LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith) PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson) ROBERT STONE Made with a loose, watercolorlike touch, this young British artist's oil-on-canvas paintings depict enigmatic and vaguely comical scenes, like tiny Canadian Mounties having a secret funeral in the woods, or a pair of travelers in oddly mixed costumes posing with a coffin. They are just sweet and peculiar enough to give you pause. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo MARTIN BEAUREGARD, 'SOMNAMBULIC' Old videos of absurdist performances and a new one about meditating and dreaming are eclipsed by two large stuffed-animal sculptures: a sumptuously furry teddy bear the size of a real cub made from a real bearskin, fearsome big claws and all; and a real moose head with majestic, silver-leafed antlers. Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347, through Feb. 4. (Johnson) * JIM DRAIN AND ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy, 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending on a ladder into a kind of rabbit hole. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, through Jan. 28. (Smith) SUZAN FRECON An accomplished abstract painter presents a serene installation of six large works -- three grid-based and three featuring simple, curvy shapes -- all in deep, rich reds, blues and greens. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Jan. 14. (Johnson) Other Galleries 'MONUMENTS FOR THE USA' The critic Ralph Rugoff invited more than 50 artists to submit proposals for a never-to-be-built national monument. All the proposals, mostly illustrative works on paper ranging in spirit from scathingly critical to earnestly visionary, are presented by this entertaining if not especially profound exhibition. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 924-4212, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Last Chance ABETZ/DRESCHER The Berlin-based collaborators Maike Abetz and Oliver Drescher paint large, busily detailed pictures of Renaissance ruins densely populated by fashion models, broken guitars, televisions and naked figures from pagan myth in a style you might call psychedelic pre-Raphaelite. Though not impressive formally or technically, they do capture a certain wildly eclectic and deeply narcissistic state of youthful consciousness. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-0461, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!' This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600, closing Wednesday. (Smith) * FRANCO MONDINI-RUIZ: QUATTROCENTO In a bit of performative art-making that sends up art-world preciousness with intimations of tourist souvenirs, the 400 paintings here are seductive, portable, priced to sell ($400) and sometimes made on the spot. Also good, at Envoy, a gallery that shares the Taylor space, is the New York debut of Nils Erik Gjerdevik, a young Norwegian artist who cannibalizes snippets from Art Nouveau to graffiti into playfully calligraphic designs. Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (646) 230-0992; Envoy, (212) 242-7524; both closing tomorrow. (Smith) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ELIZABETH MURRAY' Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) Closing Monday. (Kimmelman) * THE MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'LASTING FOUNDATIONS: THE ART OF ARCHITECTURE IN AFRICA' Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya. World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700, closing today. (Cotter) ANNYSA NG: 'LOVE & FEAR' A beautiful new gallery occupying two floors of a tiny brick house presents works of postmodernist faux-antiquity by a Chinese artist who has studied in Hong Kong, New York and Germany. The large, Victorian-style silhouettes are not without possibilities, though perhaps they are too Kara Walker-like; the hanging assemblages made of braided hair, fabric and found objects have an erotically stirring poetic delicacy. Holasek Weir, 502 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 367-9093, closing Tuesday. (Johnson) RICHARD POUSETTE-DART: 'PRESENCES: THE IMPLODING OF COLOR' Though routinely associated with Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart had metaphysical and symbolist interests that distinguished him from better-known members of that group. In the 1960's and 70's, he turned to what you could call Pointillist Color Field Painting, and though the sensuous impact of light, color and thickly stippled paint is strongly asserted, the works are also animated by intimations of cosmic mysticism. Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) 'RUSSIA 2: BAD NEWS FROM RUSSIA' An entertaining, congested and abrasive exhibition presents stridently and antically political contemporary works by 15 individuals and groups who live and work in Russia. White Box, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 714-2347; and the Annex, 601 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (646) 638-3785; closing Wednesday. (Johnson) FELIX SCHRAMM: 'COMBER' It looks as if a tornado ripped parts off an ordinary house and slammed them into the gallery, creating a Cubist-Expressionist-style environment that was, in fact, carefully designed and assembled by this young and innovative German sculptor. Grimm/Rosenfeld, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-2388, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)"

The first son of Ogwu Okoronkwo Chukueke and Ada Oji Ihudiya Okoronkwo, Kanu Okoronkwo was born in Uzuakoli, Abia State in Igboland, Nigeria. He grew up in Uzuakoli and attended the prestigious secondary school Methodist College, from which he graduated in the late1940's. It was at Methodist College that he cultivated his life-long love of science, classical music and the visual arts. It was also there that his pioneering spirit was nurtured, a spirit that would lead him to the United States after graduation. Kanu Okoronkwo graduated from Syracuse University in 1953 with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering. After graduation, he received further technical training at RCA, and thereafter was employed by CBS television in New York City. During his time in New York, he met and courted Sylvia Johnson, to whom he was married in 1959. Following Nigeria's independence from Great Britain in 1960, he returned to Nigeria with his wife, and became the first Nigerian appointed as general manager of telecommunications for Eastern Nigeria. During this period his three children, Chinyere, Kanu, and Ifeoma were born. Following the Biafran War, he returned to New York, and became a director of network planning at New York Telephone Company, from which he retired in 1992 after nearly twentyfive years of service. Kanu Okoronkwo is survived by Mrs. Sylvia Okoronkwo; children Chinyere Okoronkwo, Esq., Kanu David Okoronkwo, Esq., Ifeoma O. Aitkenhead, MD.; grandchildren Anastasia Williams, Katherine Uche Aitkenhead, Sophie Oluchi Aitkenhead, Lauren Ezinne Aitkenhead, Daniel Okezie Chukueke Okoronkwo; four brothers Obiefula Okoronkwo, Eze Okoronkwo, Chibuisi Okoronkwo, Mark Okoronkwo; eight sisters Ezenwanyi Idima, Ugboaku Fordjur, Helen Okoronkwo, Nnennaya Ogbonnaya, Nmanma Madukwe, Nnennaya Igbokwe, Chinwemma Okoronkwo, Uzunma Jiala; and numerous nieces, nephews, cousins (with a sibling like relationship) and a host of friends. Mr. Okoronkwo was 79 years of age. Funeral Service will be held at Frank E. Campbell The Funeral Chapel 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street Friday, January 26, 2007 at 1:30 pm."

''I wanted to give this opportunity to girls who had a light so bright that not even poverty could dim that light,'' Ms. Winfrey said at a news conference attended by Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, and the entertainment celebrities Tina Turner, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, Sidney Poitier, Chris Tucker and Spike Lee. Ms. Winfrey said she hoped the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, above, in Henley-on-Klip, south of Johannesburg, could help ''change the face of a nation.'' She added, ''Girls who are educated are less likely to get H.I.V./AIDS, and in this country, which has such a pandemic, we have to begin to change the pandemic.'' Many of the girls come from afflicted families. Ms. Winfrey said that from 3,500 applicants, the academy, with a 28-building campus, accepted 152 girls ages 11 and 12. Eventually it will accommodate 450 and a broader age range. Ms. Winfrey said she planned a second school, for boys and girls, in the KwaZulu-Natal province. Father Seeks News Of Boy From Madonna The father of the motherless Malawian boy whom Madonna seeks to adopt wants news of his son, Reuters reported, citing a newspaper report. Madonna has custody of the boy. ''I don't have her phone and mailing address,'' the father, Yohane Banda, left, told The Daily Times, based in Blantyre, Malawi. ''All I want is to find out how my son is, but I don't know how I can do it. I only talked to her once at the High Court, and I want to talk to her now and find out about my child.'' Mr. Banda, the father of David Banda, 1, spoke to the newspaper after it presented him with $788 from a Scottish nun, Christine Webster, who told the paper she believed that the child would have been better off in Malawi. Mr. Banda dismissed suggestions that he was seeking the boy's return and asked human rights organizations that opposed the adoption to refrain from interfering with his attempts to talk with Madonna. ''All I want is to find out how my child is doing and not to have him back,'' he was quoted as saying. The adoption last year by Madonna, under an interim order, prompted questions about the use of celebrity to circumvent laws governing adoption of Malawians by foreigners. 'CSI' Creates New Crime Scene ''CSI'' is branching out of television and into museums across the country, Variety.com reported. The ''CSI'' show that makes its debut on May 25 won't be ''CSI: Chicago.''

Visitors will be able to gather evidence from fictional crime scenes and test it inside laboratories and autopsy rooms with the help of multimedia presentations and recorded video messages from stars of the three ''CSI'' programs on CBS. In September, after the exhibition spends the summer in Chicago, it will begin a national tour of science museums that could last as long as seven years. The exhibition is financed by the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, CBS Consumer Products and the National Science Foundation.

A1 The head of Turkey's armed forces said that he was prepared to conduct operations in northern Iraq to crush Kurdish rebels hiding there. The remarks increased pressure on Iraq over the presence of the rebels. A8 Wolfowitz Accused of Cronyism Paul D. Wolfowitz's tenure as president of the World Bank was thrown into turmoil by the disclosure that he had helped arrange a pay raise for his companion at the time of her transfer from the bank to the State Department, where she remained on the bank payroll.

A7 NATIONAL A10-14 E-Mail May Include Some On Firings of Attorneys The White House said that missing e-mail sent on Republican Party accounts may include some relating to the firings of eight United States attorneys. The disclosure became a fresh political problem for the White House, as Democrats stepped up their inquiry into the use of the e-mail accounts.

Bloomberg of New York announced the addition of 14 mayors from Ohio and Kentucky to his coalition and unveiled a campaign to pressure Congress to allow cities to share data on illegal guns.

Yet Mr. Bermudez is still behind bars, his appeals denied. That is because the American justice system tends to view recantations as an act not of conscience, but of sympathy, bribery or coercion.

The interns help Izzie cope with the death of her fiancé, Denny, and her decision to quit. Chief Webber gets a comeuppance from his wife after he spends the night in his office.

Fox rebroadcast a ''Hell's Kitchen'' at 8 p.m. and then showed a new episode at 9 p.m., which brought in an estimated 7.39 million viewers and the night's highest 18-to-49 rating. The draw in that demographic was enough to give Fox an overall win. CBS's schedule of repeats was No. 1 among total viewers. Its rerun of ''CSI: Miami'' (11.1 million) at 10 p.m. was Monday's most-watched show. During that hour, ABC's dating reality series ''How to Get the Guy'' continued to tank in its second week, delivering only 3.8 million viewers. NBC broadcast Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals.

On NBC, a one-hour ''Will & Grace'' retrospective (drawing what Nielsen estimated at 12.7 million viewers) led into the final episode at 9 p.m. (18.1 million) of the show, featuring Debra Messing, left; its strong performance helped the season finale of ''ER'' (16.7 million) at 10. On Fox, the end of ''That 70's Show'' offered the return of Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher, and delivered 9.8 million viewers. That led into the season finale of the sinking ''O.C.''

That's the cheeky suggestion made recently by the British actor, novelist, critic and all-around cultural Renaissance guy Stephen Fry. ''I shouldn't be saying this -- high treason really -- but I sometimes wonder if Americans aren't fooled by our accent into detecting a brilliance that may not really be there,'' he told the British magazine Radio Times. ''I mean, would they notice if Jeremy Irons or Judi Dench gave a bad performance? Not that those two paragons ever would, but it's worth considering.'' Blimey, that's food for thought, as is this: ''When American TV and movies call for a twist of limey in their cocktail, it's usually a character they're after -- supervillain, emotionally constipated academic, effete eccentric, that kind of thing.'' He may be on to something there. After all, didn't the creators of the three-part ''Die Hard'' franchise twice reach out for Britons -- Mr. Irons and Alan Rickman -- to play foils both evil and classy enough to square off against Bruce Willis?"

On NBC Patricia Arquette fans -- or is it really the Jake Weber fans who keep this show afloat? -- get the delayed return of ''MEDIUM'' (Wednesday, 9 p.m.). CBS offers the premiere of ''3 LBS.,'' with Stanley Tucci as a tetchy brain surgeon (Tuesday, 10 p.m.); the obvious comparison is to ''House,'' but the first episode hedges its bets by undercutting the wounded-genius solemnity with some ''Grey's Anatomy'' shamelessness. And ABC trots out its temporary replacement for ''Lost'': the new Taye Diggs vehicle, ''DAY BREAK'' (Wednesday, 9 p.m.), a k a ''Law & Order: Groundhog Day,'' in which Mr. Diggs's framed-for-murder cop keeps reliving the same very bad day. The sci-fi gimmick looks like an attempt to get the feel of ''24'' without resorting to that show's baroque plot twists, or to the endless flashbacks of ''The Nine''; time will tell. Cable has a kinder, gentler sweeps gift: the ''MONK'' holiday special (USA, Friday, 9 p.m.), a typically shaggy and sentimental mystery that introduces Dan Hedaya as Monk's father. On PBS, where the sweeps ratings don't matter, the most interesting show of the week (not counting the much-talked-about-already finale of ''Prime Suspect'') may be one decidedly lacking in comfort and joy: the ''FRONTLINE'' installment ''A Hidden Life,'' which examines the sad, strange case of James West, the former Republican mayor of Spokane, Wash. (Tuesday night on most PBS stations; check local listings). No one comes off very well in this retelling, including the editors and reporters at the local newspaper who outed Mr. West in the process of printing accusations that he had abused young men. In outlining his personal and political implosion, the documentary, almost despite itself, ends up casting its protagonist as his own greatest victim. But the creepily bland Mr. West, interviewed for the program several times before his death from cancer in July, does nothing to earn that mantle."

A new series, ''Standoff,'' about a romance between two F.B.I. hostage negotiators, benefited from the ''House'' lead-in and handily bested its competitors, although it garnered an unimpressive 66 percent retention of adults 18 to 49. Despite the Fox onslaught, new episodes of two CBS reality shows fared relatively well: ''Big Brother'' drew 9 million and ''Rock Star: Supernova'' 7.63 million. NBC and ABC brought up the rear with repeats, though NBC won 10 p.m. with the fan favorite ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' (8.7 million). The newcomer MyNetworkTV also began its two telenovelas, ''Desire'' and ''Fashion House,'' which both attracted meager audiences. BENJAMIN TOFF"

But thousands of smaller used- and rare-book merchants, like Rob Stuart, above, owner of Frenchboro Books in Maine, say they will suffer, because they rely on foreign demand. E-Commerce Report: Bob Tedeschi. [C6.] A MERGER COMES UNDONE -- Miles S. Nadal, the chairman and chief executive of MDC Partners, hopes to get ahead in the intensely competitive advertising industry with a contrarian strategy of almost continuous change.

Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C1.] PROXIES CLEAR AS MUD -- The Securities and Exchange Commission's new disclosure rules on executive pay were supposed to make it easier for investors to understand how top managers were being paid.

[C6.] A FAKE MYSPACE PROMOTION -- The MySpace fan page with a hot pink background, tribute to Robin Sparkles, a one-hit Canadian teenage pop star from the early 1990s, was just gushing enough to be real. But it wasn't. The MySpace page was a plant, concocted by the producers of the CBS sitcom ''How I Met Your Mother,'' to play off a storyline in the show's Nov. 20 episode. [C8.] EXCLUSIVE TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE -- Samuel Zell, who has agreed to buy the Tribune Company, gave his first interview exclusively to The Chicago Tribune.

I've been thinking about those words in the context of private equity lately. How does this business make so much money? Are there really a huge number of mispriced securities out there?

ABC began its night with an original episode of ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' (9.46 million) at 7 p.m. CBS easily won that hour, as N.C.A.A. basketball spilled over into prime time on the East Coast, helping to lift ''60 Minutes'' in the preliminary ratings.

Patti Goldstein began her career as a publicist first for CBS television and later for NBC television where she was Manager of Magazine Publicity. In 1962, she became a partner in her own public relations agency, Addison, Goldstein &amp; Walsh.

In 1986, she wrote the musical fable ``The Cat that Saved the Kingdom'' with score by the late Joe Raposo. The fable was performed at Lincoln Center with full symphony orchestra and six cats and reviewed by the New York Times. Ms. Goldstein also worked in television production.

The good news for ABC is that ''Grey's Anatomy'' -- in which Meredith (Ellen Pompeo, above) went on a date with her new veterinarian love interest, Finn (Chris O'Donnell) -- increased its audience compared with the same time last year.

Google said it earned $733 million in the third quarter, up 92 percent from a year ago. Revenue climbed to $2.69 billion, with 44 percent of that coming from outside the United States. [Page C3.] DOW ABOVE 12,000 -- The Dow Jones industrial average closed above the psychologically important 12,000 level for the first time, indicating that investors were increasingly confident that the economy was poised to perform the rare feat of slowing without stalling. The performance in the months ahead will depend, in part, how gracefully the economy handles the slowing housing market. [C1.] BIG BANK EARNINGS -- Citigroup seemed to stumble and Bank of America appeared to strut through a messy third quarter as the country's two biggest banks contended with pressures of a slowing economy and higher interest rates. [C3] CBS SETTLES ACCUSATIONS -- CBS became the first radio corporation to settle accusations of illicit pay-for-play practices made by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general. CBS, which runs approximately 180 radio stations, agreed to adopt more stringent policies on its stations' dealings with record labels and to make a $2 million payment to New York charities. [C3.] MEDICINE VS. MARKETING -- For many doctors, it's an irresistible pitch: a $250 profit from a 15-minute test. With that lure, some 12,000 of the nation's physicians have purchased an automated device that checks patients for nerve disease. Specialists say the problem is that many general practitioners are not qualified to do such tests. [A1.] HIGHER PROFITS AT DRUG MAKERS -- Drug makers continued to post strong profit gains, led by Pfizer, the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, which reported that its third-quarter earnings had more than doubled from a year earlier. Eli Lilly, Novartis, and Wyeth also reported higher quarterly profits. [C2] VIDEO GAME WARS -- Laying the groundwork for a battle against rival Microsoft, Sony said that 21 games would be available for the PlayStation 3 game console when it goes on sale next month. Sony also plans to highlight the console's ability to play high-definition DVD's in Sony's Blu-ray format. [C11.] BANNER YEAR IN HONG KONG -- In a reflection of China's growing prominence in international finance, Hong Kong is set for a banner year in global markets with more money raised by companies selling shares to the public here than on the biggest exchanges in New York and London. Pricing will be set today for the world's largest IPO ever, that of China's biggest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. [C1.] BEYOND REGULATORS' REACH -- Every month, roughly 19,000 households across the country write check to Christian Care Ministry. The members pool their health expenses and contributions and the ministry writes checks to health care providers. Such payments totaled $57 million in the latest fiscal year. While ministry members say they are helping to carry each others burdens, some Florida state officials see what they would call unregulated health insurance. [C1.] RULING AGAINST GRASSO -- A New York judge ruled that Richard A. Grasso, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, would have to return as much as $100 million of a fiercely contested $139.5 million retirement payout to the exchange The judge, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said that Mr. Grasso did not disclose to his fellow directors on the board of the exchange the extent to which his soaring compensation had caused his pension and savings to balloon. [A1.] MERGER REVERBERATIONS -- The $8 billion combination of Chicago's derivatives markets is being heralded as good for Chicago and good for the exchanges. But in Europe, it is raising concerns at banks and rival exchanges that it may increase costs or stifle competition. One of the biggest fears in London where the local derivatives exchange will be dwarfed, is that it creates a so-called vertical silo, or a market where one giant entity is both a trading platform and a clearing system. [C8.] NBC STAFF CUTBACKS -- NBC said it planned to reduce its 6,000-person newsgathering staff by an estimated 5 percent, or 300 people to adapt to the migration of news viewers to the Internet and eliminate overlaps in news coverage. Steve Capus, president of NBC News, said the bulk of the cuts would come from eliminating jobs already vacant, as well as from early retirements and voluntary buyouts, but that some layoffs were inevitable. [C4.] LOWER COST PROGRAMMING -- As part of the extensive cost-cutting program it announced yesterday, NBC intends to dramatically alter its prime-time programming, starting in the fall of 2007, filling the 8 p.m. hour each night of the week with lower-cost, unscripted programs and saving its more expensive scripted comedies and dramas for the 9-to-11 block. [C1.] WEAK NEWSPAPER PROFITS -- Newspaper companies continued to show weakness, with The New York Times Company and the Tribune Company both reporting lackluster earnings, citing soft advertising sales as a major culprit. At the Times Company, the slowdown ''is expected to continue through the end of the year,'' said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. [C7.] ONLINE Business Briefing Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business. McDonald's reported a 15 percent rise in third-quarter profitmeeting a better-than-expected forecast it gave last week.

(BLOOMBERG NEWS) Travelers packed planes operated by Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines over the summer, but Continental's third-quarter profit grew while Southwest's earnings fell in another sign that traditional carriers were narrowing the gap with low-cost rivals.

A1 Rivals Clash in Spanish Voting Spaniards go to the polls Sunday to elect local and regional officials, but parochial concerns have been overshadowed by a debate between the Socialist prime minister and the leader of the conservative Popular Party. The vote is in many ways a dry run for next year's general election. A9 British Terror Trials Criticized Peter Clarke, the head of British counterterrorism at Scotland Yard, criticized what he called excessive secrecy in Britain's terrorism trials.

No team with a record as bad as the Saints' 3-13 last season had ever made the conference championship the next season. But here are the Saints, and, tailback Deuce McAllister said, ''This may be destiny.'' It may be many things, but two stand out: Can the Bears' celebrated defense rise from the doldrums and handle McAllister, quarterback Drew Brees, the all-around threat Reggie Bush and those dangerous receivers? Which Rex Grossman will show up at quarterback for the Bears? Last week, Grossman was mostly good in an overtime victory against the Seahawks, and the Saints' secondary has been vulnerable to the long pass. Grossman was erratic during the regular season, with 23 touchdown passes and 20 interceptions. ''What's important is those players have a belief in him,'' Saints Coach Sean Payton said. Although the Bears' defense has lost some of its dominance because of injuries, linebacker Lance Briggs said, ''We tweak a little, we're right back where we were.''

They beat the Patriots 11 weeks ago, when Brady threw four interceptions, and he threw three last week against the Chargers. Still, the Patriots have won five straight games, and they always seem to come up with defensive innovations. They will need offensive fire because the Colts, who have suffered on defense all season, have turned into a defensive power. Reporter's Pick: Patriots"

The mean-spirited dance competition led Fox to a victory in total viewers and among adults 18 to 49; it also drew the highest 18-to-34 ratings of any show so far this summer season. But NBC was No. 1 in households for the night. Its two-hour ''Dateline: To Catch a Predator'' delivered 7.8 million viewers, and a ''Law & Order'' rerun brought in 7.9 million. CBS's ''Game Show Marathon'' is proving to be no ''Deal or No Deal'' ratings-wise. It attracted 6.9 million viewers at 8 p.m. and dragged down the rest of CBS's schedule, reruns of ''Criminal Minds'' (8 million) and ''CSI: New York'' (9.3 million). Sunday's season finale of ''The Sopranos'' drew 8.9 million viewers. That was a drop from its last season-ender, in June 2004, which brought in an audience of just under 11 million. The show returned this year after a long hiatus. KATE AURTHUR"

And for the network's soap opera schedule -- ''All My Children,'' ''One Life to Live'' and ''General Hospital'' -- it was the sixth consecutive sweeps period that ABC won in the 18-to-49 age group. Among total viewers ABC's daytime dramas delivered an average audience of 3.38 million, which was second to CBS's 3.88 million. CBS's ''Young & the Restless'' was the top-rated soap opera among 18-to-49-year-old women, but over all, the network tied with NBC for second place in that demographic. The History Channel's Memorial Day broadcast of ''Washington the Warrior,'' an examination of George Washington as a military leader, brought in 2.47 million viewers. Yesterday Nielsen Media Research did not release its overnight ratings for Sunday because of what it said was an error in processing them. KATE AURTHUR"

In Nielsen's estimates for this sweeps night, the psychic drama drew 10.03 million viewers, which was good enough for second place. But Ms. Ringwald's appearance competed with the No. 1 show of the night, CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' (18.68 million), in which viewers saw a human foot yanked from a dead shark. CBS was first for the night among total viewers, but second to Fox in the 18-to-49 demographic. In that age group CBS was dragged down, as it often is, by ''King of Queens'' (7.54 million) and ''How I Met Your Mother'' (7.34 million). Filling the 8 p.m. hour, those sitcoms placed fourth among adults 18 to 49, behind NBC's ''Deal or No Deal,'' Fox's ''Prison Break'' and ABC's ''Wife Swap.'' And ''Mother'' barely scraped by the second half of the WB's ''Seventh Heaven,'' beating the soon-to-conclude family drama by only two-tenths of a ratings point in the demographic advertisers pay a premium to reach.

But the real rush of the broadcast networks' season and series premieres won't come for another month yet. For the intervening dog days of cable, when the best bet on any given night is likely to be a ''House'' rerun or a special episode of ''Trick My Truck,'' DVD's may be the best way to get your television fix. So here, plucked from the flood of TV shows making their way onto their video shelves, are some current and soon-to-be released discs that caught the eyes of writers for The New York Times. The shows range from comedies to dramas to cartoons to classical music, with an emphasis on box sets of seasons that have only recently ended. That reflects the marketplace: a glance at the various (and often highly contradictory) charts of DVD sales demonstrates that while home entertainment companies keep releasing lovingly packaged collections of classic shows, people keep buying the new stuff. And there's also an emphasis on shows from HBO. That reflects the fact that people who write about TV like to write about HBO. Happy clicking. SURFACE: THE COMPLETE SERIES (Universal, $49.98) The often disparaging chatter about the fact that there were three new alien-invasion shows on last fall's schedule -- one each on ABC, CBS and NBC -- obscured the fact that two of them were pretty good (and that the third, ''Threshold'' on CBS, starred Carla Gugino, which made up for a lot). The first and, as of now, final seasons of all three are out on DVD this month: ''Threshold: The Complete Series'' (Paramount, $54.99), ''Invasion: The Complete Series'' (Warner, $59.98) and the gem of the bunch, the 15 episodes of the NBC series ''Surface.''"

CBS, led by reruns of ''CSI'' (12.37 million) and ''Without a Trace'' (11.1 million), appeared to be No. 1 among total viewers but was dragged down by ''Game Show Marathon'' at 8 (6.84 million). CBS placed fourth for the night among adults 18 to 49. Fox was second behind ABC in that age group: a rerun of ''So You Think You Can Dance'' (6.37 million) was followed by a new episode (10 million). And NBC broadcast four repeats of ''My Name Is Earl,'' along with the premiere of ''Windfall.'' That be-careful-what-you-wish-for lottery drama delivered 8.98 million viewers at 10 and beat ''Without a Trace'' in the 18-to-49 demographic.

Robert lived the last ten years in Oregon, living between Cape Mears and the downtown Portland Area. While in Portland, he enjoyed the city in no small measure, attending the Symphony, the Opera, and a unique relationship with Portland State University as a member of the Friends of the Library, the PSU Foundation, and serving on the committee to select a new librarian. Prior to his residence in Portland, Robert lived in Coalville, Utah, for eighteen years and served as Summit County Treasurer, co-founder of KPCW public radio in Park City, from where he would broadcast a weekly classical music program. Robert also owned Ryan's Bar and Dolly's Bookstore on Main Street in Park City. His primary career was as an insurance broker to the entertainment industry from 1952 to 1979 in Los Angeles, California, where he worked for the Fireman's Fund, CBS, and as owner and president of the Albert G. Ruben Company. In this capacity, Robert worked with some of the great talent agencies and studios in Hollywood, and innovated preproduction insurance for the movie industry. He was a graduate of Dartmouth College, class of 1947, and served in the United States Navy during World War Two. He was born to Lida and Frank O. Williams, October 31, 1925, in Kingston, Pennsylvania moving soon thereafter to Maplewood, New Jersey, living there until he went to college. Robert is survived by his wife of 57 years, Joan Hackett Williams of Portland, Oregon, sons Kenneth Shales of Portland Oregon, Mayor Robert Dana of Park City, Utah, Evan David of Salt Lake City, Utah, Todd Jeffery of Los Angeles, California Grant Edward of San Diego, California, ten grand children and one greatgrandchild. The family wishes to express a warm thanksgiving to all who have contributed to the life and times of this wonderful man and to assure each one of them that they are remembered well through the memories, stories, and attributes each gave to him in his life. These gifts remain in us now and we are forever grateful to you all. Our lives will be his memorial. Respectfully, The Williams Family"

As journalists know, such government hearings can deter reporting of news to inform the public, particularly about government misconduct. They also scare away news sources.

Companies like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo find themselves going after the same candidates or recruiting in one another's backyards. At the same time, they are running up against a myriad of start-up companies across Silicon Valley. To lure talent, these companies have expanded their recruiting arsenal far beyond the traditional job fair to include events like technology lectures, cocktail parties, pizza parties, treasure hunts and programming contests, called ''code jams'' or ''hack days.'' [Page C1.] LOOKING FOR STARS Despite being the first and certainly the largest African-American cable channel, Black Entertainment Television has developed few of its own marketable stars and virtually no breakout programs. It relies on reruns, movies and music videos for the bulk of its lineup. The chief executive of BET, Debra L. Lee, has tried to reverse that trend, this year increasing the channel's production budget 50 percent and plunging into original programming with 16 new shows for the fall. [C1.] POLICEMAN, NOT A REPORTER David Cunningham, a prominent protester who heads the Anti-Poverty Committee in Vancouver, British Columbia, recently received a call from someone who said he was a reporter named Peter MacKay from the free daily tabloid 24 Hours Vancouver. But when Mr. Cunningham arrived outside a shopping mall for what he thought would be an interview, Peter MacKay turned out to be a plainclothes police officer who arrested him. Someone in the Vancouver Police Department thought the deception was a clever way to lure Mr. Cunningham, but the ruse provoked widespread criticism from civil rights and journalism groups. [C4.] HIGH ASPIRATIONS Though far from a household name in telecommunications, Altimo, the Russian telecommunications investment company, has aspirations of becoming a global power. But the problem it faces, some analysts say, is that at this point, Altimo has made few allies. If it is known beyond Russia at all, it is for its propensity to fight tenaciously in court and on corporate boards for its ambitions, some say. [C5.] THE MALE DIETER The face of dieting may be changing. Of the 72 million people dieting in the United States, 38 percent -- about 28 million -- are men, according to Marketdata Enterprises, a market research company. It estimates that the diet industry will be $58.7 billion this year. And NutriSystem has hired its first male spokesman, the former quarterback Dan Marino, and has started advertising in Sports Illustrated, Men's Health and ESPN magazine. [C3.] MAINSTREAM PROMOTION Mel Gibson's 2004 film ''The Passion of the Christ'' demonstrated to Hollywood just how many evangelical moviegoers there are and how much money can be made from them. Mindful of that market, Universal Pictures has teamed up with Grace Hill Media, a public relations firm that reaches out to religious groups, to publicize the mainstream film ''Evan Almighty.'' Scheduled for wide release on June 22, it stars Steve Carell as a politician who abandons Congress in order to build an ark, taking off on the story of Noah. [C3.] TALLYING GLIMPSES When the sleek yacht of the Luna Rossa team sailed away with a victory in the America's Cup semifinals, there were two vital results. The Italian crew eliminated the American team of BMW Oracle Racing with a 33-second lead. And fleeting glimpses of the flapping mainsails -- branded with logos of Telecom Italia Mobile and the broadband service Alice -- reached millions of television viewers. Those glimpses are now being counted down to the second, categorized by clear and partial visibility, tallied by major countries and then compared with the cost of traditional spot advertisements. [C2.] WEB PROPERTY DEVELOPER NameMedia, a privately held owner and developer of Web sites based in Waltham, Mass., is best seen as an online property developer, its chief executive, Kelly P. Conlin, said. Analysts suggest that NameMedia and its competitors could represent the next wave of Internet initial public offerings, while also providing a peek at a significant change in what people see when they stumble onto obscure Web properties. Bob Tedeschi, E-Commerce Report. [C5.] THE TOUCH-UP In a situation not as emotionally charged as when Time magazine darkened O.J. Simpson's mug shot on its cover a decade ago, no fewer than three magazines were reacting to claims last week that they had doctored their covers -- and one retouched celebrity even cried foul. [C4.] A PULITZER AWARD Often the writing and photography that win Pulitzer Prizes require heroic efforts. For one recipient, Jahangir Razmi , the process of receiving the award also took 27 years. In 1979, Mr. Razmi stood near executioners as they shot Kurdish prisoners in Sanandaj, Iran. One picture was picked up by the wire service United Press International. To protect Mr. Razmi, his name was never printed. But after decades of keeping silent, Mr. Razmi allowed his name to appear in a December 2006 article in The Wall Street Journal, which prompted the Pulitzer Prize Board to seek out Mr. Razmi to award him the prize in person. [C4.] VIEWER REVOLT The cancellation of the CBS series ''Jericho'' has led to a viewer revolt that has included not only the usual petition drives, but also the delivery of tons of nuts (mostly walnuts, but also peanuts and pecans) to the two responsible CBS executives. [C4.] THE PRETEEN MARKET With a faithful audience in the millions, magazines for the early teenage years are in overdrive, bolstered by last year's enthusiasm for new stars from the Disney Channel's hit ''High School Musical,'' which made household names not only of Zac Efron and Corbin Bleu, but also of Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Anne Hudgens.

''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' has come and gone, but on Friday night CBS is hauling out a block of oldies narrated by long-dead celebrities. It begins at 8 with ''RUDOLPH, THE RED-NOSED REINDEER,'' first shown in 1964 and narrated by Burl Ives. Four decades later it seems as if an elf who really wants to be a dentist has always been part of Rudolph's story. But the song's original plot is around, too: glowing-nosed outcast, ridiculed and banned from reindeer games, leads Santa's sleigh through a foggy Christmas Eve and saves the holiday. ''FROSTY THE SNOWMAN'' (1969), narrated by the great Jimmy Durante, follows at 9, with its tale of a magic hat that brings a snowman to life and the little children who set out to save Frosty when he begins to melt. Unfortunately the original ''Frosty'' is only a half-hour long, so CBS has scheduled its highly inferior 1992 sequel, ''FROSTY RETURNS,'' at 9:30. Could be a good time to walk the dog. And now for something completely unholidaylike: PATRICK STEWART, lauded interpreter of Shakespeare, Dickens and ''Star Trek,'' stars in a new offering from BBC America. In ''THE ELEVENTH HOUR,'' a four-hour, four-part series beginning Monday at 9 p.m., he plays Ian Hood, a government science adviser (and former physics professor) whose raison d'être is preventing mad, evil or simply misguided scientists from misusing technology. Hood's hobby appears to be making his bodyguard (Ashley Jensen) crazy. In the first episode he goes after a mastermind nicknamed Geppetto, who is heading an ambitious human cloning project. The first clue is 27 graves of malformed fetuses, each buried with a cross (not by Geppetto) and each with the same DNA."

The country's support for the war in Iraq is nearly unanimous and it was one of the first allies to send troops to Afghanistan and one of the first to join the forces in Iraq. A1 Putin Elaborates on Missiles President Vladimir V. Putin offered suggestions for alternatives to a missile defense system in Europe, saying Russia would not object to American interceptor missiles in Iraq, Turkey or at sea, and proposed that Russia and the West study emerging missile threats together. A6 Report on Secret C.I.A. Prisons In a report, the lead investigator for the Council of Europe gave a bleak description of secret prisons run by the Central Intelligence Agency in Eastern Europe, with information he said was gleaned from anonymous intelligence agents, many of whom wanted to unburden themselves. A7 Separatist Arrested in Spain The Spanish police arrested Arnaldo Otegi, the leader of the political wing of the violent Basque separatist group ETA, according to an official from the National Court. The move signaled a new government crackdown after the group renounced a 15-month cease-fire.

The restrictions were originally imposed by Gen. Pervez Musharraf last March. A7 Italy Prosecutes C.I.A.

Peter Pace to a second term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, making him the highest-ranking officer to be a political casualty of the fight over Iraq. A1 Court Ruling is Criticized A decision by the Supreme Court earlier this week that made it easier for prosecutors to exclude from capital juries people who express reservations about the death penalty will produce whiter and more conviction-prone juries, experts in law and psychology said. A1 Paris Hilton Returned to Jail The national obsession with celebrity collided head-on with the more serious issue of the equal application of justice, as a judge sent the socialite Paris Hilton back to jail some 36 hours after she was released with an ankle monitor for an unspecified medical problem.

A9 Nominee Draws Criticism President Bush's nomination of Dr. James W.

The couple will be at R. J. Julia, a bookstore in Madison, Conn., on May 9 and at the public library in Westport, Conn., on May 22 to promote ''Green This! Volume 1: Greening Your Cleaning,'' a paperback guide to environmentally friendly house cleaning. ''There are many booksellers who wanted her to appear and still do,'' David Rosenthal, publisher of Simon & Schuster, said. Mr. Imus, he added, had offered to join his wife, but the details have not yet been worked out. The book was published April 10, just days before CBS Radio canceled ''Imus in the Morning'' after he made racially and sexually derogatory remarks about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. A day after the cancellation, Simon & Schuster postponed Ms. Imus's tour, citing the ''enormous pressure that Deirdre and her family are under.'' That tour was also to have included numerous television appearances, with Mr. Imus included on two of them: ''Larry King Live'' on CNN and ''The Tim Russert Show'' on CNBC. Victoria Meyer, a spokeswoman for Simon & Schuster, said that television appearances were again under discussion but that nothing had been scheduled.

The decision comes a year after the agency's safety reviewers strongly recommended just such a step. It also occurs during a Congressional inquiry into why the agency delayed its warnings about Avandia. [Page A1.] A medical researcher told a House hearing about name-calling and a veiled threat of a lawsuit by a drug company executive after the researcher had criticized Avandia. [A30.] CHINA TO OVERHAUL FOOD LAWS -- China said that it was overhauling its food and drug safety regulations and would introduce nationwide inspections. The announcement was a response to growing international concerns about tainted food and counterfeit drugs. [A1.] A BOOMING BUSINESS IN AUTO PARTS -- China's auto parts exports have increased more than sixfold in the last five years, nearly topping $1 billion in April, and are part of a broader shift as China moves up from basic goods like textiles and shoes toward higher-value industrial goods that compete directly with countries like the United States. [C1.] AUTOMAKERS OPPOSE ENERGY BILL -- The chief executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met with Senate lawmakers, less than a week before Democrats plan a vote on a sprawling energy bill, and asserted that the bill's proposed increase in mileage requirements would be impossible to meet and would gravely damage the industry.

Gere's Kisses Reach Court India's overburdened judicial system has two new cases after three lawyers filed complaints against Richard Gere, 57, for kissing the actress Shilpa Shetty, below, 31, at an AIDS awareness rally in New Delhi, The Associated Press reported. Public displays of affection are largely taboo in India. In one complaint a lawyer accused the actors of committing ''an obscene act,'' the Press Trust of India reported. Two other lawyers filed another complaint in Ghaziabad, a town on the outskirts of New Delhi, naming Ms. Shetty and private television channels for showing videos of the incident. Ms. Shetty said the hug and kisses were not obscene and that the public was overreacting. Yesterday, her representative, Dale Bhagwagar, declined comment on the court complaints but said, ''The media should concentrate on the cause of AIDS awareness rather than making an issue out of kisses.''"

For those who never saw the movie, it's a woman who can sing, dance, bartend and ''flare'' (translation: juggle bottles, shakers and glasses à la Tom Cruise in ''Cocktail'') better than any other. And yep, she has to be pretty. In the finale of this reality series, Liliana Lovell, the founder of Coyote Ugly -- originally a rowdy watering hole in Manhattan's East Village, and now a chain -- takes five finalists (above, from left, Gina, Kassie, Tess, Amber and Michaela) down to New Orleans, where they'll put on their best barkeep behavior to win $25,000, and center stage, on the night of that city's Coyote re-opening. 8 P.M. (CBS) A DR. PHIL PRIME-TIME SPECIAL: ESCAPING DANGER -- According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, 691,710 nonfatal acts of domestic violence were committed in the United States in 2001; 85 percent of these were against women. And in 2000, 1,247 women and 440 men were killed by an intimate partner. In this hourlong special, Dr. Phil McGraw gets inside the mind of a young mother whose husband has held her captive through terror and counsels her on life-saving decisions. And then he confronts her abuser with a not-to-beignored request that he take responsibility for his actions. 9 P.M. (CBS) CLOSE TO HOME -- Season finale. Annabeth (Jennifer Finnigan, right) prosecutes two teenagers for the murder of a man they claim was an online sexual predator. But then death hits even closer to home. 9 P.M. (NBC) CONVICTION -- In yet another episode ripped from the headlines, a bouncer becomes the prime suspect when a woman is murdered after leaving a bar. At 10, a courthouse shootout leaves the staff of the assistant district attorney's office otherwise occupied. 10 P.M. (CBS) NUMB3RS -- It's easy to blame Mom. In this season finale, Olympia Dukakis plays the mother of a rapist-turned-serial killer -- and you know where that story line is headed -- and JoBeth Williams portrays Margaret Eppes, the dead mother whose memory Charlie (David Krumholtz) has never laid to rest. 10 P.M. (CMT) UNSUNG STORIES -- Many a country song has sprung from a kernel of truth. That's the premise behind this new series in which professional songwriters take a real event and transform it into lyrics and music. First up, ''Jake's Goin' All the Way,'' an anthem by Jeffrey Steele and Keith Anderson (above right, with Mr. Steele) about a developmentally disabled teenager whose touchdown on a football field touched an entire community.

Instead, that role is being played by a fellow Democrat, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. Judging by some of the political name-calling in the final days before the elections, Ms. Pelosi seems to be in the thick of campaigns for Congress from Illinois to Georgia and several places in between. She is the unwitting star of at least a half-dozen television spots -- and countless radio spots, direct-mail campaigns and candidate debates --warning voters that if they choose their local Democrat for Congress, they are also casting a vote for Ms. Pelosi."

Paulson Jr., chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, to become his next Treasury secretary. Behind the News -- In some ways, an odd choice. Mr. Paulson is a deficit hawk while the administration has built up historic budget deficits. But many allies of the White House had lobbied for him, convinced he could help convey the strengths in the economy and reassure voters of the president's economic competence. Mr. Paulson had to be carefully courted, a sign of the prestige the job has lost under Mr. Bush. THE NONCIVILIAN The News -- Gen. Michael V. Hayden was sworn in as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Behind the News -- At the ceremony Wednesday, President Bush felt compelled to give agency employees a pep talk, assuring them that they remained ''vital'' to the White House. The event was for public consumption. (The general officially became director Tuesday.) The administration wanted to lift agency morale and portray a sense of calm after several turbulent years at the C.I.A. Sensitivity lingers over a military officer leading the civilian agency. THE GOLDEN ARM The News -- Roger Clemens, the future Hall of Fame pitcher, agreed to come out of retirement and rejoin the Houston Astros. Behind the News -- A break for the struggling Astros, the defending National League champions. Clemens turns 44 in August but is hardly teetering. He led the major leagues with a 1.87 earned run average last year. His time off could keep him fresh in September. Three other 43-year-old pitchers are still kicking: Terry Mulholland of Arizona, Jaimie Moyer of Seattle and David Wells of Boston. One subplot: Clemens's son Koby, an infielder in Houston's minor league system, could join his father soon. THE NEW CHILD The News -- Well, not so new a child. Prince Albert II of Monaco acknowledged that he is the father of a 14-year-old American girl, a lawyer for the prince's family, Thierry Lacoste, told Le Figaro, a French newspaper. Officials in Monaco said they would not comment on the matter. Behind the News -- Last year, Prince Albert, who is not married, acknowledged that he was the father of a 3-year-old boy. He later told The New York Times that he did not know of any other paternity claims that could be true. Mr. Lacoste told Le Figaro that legal paternity was established several weeks ago. THE LONG FAREWELL The News -- Katie Couric spent her final day as anchor of ''Today.'' Now it's on to the ''CBS Evening News'' in September. Behind the News -- For weeks, NBC built a relentless drumbeat of publicity. Then came Wednesday's lovefest packed with memories and tributes. Was it too much? It could have ''turned unbearably cloying but didn't, mainly because Ms. Couric reined in her emotions and did not exit in a puddle of tears,'' wrote Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times. But David Hinckley of The Daily News said the show was ''more like a long in-house graduation party.''"

So she sends them to acting class. Another A.D.A. (Eric Balfour) runs into a ''wall of blue'' prosecuting his latest case. 11 P.M.

''That's what I do,'' he says. ''It's fun.'' Almost a decade ago, at 62, he founded WR Hambrecht + Company, whose fundamental premise is that companies don't need to use Wall Street investment bankers -- and pay their outrageous fees -- to go public. Hambrecht + Company has since become so threatening to traditional underwriters that they often refuse to be involved in any I.P.O. in which his firm takes part. And now, at an age when most people are well into retirement, he has decided to tackle the establishment again. This time, though, the establishment isn't Wall Street. It's the National Football League. Bill Hambrecht, you see, is starting up a professional football league. So far, he and his partner, Tim Armstrong, a senior executive at Google, have pledged $2 million each. They've hired a C.E.O. and a C.O.O., both of whom cut their teeth at the National Basketball Association. They've got a name: the United Football League. And they've lined up a wealthy, well-known businessman as their first owner: Mark Cuban, the billionaire who owns the N.B.A.'s Dallas Mavericks. Like Hambrecht, Cuban loves nothing more than confronting the status quo."

ABC's hourlong ''Dancing'' was the most-watched program of the night, with 13.67 million viewers, but CBS's lineup -- ''Ghost Whisperer'' (10.98 million), ''Close to Home'' (11.14 million) and ''Numbers'' (12.77 million) -- won the night both in total viewers and among adults 18 to 49. ABC was a competitive second place in both of those areas, as its new legal drama, ''In Justice,'' held up fairly well in its second week (8.73 million on Friday versus 9.17 million on Jan. 6).

Behind the News -- The two countries' relationship has come a long way since 1979, when the United States severed relations, and particularly since 1988, when Libyan agents blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland, killing 270. Libya did its part by abandoning unconventional weapons and renouncing terrorism. But in some ways the world has also passed Libya by, and with Iraq, Afghanistan, Al Qaeda and now Iran, the United States has bigger fish to fry. IRAQ The News -- A panel of judges in the trial of Saddam Hussein approved formal charges of crimes against humanity in the case. Behind the News -- The ruling means that Mr. Hussein and seven co-defendants would almost certainly face the death penalty if convicted. Mr. Hussein and the others are on trial in connection with the execution of 148 Shiites in 1982. Convictions would not come anytime soon, however. The trial has already gone on for more than seven months -- the judges' ruling came after the prosecution presented its evidence -- and is expected to continue into the fall. WASHINGTON The News -- Less than a day after the deadline for enrollment in the Medicare prescription drug program, a bipartisan group of senators pushed to eliminate the penalty for people who missed it. Behind the News -- The administration had defended the penalty -- an increase on future premiums -- as a stick to encourage people to sign up for the program, which subsidizes drug coverage. But the senators, uneasy about upsetting the electorate in an election year, said the program was difficult to understand. Waiving the fee would cost an estimated $1.7 billion over five years. RHODE ISLAND The News -- A judge in Rhode Island sentenced the onetime reality TV star Richard Hatch to 51 months in prison for tax evasion. Behind the News -- The sentence was at least 10 months longer than expected, and the judge said he opted for the longer term because it was clear to him that Mr. Hatch had lied during the trial. Mr. Hatch denied that he had been less than truthful, but fans of reality television could believe the judge's comments, given that Mr. Hatch connived his way to winning the CBS reality show ''Survivor'' in 2000. TEXAS The News -- The Texas Department of Transportation said it would consider raising the speed limit to 80 miles per hour on parts of two Interstate highways. Behind the News -- By making the proposal, the department seemed to thumb its nose at those who argue that Americans need to conserve gasoline. And traffic safety experts said that raising the limit would make the highways, in rural parts of West Texas, less safe. But officials said that if they raised the limit, they would just be acknowledging the obvious: that motorists drive that fast already."

And, of course, ABC was first among 18-to-49-year-olds for the night, delivering a demographic rating that also equaled more than the sum of every other network's ratings for that age group. CBS's all-rerun lineup placed second in total viewers (third in adults 18 to 49), while NBC's schedule was No. 3 in total viewers (and second among the 18-to-49 demographic).

The services are part of a broad new strategy to sell wireless media products directly to consumers. [C1.] In what is the boldest venture yet by an established media company to insinuate itself into millions of cellphones, the News Corporation has created a mobile entertainment store called Mobizzo and a production studio to focus exclusively on developing cellphone entertainment in much the same way that 20th Century Fox creates movies and television. [Page C1.] Before Harvard President's Ouster, an Influential Article Two years ago, when David McClintick, left, agreed to write an exposé on Harvard's effort on behalf of the United States government to help Russia privatize its economy in the 1990's, he had little inkling the article would play a part in forcing the ouster of Harvard's president, Lawrence Summers. ''How Harvard Lost Russia'' was published in the January issue of Institutional Investor magazine, a subscription-only publication, about a month and a half before Dr. Summers's resignation, which he announced last Tuesday. The move came just two weeks after a heated Feb. 7 meeting at which Dr. Summers was challenged on several issues, including his reaction to the events described in Mr. McClintick's provocative article. [C3.] Working to Make Computer Power More Portable When Samsung decided to mount a serious challenge to Apple Computer's iPod music player early last year, it turned to a Silicon Valley start-up and a small team of programmers led by Paul Mercer, 38, a veteran Apple Macintosh software designer. For Mr. Mercer, the Samsung project is the culmination of more than two decades of focus on extending personal computer technologies into the realm of portable devices. [C1.] Tense Ties Between White House and Press By its nature, the relationship between the White House and the press has historically held an inherent tension. And many say the relationship has been eroding since the Vietnam War and Watergate, when reporters had reason to distrust most everything the White House said and made a scandalous ''gate'' out of every murky act. But today, those on both sides say, the relationship has deteriorated further, exacerbated by live White House briefings. [C1.] Gauging the Marketing Magnetism of the Oscars Since the nominations for the 78th annual Academy Awards were announced, sponsors have shrugged off skeptics who questioned whether the ceremony, to be broadcast on Sunday by ABC, would draw a sizable audience. None of the five nominees for best picture are box-office blockbusters, the skeptics point out, and few of the nominees for acting awards are household names. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C4.] If you drill down into this year's best picture nominees, you will find that they are guerrilla insurgencies backed by superpowers. David Carr. [C1.] Web Companies Turn to 'Pay-Per-Call' Services Businesses like Ingenio, based in San Francisco, are helping Internet companies move into ''pay-per-call'' services, where consumers on the Web click on an icon to have someone call them or simply dial a number in an ad. Judson Brady, left, the owner of Broad Street Flowers, an Atlanta-based floral service, pays Ingenio around $4.15 for each call from a prospect -- most of whom see his ads on AOL, which introduced its pay-per-call service last year. More than a third of the callers place an order, Mr. Brady said, making it more effective than his ''pay-per-click'' advertising. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report.

The office of the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, issued a statement saying that the raid violated the truce. 1 Despite the cease-fire agreement, Israel intends to do its best to keep Iran and Syria from rearming Hezbollah and to kill the militia's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, a senior Israeli commander said. 6 As leaders in world capitals review United Nations plans for a peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, they are weighing whether the stated goals are clear and achievable and whether the rules of engagement will allow them to protect their forces. 6 Plot Inquiry Focuses on Family While little is known about the strength of the British government's evidence against the suspects in the plot to down airplanes across the Atlantic, three members of one family, and the charity it established, are at the heart of the investigation. 1 A Dictatorship on Trial The trials of military and police officials in Argentina accused of human rights violations during the country's brutal military dictatorship 30 years ago have raised new evidence of torture, rape and murder and brought victims face to face with some of the men they accused of abuse. 3 Iran Shells Iraqi Kurdistan Artillery shells fired from Iran have landed in remote northern villages of Iraqi Kurdistan in recent days and have killed at least two civilians and wounded four others, a senior Kurdish official said.

A new episode of ''CSI: Miami'' (19.82 million), starring David Caruso, below, which featured what being shot in the eye might look like and was the most-watched show in prime time, was preceded by Week 2 of Jenna Elfman's sitcom ''Courting Alex.'' Since it followed a rerun of ''Two and a Half Men'' (15.29 million), which delivered a smaller audience than an original episode, ''Alex'' was down from its premiere (13.46 million, versus 14.9 million last week) but retained a good percentage of ''Men'' viewers. Fox was a strong second place for the night in total viewers and adults 18 to 49, with the strangely juxtaposed ''Skating With Celebrities'' (9.93 million) and ''24'' (13.76 million).

At 9 p.m. on Fox, an episode of ''Bones'' again lost a significant portion of ''Idol'' viewers, bringing in 12.61 million. Though the bantering procedural placed first among adults 18 to 49 for the hour, a rerun of CBS's ''Criminal Minds'' attracted a larger audience (13.28 million). The cable-news broadcast of the State of the Union address on Tuesday resulted in the usual pecking order: Fox News (6.46 million), CNN (2.22 million), MSNBC (707,000).

The Daily Telegraph of London called this show ''inspired, seemingly effortless and far too close for comfort,'' while The Independent declared it ''simultaneously depressing and elating.'' Chris Langham (above) and Peter Capaldi, who star, are supposedly improvising parts of their dialogue. But maybe they're just gleaning it from newspapers. 7 P.M.

In this new drama series for very young adults, a handsome young man (Penn Badgley, left) enters Bedford College, a fictional institution in New York City. He is immediately accepted into a prestigious sex seminar (taught by Matthew Modine), as is his older sister (Tiffany Dupont), whose affair with a professor may soon be exposed in the campus newspaper. The show borrows a device from ''Sex, Lies & Videotape,'' having the students use video cameras as confessionals, but that oldie ''The Harrad Experiment'' also comes to mind. Audra McDonald, as a faculty member, lends some intelligence to the proceedings. 6 P.M. (TCM) DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944). Hey, baby, you're cute: let's kill my husband and collect a big insurance settlement. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray star in what may be the ultimate film noir. Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder wrote the screenplay. 9 P.M. (13, 49) THE NEW MEDICINE -- Adelaide, the sneezy, sniffly character in ''Guys and Dolls,'' knew it half a century ago when she sang, ''A person can develop a cold.'' Stress can make you sick. But maybe meditation or just happy thoughts can heal. In this two-hour documentary, doctors look into the mind-body connection. The show's host is Dana Reeve (above), who died of lung cancer earlier this month after nine years of caring for her paralyzed husband, Christopher Reeve. 9 P.M.

The plot, in this case, seems to have been a one-man operation. This new documentary uses a little of everything -- interviews, eyewitness accounts, archival tape and re-enactments -- to examine the events of that day and Mr. Hinckley's stated purpose: to impress the actress Jodie Foster, then a student at Yale University. 8 P.M. (CBS) SURVIVOR: PANAMA -- EXILE ISLAND -- The two tribes merge. Sally, the 27-year-old social worker from Chicago, returns from Exile Island. Bruce, the 58-year-old karate and art teacher from Simi Valley, Calif., chips a tooth. 8 P.M. (TCM) FAHRENHEIT -- 451 (1967).

(Fox Movie Channel) THE ROSE -- (1979) Bette Midler, in her first major movie, plays a Janis Joplin-like character, a rock star who seems doomed to self-destruct with the help of drugs, alcohol, exhaustion and self-loathing.

But how will she explain to investigators why she knew there was trouble before the thing went down? 8 P.M. (11) SURVIVAL OF THE RICHEST -- Season finale. Talk about stacking the odds. This reality series pits seven young adults with a combined family worth of more than $3 billion against seven of ''society's most disadvantaged,'' as a press release put it, in tasks ranging from living richly at a racetrack to cleaning up the spectator stands after the event. In this last episode, the two remaining teams help remodel an after-school center in South Central Los Angeles and try to win a large cash prize by, um, proving that they are capable of living without their parents' money. 8 P.M.

For this network premiere, Mr. Black (above right, with Joey Gaydos Jr. as Zack), as host, reminisces about playing a flat-broke guitarist who fakes his way into a job at an uppity private school.

Drew Lachey and Nancy O'Dell are the hosts, and Carson Kressley of ''Queer Eye'' provides witty commentary as 51 young women compete in Baltimore. Last year's winner, Chelsea Cooley (above), was Miss North Carolina, an art-school student, aspiring fashion buyer, opponent of domestic violence and shag-dance champion whose career dream, she said, was to work for Ralph Lauren. 8 P.M.

The association said 405 challenges were reported last year and added that although they have fluctuated over the years, they have dropped by half since Banned Books Week was begun. Judith F. Krug, the director of the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom, said the decline might be attributable to better preparation by librarians to organize community support for books and to a shift in focus by would-be censors to online content. The organization said that the number of books actually removed from shelves had decreased to about 44 in 2005 from more than 200 in 1982. The most challenged book last year was Robie H. Harris's ''It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex and Sexual Health,'' a guide for middle school students. Others high on the list were J. D. Salinger's ''Catcher in the Rye,'' Judy Blume's ''Forever'' and Robert Cormier's ''Chocolate War.'' The 25th annual Banned Books Week is scheduled for Sept. 23 to Sept. 30. ''The purpose of Banned Books Week is to bring to everyone's attention that our First Amendment rights are fragile and that somebody out there will take them away from you if you're not careful,'' Ms. Krug said. Taylor Hicks Settles Lawsuit Taylor Hicks, the incumbent American Idol, has settled his lawsuit against a Nashville producer over rights to three songs Mr. Hicks wrote before becoming famous, The Associated Press reported.

Brooks & Dunn, Mr. Chesney, Mr. Paisley, Rascal Flatts and Mr. Urban will all compete for entertainer of the year. ABC will broadcast the awards ceremony live from the Gaylord Entertainment Center in Nashville on Nov. 6. Princeton Acquires Irish Theater Collection Princeton University has received a major Irish theater collection spanning 160 years, including an unpublished play by Sean O'Casey, the university announced yesterday. To be called the Milberg Irish Theater Collection, the trove includes more than 1,000 plays, photographs, playbills, above, and other materials dating to the mid-19th century, and includes works by Dion Boucicault and John Millington Synge as well as Samuel Beckett, Brian Friel, Martin McDonagh and Conor McPherson. In celebration of the opening of the collection, Princeton will hold a symposium from Oct. 13 to Oct. 15; the actors Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Rea and Fiona Shaw and the Tony Award-winning director Garry Hynes are scheduled to appear. The O'Casey play is ''The Cooing of the Doves,'' which was once thought to be lost. O'Casey said he incorporated the one-act work into the second act of his ''Plough and the Stars.'' The collection is a gift from Leonard L. Milberg, a 1953 alumnus, who earlier donated collections of modern American poetry Irish poetry in 1994 and American Jewish writing to the university in 2001. ''For Irish theater, I don't think there is anything else like this, especially outside of Ireland,'' he said of his latest gift. ''I know people may be interested in a lot of other things, but if it's Irish theater, they'll call Princeton.''

(MTV) TIARA GIRLS -- You know those beauty pageant contestants who manage to answer any interview question with a pledge to work for world peace? Some of them actually have help with those answers. This new reality series focuses on young women (like Megan, above, hellbent on becoming Miss Iowa) who devote much of their lives to the stressful, expensive quest for beauty-contest crowns. Some of them just like the attention. 8 P.M. (Fox) BONES -- Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel) heads for New Orleans to help identify victims of Hurricane Katrina. But she wakes up there one morning, beaten, with no memory of the day before, and suspected of murdering the local medical examiner. Voodoo may have been involved. 8 P.M. (9) AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL -- A restaurant hostess, an interpreter, a saleswoman, a baby sitter and three students are still in the running for the latest round of this reality-competition series. Tonight someone has surgery, and Janice Dickinson makes a special appearance. 8 P.M. (TCM) THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST -- (1952) Michael Redgrave, Joan Greenwood (right, with Redgrave), Edith Evans and Margaret Rutherford take on Oscar Wilde's witty-for-the-sake-of-wit 1895 play about a deceptive bachelor, his best friend, two lovely young ladies and an absent-minded governess. 8 P.M. (13, 49) SHOW CATS -- Christopher Guest could have made this one-hour special as a companion to his film ''Best in Show'' (which was about dogs). Eccentric owners show off their animals and take them to a major cat show in Houston. 9 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- Rod Stewart performs. Then one of the seven remaining finalists is sent home. 9 P.M.

Richard of England, soon to be known as Richard the Lionheart, fights to keep it for the Christians. In this two-hour re-enactmentstyle documentary, both men emerge from the Crusades with glowing reputations. 10 P.M.

''John Wayne was to Ford what David was to Michelangelo,'' the Ford biographer Joseph McBride once said. ''He was the ideal man, the masculine ideal.'' They'd met when Wayne (above left, with Ford, on the set of ''The Alamo'' in 1960) was a college student working as a prop man, and their friendship, forged over poker games in Ford's yacht, spanned 50 years and 14 films, three of them nominated for Oscars. This 90-minute documentary uses home movies, back-lot film footage and interviews to navigate one of Hollywood's most enduringly resonant relationships. 9 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- And then there were three. The results of the Elvis tribute are in, and one of the final four checks into the Heartbreak Hotel. 9 P.M. (CBS) CRIMINAL MINDS -- Season finale. They've got mail.

After which Natalie won't let Owen stay with her, Lee just says no to both gambling and women, and Richard hires the virginal Zoe to be the school newspaper's new sex columnist. The episode is directed by the Oscar-winning documentarian Barbara Kopple, whose history with Tom Fontana, the show's creator, goes back to ''Oz'' and ''Homicide.'' 9 P.M.

It also had lows. Simon Cowell, below, said to a male contestant, Kenneth (Chase) Bush, ''It's going to sound odd, but I almost imagine you in a dress when you sing.'' After Mr. Bush assured the judges he wasn't interested in doing drag, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul outvoted Mr. Cowell and sent Mr. Bush to the next round. The two-hour episode drew 34.75 million viewers for Fox in Nielsen's estimates. The broadcast was the talent show's third-highest-rated ever, and delivered an overwhelming victory for the network. In its second week of the season, ''Idol'' is taking a toll on its network competition between 8 and 10 p.m. ABC's ''According to Jim'' (6.01 million), ''Rodney'' (5.6 million) and ''Commander in Chief'' (10.33 million) all suffered blows to their ratings, as did NBC's ''Fear Factor'' (4.69 million) and two episodes of ''Scrubs'' (5.47 million), then (5.73 million). CBS placed a far-off second for the night. Its new midseason series ''Love Monkey'' fared poorly in Week 2, attracting only 7.65 million viewers. KATE AURTHUR"

But the long, frustrating wait is over. A new 12-episode season begins Sunday night (HBO at 9), with Tony Soprano (JAMES GANDOLFINI) dealing with mob-boss problems like tensions between the New York and New Jersey crime families and realizing that his children aren't children anymore. FRANKIE VALLI is tonight's returning guest star. BEN KINGSLEY will turn up later in the season. And this is not the end: eight more episodes are planned for 2007. There is absolutely no such thing as a ''Seinfeld'' curse. The majority of all new series flop, so the failure of sitcoms with Michael Richards, Jason Alexander and JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS doesn't mean much. Still, the premiere of ''THE NEW ADVENTURES OF OLD CHRISTINE'' (Monday at 9:30 p.m. on CBS), starring Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, makes some of us nervous. She plays a divorced mom (as if her old character, Elaine, had a maternal bone in her body) and gym owner. The first episode is all about enrolling her 8-year-old son (TREVOR GAGNON) in a private school (''Where are the black people?'' he asks) and establishing her relationship with her ex-husband (CLARK GREGG), who has a new girlfriend (EMILY RUTHERFORD), also named Christine. Thus the title. SEBASTIAN TELFAIR, a young basketball player from Coney Island, is such a star that on the first day of his senior year in high school he holds a press conference. And no one thinks that's unusual. The documentary ''THROUGH THE FIRE'' (Sunday night at 8 on ESPN), which has a lot in common with Steve James's ''Hoop Dreams'' (1994), sees him through graduation, his choice between going to college and a pro career, and the point of it all: getting himself and his family out of the projects."

''Idol'' ended on a cruel note: after a young man named Zachary Travis, who had a high voice and high heels, sang Whitney Houston's ''Queen of the Night,'' Simon Cowell called the performance ''atrocious'' and ''confused.'' As Mr. Travis cried to his family afterward, the show itself piled on, playing the theme song from ''The Crying Game,'' the 1992 movie that featured a transgendered character. Regardless, the show delivered its largest audience, 31.44 million, for a Wednesday edition since the finale of the second season, when Clay Aiken lost to Ruben Studdard. ''Idol'' helped lift the premiere of ''Skating With Celebrities,'' which drew 18.73 million viewers. On ABC, ''Lost'' filled in the marital discord part of the past of Jack (Matthew Fox) in flashbacks and ended back on the island with him asking Ana (Michelle Rodriguez, left) for advice on how to train an army to fight the evil Others. ''Lost'' was ABC's sole winner of the night, with 19.3 million viewers; the network placed second to Fox in adults 18 to 49, and third among total viewers, behind CBS. KATE AURTHUR"

The telling trio: Stanley Milgram's obedience-to-authority experiments in which subjects willingly inflict pain on another person; Philip Zimbardo's prisoner-and-guard role-play study, and the 1969 experiment at Columbia University that showed how being in a group can cause humans to behave like animals. 10:30 P.M.

Now the networks' May finales have arrived in one large heap: the density is almost insulting after such long patches of tiresome reruns. But we must persevere. So among the season finales this week are two of the ''CSI'' franchises (''NEW YORK,'' CBS, Wednesday at 10 p.m., and the Las Vegas flagship, Thursday at 9 p.m.). All three ''LAW & ORDER'' shows also conclude: On ''SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT'' (NBC, Tuesday at 10 p.m.) a famous man's condemnation of prescription drugs will lead a young fan (BRITTANY SNOW) to jettison her meds and go loony. And on the ''Law & Order'' mother ship (Wednesday at 10 p.m.) the audience will see why one of the main characters will not be returning next season. This year ''GREY'S ANATOMY'' inherited the space in the popular consciousness formerly occupied by ''FRIENDS.'' On Sunday (ABC, 10 p.m.) and Monday (9 p.m. to 11) that hospital soap opera will conclude its second season: the search for a new heart for Denny (JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN) will become critical, and surgeons with awkward relationships -- which is everyone -- will be forced to work closely together. Meanwhile a slew of veteran series will adjourn forever this week. ''THAT 70'S SHOW'' (Fox, Thursday at 8 p.m.) will finally ring in 1980, after eight seasons, and in a cloud of pot smoke.

An audience of 31.48 million tuned in, and of the 18-to-49-year-olds who watched television between 8 and 9 p.m., 32 percent chose ''Idol.'' Those ratings continued the talent competition's streak of double-digit growth in comparison with last year's telecasts. Fox's ''House'' also won its hour in dominant fashion, with 21.51 million viewers at 9 p.m. In that slot, the CBS action series ''The Unit'' brought in 15.9 million viewers, placing second to ''House''; it is this season's most-watched new show so far. Also of note, the good news for NBC was that its new sitcom, ''Teachers,'' drew 6.7 million viewers and retained most of the ''Scrubs'' audience (6.8 million).

But most shows are not ''American Idol.'' On Wednesday at 9 p.m., the first results show of its final round drew an audience of 27.84 million in Nielsen's estimates, giving Fox an easy victory. The series premiere of ''The Loop'' followed, and, as often happens with shows after ''Idol,'' half the audience was lost: 13.75 million tuned in. Earlier in the night, Fox's ''Bones'' delivered 12.13 million viewers. In recent weeks, the network has given that crime series a post-''Idol'' berth to boost its audience, and has now moved the show to 8 p.m. The strategy appears to have worked: ''Bones'' tied for first for the hour among adults 18 to 49, and placed second in the time slot to CBS's ''Survivor'' recap (12.69 million) in total viewers. ABC's combination of piggybacking ''Lost'' and ''Invasion'' has been less successful. Wednesday's episode of ''Lost'' (7.14 million) at 9 p.m. was a low-rated repeat, causing the creeping aliens of ''Invasion'' to tank at 10 p.m., with 7.23 million. KATE AURTHUR"

(BBC America) QUEEN AND COUNTRY -- On June 15, Britain will celebrate the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II (along with the 85th birthday of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh). This four-hour special examines the key aspects of the reign of one of the world's most photographed personalities, who, even now, remains an enigma to her people. At 7, ''H.M. the Queen: A Remarkable Life'' looks at how the queen (above, shown arriving at Westminster Abbey on May 17) has weathered change during more than 50 years on the throne. 8 P.M. (CBS) THE 60TH ANNUAL TONY AWARDS -- She may not have earned a Tony nomination, but her star turn in ''Three Days of Rain'' was a major factor in the 4.1 percent boost in ticket sales this year, according to the League of American Theaters and Producers. We're sure she'll rake in more than a few viewers in her role as a presenter at this, the least glitzy (and most scantily watched) of all major award ceremonies, broadcast live from Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. 9 P.M.

That was the impact of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia, whose explosion could be heard 3,000 miles away in Australia. This computergenerated special is almost, but thankfully not quite, like being there. 9 P.M.

And some scheduling moves have worked brilliantly, like ABC's shift of ''Grey's Anatomy,'' now television's hottest show'' to Thursday night. But on the down side for the networks, several new shows have already been dropped from schedules and many new series have wasted huge audiences from the hit shows that preceded them.

As the studios begin to shrink their slates and make fewer movies, they are increasing their reliance on the big, expensive extravaganzas. Sometimes they succeed, as ''Batman Begins'' and the ''Harry Potter'' movies have for Warner. But the lackluster results for Warner's blockbusters this summer show that the large tentpole features are not sure things, after all. And when they fail, they put more pressure on smaller films to open big.

Three of the group's albums were available beginning yesterday, each with two bonus tracks and a third iTunes exclusive cut. In addition, iTunes is selling the video content featured on the group's ''Live in Texas'' and ''Collision Course'' DVD's. ''We were really excited when iTunes told us that we were one of their most requested acts,'' Mike Shinoda, a member of the group, said. ''We will never ignore our fans, and the timing seemed right to make our music available, with some special additions.'' Warning on Streisand Concert Tickets More than 1,000 tickets for the first United States concert tour of Barbra Streisand, below, in more than a decade have been invalidated because they were bought with stolen credit card information, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Organizers announced that the tickets, bought through Ticketmaster, turned up on various Internet resale sites. With tickets priced at $100 to $750, the 19-performance tour is to begin in Philadelphia on Oct. 4. (Performances in Madison Square Garden are scheduled for Oct. 9 and 11.) The national promoter, Michael Cohl, and Ms. Streisand's manager, Martin Erlichman, warned that no one holding the invalidated tickets would be admitted. Jessica Simpson's Lost Cord If timing is everything, then Jessica Simpson got nothing much yesterday. Nothing much, that is, besides a case of laryngitis. Just as she was about to begin promoting her new album, ''A Public Affair'' (Epic), she lost her voice, The Associated Press reported. ''She has been ordered to rest,'' said Rob Shuter, her press representative. ''She can talk; she can croak out a few sentences. She sounds a little off, but, you know, she can't sing.'' He said Miss Simpson, 26, became ill on Friday and has ''a strain, a bruise on her vocal cord.'' On Second Thought The rapper Foxy Brown, below, pleaded guilty and then pleaded for reconsideration when she appeared in Criminal Court in Manhattan on Monday to answer to misdemeanor assault charges, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Brown, 26, whose real name is Inga Marchand, was accused of kicking an employee of a salon and smacking a second in an argument over a payment for a manicure. When she appeared in court on Monday, she was spared jail time but, under a plea deal with the Manhattan district attorney's office, accepted three years' probation and agreed to attend anger management classes. Minutes later, she tried to return to the courtroom and withdraw her plea, contending that she had been rushed into her decision, said Edison Alban, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. He said the judge told her that ''the plea stands.'' Emmys Nip 'Pirates' The Emmy Awards might have provided joy aplenty for winners including Kiefer Sutherland and ''The Office,'' as well as the host, Conan O'Brien, but Sunday night's ceremonies were only so-so for NBC, The Associated Press reported. According to estimates from Nielsen Media Research, the show attracted its fourth-smallest audience ever, averaging 16.1 million viewers, down from 18.8 million last year, when CBS broadcast the awards in September. Nevertheless, NBC won the night's ratings race. The Emmys, seen from 8 to 11 p.m., beat strong competition in the form of ABC's broadcast of ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' from 7 to 10 p.m. It averaged 10.2 million viewers. The Disney Channel has a new hit on its hands: ''The Cheetah Girls 2,'' seen on Friday from 8 to 9:55 p.m., drew an average of 7.8 million views, the most for an original movie debut in the channel's history."

Harrison Ford, no slouch in the seduction department, bestows the honors. 8 P.M. (CBS) BIG BROTHER 7: ALL-STARS -- Historically, democracy has been riddled with subterfuge, deception and treason.

In this documentary, Martin Scorsese, Peter Falk, Edward Burns, Spike Lee, Henry Jaglom, Arthur Penn (above, with Faye Dunaway on the set of ''Bonnie and Clyde''), Gena Rowlands and John Sayles talk about the struggles -- creative, financial and emotional -- of being a maverick in Hollywood and the extraordinary vision that can result from it. 9 P.M.

Kean Jr., the Republican challenger for United States Senate in New Jersey, has capitalized on his father's reputation to offset voters' qualms about his inexperience. Senator Robert Menendez has been buoyed by discontent with President Bush. The result in this heavily Democratic state is an extremely tight race, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. The poll suggests that Mr. Kean, a state senator, has done surprisingly well in a year when other Republicans are struggling even on friendlier turf not because of Mr. Kean himself, but because of his father, former Gov.

And then there's the OLYMPICS, which start on Friday (NBC, 8 p.m.): unfortunately, BJORK will not be adding an element of arty weirdness to the opening ceremonies, as she did in Athens 2004. But there are sadder things to discuss than a Bjork-less Olympics.

But do not go gentle into that good Friday night at 8 p.m., Mitchell Hurwitz; rage, rage, for the chance to continue the show you created. All hope is not lost: SHOWTIME has publicly been courting the show in the hope that it can bring the Bluth family's selfish, alcoholic charms to the pay-cable channel. Guest stars abound in the final four episodes. In one, WILLIAM HUNG, the dreadful ''American Idol'' contestant, appears as himself, and JUDGE REINHOLD, solely on the strength of his first name, has been given a courtroom show -- on which Michael (JASON BATEMAN) defends the Bluths in a mock trial. In an episode called ''FAMILY TIES,'' JUSTINE BATEMAN -- Jason's sister, who made her name in that bygone sitcom -- plays Michael's long-lost sister. ''I've always been mildly attracted to you,'' she tells him. This two-hour block of the Fox series will be broadcast opposite the Olympics kickoff. In other words, it will go out as it came in: as roadkill."

But some critics say that the solution -- a deal that gives more than a third of Arcelor to a Russian billionaire, Aleksei Mordashov, left, may leave a bitter aftertaste. If it is approved by the shareholders, the agreement will put Russian executives in crucial management positions at Arcelor, raising questions about integration between the two corporate cultures, and concerns among some shareholders about what role the Russian government may want to play. [C3.] HISPANIC CALLERS -- Now that nearly three out of four people in this country have mobile phone service, cellphone companies are chasing new customers by marketing to ever more specific slices of the population. But one group is getting extra attention: Hispanics. And there is ample reason for the carriers' attention. One of the country's fastest growing demographic groups, Hispanics often have large families that span international borders, making for larger phone bills. [C1.] THAT 60'S SHOW -- AMC cable television network is considering a series that would explore how Madison Avenue remakes itself to meet the changing needs of clients as consumers and the media undergo transformation. So the show would be a reality series, right? Not exactly. It is fictional, a drama about the advertising industry circa 1960. In another example of how the more things change the more they remain the same, if AMC decides to pick up the series, each episode may be sponsored by a single advertiser -- just as was done in 1960. Stuart Elliott, Advertising. [C7.] A SUMMER OF HIGH GAS PRICES -- As the summer travel season began in earnest this past weekend, Americans were indulging their wanderlust, jamming highways, and filling airports, motels and eateries. But in some small ways, with possibly large consequences for the health of the economy, travelers interviewed across the country over the weekend said they were cutting their spending and downsizing their plans for summer trips. [A1.] A MOVE IN EUROPE -- When BAE Systems, the British military contractor, announced that it was bowing out of its nearly 30-year relationship with Airbus, the split was greeted in Britain with shock at first, followed by recognition that the companies had grown apart. BAE's departure now could be transformational not only for it, but also for Airbus, whose ownership -- and decision-making -- structure is evolving. [C4.] BRIGHT SPOT FOR G.M. -- Four years ago, Daewoo Motor was the biggest and ugliest addition to South Korea's junkyard of bankrupt companies. Its parent conglomerate had collapsed, and most potential investors were intimidated by its militant labor union. Its founder, Kim Woo Choong, left, is on trial on corruption charges linked to the disintegration of his conglomerate in 1998. But Mr. Kim is gone, and Daewoo has become a bright spot for G.M. [C4.] AIRLINE APOLOGIZES -- WestJet Airlines agreed on Monday to pay 15.5 million Canadian dollars ($14 million) to settle accusations of spying on an internal Web site of its rival, Air Canada. The settlement, which came with an apology, brought to an end two years of litigation. [C9.] THE OPEC MEETING -- Most delegates at this week's meeting of OPEC are expected to nod politely to Venezuela's calls for output cuts that could drive prices even higher, while doing the opposite by reaping all they can from the current bonanza of high prices. The oil minister of the United Arab Emirates rejected talk of a possible cut in the cartel's output quotas of 28 million barrels a day. [C1.] A SOFTWARE BATTLE IN CHINA -- Responding to years of intensive international lobbying, the Chinese government has introduced measures offering the potential to curb widespread piracy and increase revenue for software companies. The Business Software Alliance estimates that more than 90 percent of the software in China is unlicensed. [C3.] A NEW TAX COMPLAINT -- In an effort to raise revenues, tax writers in Congress added a last-minute provision that increased taxes for Americans living abroad. But the sudden imposition of taxes has surprised overseas taxpayers, and it has employers concerned about the added cost. [C3.] PAYING WITH ATTENTION -- With the cost of mobile phone calls already dropping sharply, Virgin Mobile USA plans to announce a way that people can talk for no money at all. They will, however, have to pay with a chunk of their attention. [C4.] FROG POWER -- A tribal cure in Brazil, derived from the secretions of a poisonous tree frog, raises hope of a wonder drug that might benefit the country's indigenous people as well as its drug industry [C1.] GLOBAL SECURITY -- In an increasingly global economy, more business travelers find themselves visiting places that, if not as obviously dangerous as Baghdad or Kabul, are unfamiliar and possibly treacherous. And a number of risk management and security firms are providing services to help them, and say their business is growing. [C8.]"

But a devoted, growing viewership long ago overcame the criticism. And still, somehow, the state of the draft expert Mel Kiper Jr.'s pompadour remains relevant. ''If any event typifies how far we've come as a company, it's the N.F.L. draft,'' John Wildhack, an ESPN senior vice president, said earlier this week."

All this has made the area particularly attractive to deep-pocketed developers of residential projects, like Rockrose and AvalonBay, and they and other builders have a number of projects under way to house people who cannot afford Manhattan prices or decline to pay them. As a result, the prospective influx of people to what had been an industrial area seems likely to attract retailers and other service companies. But will office developers and business tenants be attracted to what has long been designated as New York City's fourth central business district, after Midtown, downtown Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn?"

On Saturday, faced with better-known and certainly higher-paid analysts at ESPN during the National Football League draft, Mayock, the NFL Network's draft guru, lapped them all. A former Giants defensive back and college football analyst for ABC, CBS, ESPN and Fox Sports Net, Mayock used superior insight to catapult himself beyond any voice at ESPN, which has carried the draft for 26 years."

For one thing, between the first pitch and the pilot episode, the show's main character, Tom Farrell, underwent a career change, and that gave the series a whole different defining element: music. Michael Rauch, the show's creator, said that the series was inspired by Kyle Smith's novel about the dating foibles of a New York thirtysomething and that its protagonist initially was, as in the book, a tabloid journalist. Somewhere along the line, though, somebody suggested that a different career would make for livelier television, and Farrell became a record industry A&R scout -- for ''artist and repertory,'' the guy who looks in clubs and concert halls for music's next big thing. Mr. Rauch said that, having spent a lot of time with a friend who was in the music business, he had no trouble seeing the possibilities."

His lawyer, Michael Mimms, said Mr. Hatch, 45, asked to be placed in protective custody at a jail in Plymouth, Mass., and Charles Wyant, a deputy United States marshal, said the request had been granted because Mr. Hatch is a celebrity. ''The situation he's in is the best possible position for him to be in at this point in time, the safest and most secure,'' Mr. Wyant said. Mr. Hatch was put in custody immediately after he was found guilty of tax evasion because Federal District Court Judge Ernest Torres said he posed a flight risk. Indonesian Muslims Protest Playboy Hurling stones, shattering windows and tearing up magazines, hundreds of Muslims attacked the offices of Playboy in Jakarta, Indonesia, yesterday after the magazine was published in the country for the first time, Agence France-Presse reported. About 300 members of the Islamic Defenders' Front massed outside the building to demand that the local version of Playboy, which does not publish nude photographs, cease publication. One of approximately 90 police officers guarding the building was injured, but most of the magazine's employees had left when the demonstration took place. Salim Al Hamid, a leader of the group, told Radio Elshinta, ''We will carry out more attacks if Playboy refuses to stop publishing.'' The Indonesian edition of the magazine was quickly sold out when it appeared on Friday, and copies later changed hands at more than three times the cover price, $4.33. It features pictures of women in underwear but is regarded as no racier than Indonesian editions of the men's magazines FHM and Maxim. Muslims make up about 88 percent of Indonesia's population of 220 million. Crime Takes a Holiday It's Easter in Norway, and crime is booming. As Norwegians rush off to their mountain cabins for a final feast of skiing before the snow melts, they take with them a supply of mysteries, Reuters reported, and in keeping with a tradition known as Easter Crime, television and radio stations schedule thrillers back to back. ''People sit inside their cabins, watch crime on television and then read crime books at night,'' said Ane Farsethaas, a book reviewer. ''It's a very Norwegian thing to do.'' The bookshop chain Tanum estimates that sales of crime books soar about 500 percent in the week leading to Easter, and this week, its top 10 best-sellers are all crime novels, led by the Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's ''Men Who Hate Women.'' No one seems to know how the Easter Crime tradition began, although the ancient Norsemen who returned from raids on the British Isles were fond of settling down with flasks of mead and recounting tales of murder and pillage to their women and children. Footnotes The bad-boy rocker Pete Doherty didn't keep his date to appear in a London court yesterday for a review of his progress in drug rehabilitation, The Associated Press reported. Told that he had been unable to return from Paris after a performance by his group, Babyshambles, Thames Magistrates' Court adjourned the case until May 12. He is to appear in the same court in a separate drug case next Thursday. The Australian pop star Kylie Minogue, below, has been invited to headline the 2007 Glastonbury Festival, a highlight of the British summer music calendar, The Associated Press reported. In London for the premiere of ''Glastonbury,'' a documentary about the festival's 35 years, Michael Eavis, a working farmer who stages the event in his fields, said: ''Kylie is coming back, hopefully. Her people are quite confident; she wants to do it.'' Last year, she canceled her performance after learning she had breast cancer. No festival will be held this year, to allow Mr. Eavis's cows to graze without interruption. A film school named for the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa (''Rashomon,'' ''The Seven Samurai,'' ''Yojimbo'') has been established in Tokyo by his son, Hisao Kurosawa, and an associate, Tatsuya Nakadai, an actor long linked with the filmmaker, The Associated Press reported. Beginning in September, the two-year school will hold classes for 30 aspiring actors and 80 students of production. The perennial question of the authorship William Shakespeare's plays will be explored once more in an exhibition beginning in November at Shakespeare's Globe Theater in London. The roundup of suspects like Francis Bacon, Edward de Vere and Henry Neville will include an examination of their lives, schooling, careers and opportunities and a look at what some see as clues hidden within the plays."

American officials cautioned that they had not yet received any confirmation that the test had occurred. A1 The North Korea nuclear test amounted to a major failure for China, which mounted one of its most extensive diplomatic efforts in years to find a negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis. The Chinese expressed their anger in unusually strong terms, saying the test was ''flagrant and brazen.'' A6 Tsunami Project Stalled Construction of a road in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, meant as a good-will gesture from the American people to the survivors of the 2004 tsunami, has met with difficulty. Because of long negotiations to acquire right of way through residential and farm land, and through several hundred graves of religious significance, the project has not even started. A8 Hints at Need for Iraq Change James A. Baker III, the Republican co-chairman of a panel reassessing Iraq strategy for President Bush, said he expected that the panel would depart from Mr. Bush's repeated calls to ''stay the course,'' and he strongly suggested that the White House enter direct talks with countries it has so far kept at arms length, including Iran and Syria. A1 American and Iraqi troops fought a fierce battle with militants in the city of Diwaniya, a stronghold of militia members loyal to radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, the American military said. The skirmish was the third serious clash between American or Iraqi soldiers against members of the Mahdi Army in Diwaniya in less than two months. A8 Japan and China Mend Fences China and Japan said they had made progress addressing their historical animosities and territorial differences as Shinzo Abe, the new Japanese prime minister, made his first trip to mend ties with Asian neighbors. President Hu Jintao of China, left, called Mr. Abe's visit a turning point for two Asian powers whose relations had sharply declined. A3 Iran Opposition Cleric Seized Ayatollah Mohammad Kazemeni Boroujerdi, a senior cleric who opposes clerical rule of Iran, was arrested after clashes with Iranian police officers, news agencies reported. The reports quoted officials as saying that some of the cleric's supporters were armed with knives and daggers and that the police used tear gas to disperse them. A3 Transponder Not Recalled The electronic device for broadcasting a plane's identity and altitude carried by the business jet that apparently collided with a Boeing 737 over the Amazon was not one of the potentially faulty ones ordered repaired by American safety officials, the manufacturer said. A9 NATIONAL A10-15 Religious Employers Enjoy Legal Shield From Lawsuits Legislators, judges and regulators have carved out or preserved safe havens that shield religious employers of all faiths from most employee lawsuits, from laws protecting pensions and providing unemployment benefits, and from laws that give employees the right to form unions to negotiate with their employers. A1 Virginia Republicans Resolute In dozens of interviews in southeastern Virginia, a swing state in tight races for the House and Senate, many conservative Christians said that rather than discourage them from going to the polls, the scandal surrounding Representative Mark Foley only reinforced their reasons to vote for their Republican incumbents. A1 For all the contradictions and inconsistencies in the tale of Mark Foley, the investigation into how Republicans handled concerns about his conduct may hinge on what transpired in a private meeting that was convened in his office last year. A12 Races Hinge on Local Economy Michigan's political races for governor and the Senate are hinging nearly entirely on the struggling economy and the question of who is to blame for it. And in other Rust Belt states, including Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, economic worries are playing a similar role, if a far more subtle one. A10 Lawyer's Book Causes Trouble Joyce Dudley, a deputy district attorney in Santa Barbara, published a crime novel. The novel concerns a rape case with echoes of a real one. An appeals court in Ventura, Calif., ruled that Ms. Dudley's novel had crossed an ethical line, and removed her from the case. A10 Fight Over National Park Hunt Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, is fighting to preserve an agreement by the National Park Service to close 45,000 acres of parkland on Santa Rosa Island, Calif., to the public for hunting, August through December. A15 Lettuce Recalled for E. Coli Less than a week after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its warning on fresh spinach grown in the Salinas Valley, a popular brand of lettuce grown there was recalled over concerns about E. coli contamination. The lettuce does not appear to have caused any illnesses, the president of the grower said. A10 Senator's Finances Questioned For the past five years, Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia, has failed to tell Congress about stock options he received for his work as a director of a high-tech company. Congressional rules require senators to disclose all deferred compensation, like stock options. A13 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Despite Criticism at Home, Giuliani Retains Support Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, is scheduled to make his first public appearance in two years in New Hampshire. Yet as Mr. Giuliani traverses the country, polls show he has emerged as a leading candidate for the Republican presidential primaries -- largely because of how he guided a wounded city in the weeks after 9/11. B1 Cluster of Sex Offenders A house where four sex offenders lived together as roommates has caused an uproar in Suffolk County, where one Suffolk County lawmaker has called for legislation to prevent groups of registered sex offenders from living together. B1 A Mall of Knockoffs In the last two years, the city has seized close to $50 million in counterfeit goods from the city's top haven for knockoff and phony goods, and shut down 15 buildings that it claimed were once occupied almost entirely by counterfeiters, but thousands of people still pack the area on weekends. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-10 Steinbrenner Silent on Torre George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, is fuming over the team's first-round elimination by the Detroit Tigers. He issued a blistering statement through his publicist but took no action on Joe Torre, his manager for the last 11 seasons.

D9 ARTS E1-10 Unlikely Success at Book Fair A book by the American author Jonathan Littell, ''Les Bienveillantes,'' has taken the Frankfurt fair, the world's largest booksellers' convention, by storm.

Mrs. Doogan, 74, a fairly reliable Republican in a town where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats, had just been asked about the United States Senate race in which New Jersey voters have been bombarded with vitriolic television commercials.

Back in Washington, Senator John McCain of Arizona moved to set up his own presidential exploratory committee and prepared what aides promised would be two major speeches this Thursday about 2008, based on last Tuesday's vote. And Hillary Rodham Clinton scored the election-week cover of New York magazine; the subject was not her easy return to the Senate. In some ways, the midterm election of 2006 was the first big event of the 2008 race -- much like an early debate or an Iowa straw poll. It helped shake out and shake up the field. Some lessons were instantly apparent: you probably won't hear more talk of Republican candidates wrestling for the mantle of President Bush, and Democrats are looking hungrily at Ohio and Colorado, states that went Republican in 2004 and 2000. Here are some of the less obvious consequences for 2008, courtesy of 2006. The Swing-Vote Math The White House won in 2002 and 2004 with a simple strategy pressed by Karl Rove: use hot-button issues and sophisticated organizational tools to turn out voters from the Republican base, calculating that there are enough of them to win. Well, maybe not. Swing independent voters -- 26 percent of the electorate this year -- voted 2-to-1 for Democrats last Tuesday, a big reason the Democrats will control the House next year."

Proof, 32, a member of the group D12 whose legal name was Deshaun Holton, was shot to death on April 11 after a fight at an after-hours club in Detroit. The authorities said that Proof shot Keith Bender Jr., 35, who later died, and was in turn shot by Mr. Bender's cousin, Mario Etheridge, who has been charged with gun violations. Among the mourners who filled the Fellowship Chapel to overflowing were the rap stars Dr. Dre, 50 Cent and Xzibit. In a long eulogy during the nearly three-hour service, the Rev. Wendell Anthony called violence ''the madness that is infecting Detroit'' and said, ''It's time for us to stop shedding needless blood.'' The Detroit rapper Obie Trice, who has a bullet from a New Year's Eve shooting lodged in his skull, said tearfully: ''I want to talk to the black men in here that's coming up in the hood, coming up in the struggle. We're killing each other, dawg. And it's about nothing. Nothing. Nothing. We're all dying. And we're leaving our kids. Our mamas. Our grandmas. Over nothing.'' Playboy Far and Near The Indonesian edition of Playboy, a target of violent demonstrations by Islamic militants, has suspended operations, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday. Its editor, Erwin Arnada, said: ''For the time being, we are prioritizing security. We have vacated our office, and we have halted our operational activities.'' Baylor University in Waco, Tex., the self-described world's largest Baptist college, has threatened its female students with disciplinary action if they pose for Playboy, which is trying to recruit models there for a photo spread on women of the Big 12 athletic conference, Reuters reported. University officials said punishment could include suspension. Baylor did not permit dancing on campus until 10 years ago. Cannes Festival Competitors Announced Films by Pedro Almodóvar of Spain, below, Ken Loach of Britain, Nanni Moretti of Italy, Bruno Dumont of France, Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico and Aki Kaurismaki of Finland, as well as Sofia Coppola, Richard Kelly and Richard Linklater of the United States, will be among the 19 competitors for the grand prize at this year's Cannes International Film Festival, from May 17 to 28, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday.

Doherty in Court (Again) Pete Doherty, the British rock star and self-confessed cocaine addict, was sentenced yesterday in London to two years' probation and banned from driving for six months, but spared a jail term, Reuters reported. Mr. Doherty, 27, was ordered to enter an 18-month narcotics rehabilitation program. Magistrate Jane McIvor said, ''It's going to be a long and slow process, but you are showing significant signs of compliance and effort.'' Mr. Doherty is to appear in court on May 31. Sentencing of Richard Hatch, 45, who won $1 million in the inaugural ''Survivor'' competition on CBS, has been postponed to May 16 from Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. In January, he was found guilty of failing to pay taxes on his winnings and other income. He has since been in jail in Plymouth, Mass. Jagger in TV Comedy? Mick Jagger is in negotiations to play a role in an ABC comedy pilot about blue-collar New Yorkers who decide to rob a celebrity, Reuters reported. Mr. Jagger would portray the celebrity. His name has been mentioned in scenes that have already been filmed; if the series is picked up, he would continue to appear."

LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punchline. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) 'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JUMP/CUT' Neena Beber's play about an aspiring filmmaker's effort to document his best friend's illness limns despair while leaving the audience exhilarated -- by the fierce beauty of Beber's writing, and by a captivating performance by Luke Kirby as the brilliant, charismatic, darkly funny manic-depressive whose inescapable fate is the central mystery of the work (2:10). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Miriam Horn) * 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the archmanipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE' Satire sans teeth by Charles Grodin about internecine warfare within a Fifth Avenue co-op board. Directed by Chris Smith, the show has the embarrassed air of someone who has just been served a choice steak and misplaced his dentures (1:30). Primary Stages, at 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AVALON' Glory Sims Bowen's retelling of the Camelot legend from the women's point of view is entertaining but too long and uncertain in tone. The comic moments work better than the earnest ones (2:20). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Anita Gates) 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'THE BOOK OF THE DUN COW' An animal allegory about good and evil, this family musical by Randy Courts and Mark St. Germain is on the didactic side and could use more oomph. Providing some are an electric villain, Micah Bucey, and a warm-voiced mezzo, Carol Hickey. Still, a number of children at a recent performance seemed absorbed: they didn't squirm, they watched (2:15). West End Theater in the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens) * 'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'PARADISE' A mostly articulate drama about an inarticulate young man who may have found Mr. Right or the tipping point that leads him into madness (1:30). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, north of White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444.( Zinoman) 'REAL BLACK MEN DON'T SIT CROSS-LEGGED ON THE FLOOR' The poet and playwright Malik's series of quick, interwoven scenes tracing the lives of African-American men in America, mainly in the last half century, can pack an emotional punch, but it works better as a showcase for some outstanding performances by its eight-member cast than it does as a theater piece (2:00). New Federal Theater, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200. (Stevens) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian''comedienne'' is a Style book prohibition/lg Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212).868-4444. closing March 10 !(Phoebe Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100.(Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100.(Brantley) Last Chance 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by H.I.V. diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine-tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens) 'DESERT WIND' (No rating, 80 minutes, in French) In March 2004, the Swiss documentarist François Kohler took 13 men -- Canadian, French, Swiss and Belgian -- on a two-week trek in the Tunisian Sahara. The group was accompanied by a Swiss psychotherapist, as well as by a team of Tunisian guides with pack camels. The purpose of the trip: to stage a kind of men's encounter group in the desert, encouraging the participants to break away from received notions of masculinity and to talk about their desires, anxieties and deepest fears. Though it generates its share of unintentional giggles, ''Desert Wind'' does manage to take us to a seldom-visited place: the hidden corners of the straight male mind. (Stevens) 'FILM GEEK' (No rating, 78 minutes) Scotty Pelk (Malik Malkasian) is a diminutive, socially addled young man whose sole interest in life is the cinema. When he's fired from his job for, in essence, being too annoying, Scotty goes on a downward spiral, begging for work at every video store in town and obsessively courting a pretty film fan (Tyler Gannon) despite her increasingly humiliating rejection of him. Despite this semiautobiographical film's likable premise, Scotty Pelk, as written by James Westby and played by Mr. Malkasian, is actually so irritating, so genuinely hard to take, that like the rest of the characters in the movie, we soon find ourselves itching to get away from him. (Stevens) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'FIREWALL' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A thrill-challenged thriller starring Harrison Ford and directed by Richard Loncraine that manages to entertain mildly only because it traffics in all the familiar action-movie clichés, giving filmgoers ample opportunity to test their action-movie I.Q.'s. (Dargis) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee) 'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) 'PINK PANTHER' (PG, 92 minutes) Steve Martin steps into the shoes of Peter Sellers in this intermittently witty revival of a vintage comedy franchise. Though finely honed, Mr. Martin's portrayal of the idiotic French police inspector Jacques Clouseau can't match Sellers's viscerally funny one. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'THROUGH THE FIRE' (No rating, 103 minutes) Jonathan Hock's unwaveringly upbeat documentary follows the basketball sensation Sebastian Telfair, a senior at Lincoln High School on Coney Island, as he chooses between the University of Louisville and the N.B.A. Yet behind the cheering and popping flashbulbs lurks another, much darker movie, one that questions the relationship between sneaker manufacturers and financially deprived kids with exceptional talent. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'A YEAR WITHOUT LOVE' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Spanish) Anahí Berneri's debut film recounts in uncomfortable close-up the day-to-day activities of a youngish gay writer from Buenos Aires afflicted with AIDS, who becomes involved in S-and-M. Based on the diaries of the real Pablo Peréz (he is also co-writer of the script), the film reveals rare insight into the endurance and treatment of illness, but is never fully arresting. (Laura Kern) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series BEST OF THE AFRICAN DIASPORA FILM FESTIVAL (Through Wednesday) BAMcinematek's festival of independent black films from around the world begins today.

Or at least a compromise: as part of his chamber music series, Jaime Laredo presides over a program split between Martinu (the String Sextet and the Duo No. 1 for Violin and Cello) and Mozart (the Oboe Quartet in F and a Divertimento in D). Among the guest performers are the violist Kim Kashkashian, the oboist Maurice Bourgue and the violinist Jennifer Koh. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Kozinn) COUNTER)INDUCTION (Tonight) This vibrant young new-music ensemble offers a program of modern Italian works, including scores by Salvatore Sciarrino, Luca Francesconi, Giacinto Scelsi, Emanuela Ballio, Fabio Vacchi, Luca Belcastro and Anne-Marie Turcotte. 8, Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 645-2800; $12 suggested donation. (Kozinn) ERIC CUTLER (Tonight) Eric Cutler is a young tenor with a loud voice that's making some opera people listen. The Metropolitan Opera offers him this season as a solid if unrefined Tamino; the Richard Tucker Foundation gave him its 2005 award. Tonight, he offers songs of France (Hahn, Fauré), Italy (Respighi) and America (Musto, Previn and Barber). 7:30, Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $32. (Midgette) * LUIGI DALLAPICCOLA (Thursday) As Continuum's overview will show, this composer balanced innovation and links to earlier traditions. His music has disappeared to an alarming degree since his death in 1975, but when his music turns up, it invariably invites further exploration. This installment of the Composer Portrait series is your best chance. Included is a selection of works that run from the 1940's (''Rencesvals,'' the Sonata Canonica and ''Due Studi'') through 1970 (''Sicut Umbra''). 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $20; $12 for students. (Kozinn) * 'IN YOUR EAR TOO' (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) The composer John Adams has developed a regular curatorial gig at Zankel Hall, which will hold a mini-festival this weekend encompassing everything from jazz (with Dave Douglas and Keystone tomorrow) to the distinctive performance artist Rinde Eckert (in ''An Idiot Divine,'' tonight). On Sunday, an eclectic program of music new and old for piano, violin and clarinet is contrasted with a Palestinian trio of oud virtuosos. Tonight at 7:30, tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $27 to $32. (Midgette) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT (Tonight) Now in its third season, the Met's resident chamber ensemble offers another enticing program: Schnittke's Third Quartet, Giya Kancheli's ''Rag-Gidon-Time,'' Schumann's Piano Quartet and Dvorak's Bagatelles for two violins, cello and harmonium. 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $30. (Eichler) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Thursday) The Philharmonic has made a big deal of paying tribute to Elliott Carter this season, but its performances of his works are so few and so widely spaced that you've probably forgotten about it. Not to worry: this week, Lorin Maazel and the orchestra get to one of Mr. Carter's true classics, the Variations for Orchestra, along with works by Brahms and Kodaly and, with Gil Shaham, Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1. On Thursday, Robert Spano takes over for the premiere of John Harbison's ''Milosz Songs,'' with Dawn Upshaw as the soloist, as well as works by Bartok and Bernstein. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $23 to $76 today; $26 to $94 tomorrow and Thursday. (Kozinn) JOHN O'CONOR (Thursday) This Irish pianist returns to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with a program of Beethoven, Schubert and Haydn. 8 p.m., Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Holland) * 'LA PASIÓN SEGÚN SAN MARCOS' (Monday and Tuesday) ''Fasten your seat belts'' was one insider's advice at the Brooklyn Academy of Music a few years ago when this lionized piece by the composer Osvaldo Golijov had its New York premiere. A recasting of a Bach Passion for the South American vernacular, this ''Pasión'' is certainly approachable and stirring, and Mr. Golijov's biggest popular success -- if not perhaps as ground-breaking as many seem to think. 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $65. (Midgette) * MARGARET LENG TAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) John Cage's 1944 score-painting, ''Chess Pieces,'' disappeared into a private collection soon after he wrote it, so when the pianist Margaret Leng Tan first saw it, last year, she knew she had a virtually unknown Cage work to perform. It wasn't that easy: the painting is a chessboard made of score shards, and Ms. Tan's job was to determine how those fragments were meant to fall together. She is playing the work, along with Vittorio Rieti's ''Chess Serenade'' and Michael Nyman's ''Pawn to King Four,'' as part of the Anthology Film Archives' ''Chess and Surrealism'' program. 8 p.m., Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 979-1027 ; $12. (Kozinn) * CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF (Wednesday) This exceptional 39-year-old German violinist does not have the name recognition of some other soloists or the marketing muscle behind his career, but the depth and sensitivity of his playing have rightly made him a favorite among critics and connoisseurs. This week, he is joined by the pianist Lars Vogt in a promising program of all three Brahms violin sonatas. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45. (Eichler) 'VoiceS OF LIGHT' (Tonight) Richard Einhorn composed this vivid, unusual oratorio as a soundtrack for Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic ''The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' a compressed telling of Joan of Arc's trial by an ecclesiastical court and of her execution by being burned at the stake. It is to be performed by the Ensemble Sospeso, the New Amsterdam Singers, and Anonymous 4, which assembles only for special projects these days. 8, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Kozinn) VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) George Steel and his superb chamber choir turn their attention to Jacobus Vaet, an obscure Flemish Renaissance master. This program of Vaet's sublime sacred music is filled out with works by Clemens Non Papa and Nicolas Gombert. 8 p.m., Church of St. Paul the Apostle, Columbus Avenue at 60th Street, (212) 854-7799; $35; $21 for students. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * CARRIE AHERN (Thursday) Ms. Ahern describes her new ''Red,'' inspired by Margaret Atwood's ''Handmaid's Tale'' and by the clean lines of the performance space, as a ''work of beautiful suffocation.'' Her all-female ensemble includes some of the city's most interesting dance artists. (Through Feb. 26.) 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Jennifer Dunning) RICHARD ALSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) The choreographer Richard Alston has been a mainstay of English contemporary dance since the early 1970's, and his musical, often understated work is always worth watching. This program presents three dances new to New York audiences: ''Fever,'' to Monteverdi; ''Such Longing,'' to Chopin's Nocturnes and Études; and ''Gypsy Mixture,'' from the delightfully titled CD ''Electric Gypsyland.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $38. (Roslyn Sulcas) JULIO BOCCA'S BOCCATANGO (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Bocca and his Ballet Argentino celebrate the tango in two performances in the New York City area this weekend. Tonight at 8, they will perform at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; $20 to $56. The company also performs tomorrow at 8 p.m. at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100; $40 and $52; $37 and $49 for 65+. (Dunning) * CONSTRUCTION COMPANY 2006 DANCE GALA (Tomorrow and Sunday) This enclave for uncategorizable performing artists will celebrate itself by presenting dance by Ariane Anthony, Sally Bowden, Carolyn Lord, Cedric Neugebauer, Rebecca Windmiller and Linda Seifert with Alan Good. 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (212) 924-7882; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) 'DANCING IN BLACK' (Today, and Monday through Thursday) This free exhibition of African-American dance photography and drawings by Mansa K. Mussa, Richard Barclit and Bruce Harman celebrates Black History Month. (Through Feb. 28.) Mondays through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Harold B. Lemmerman Gallery, Hepburn Hall, New Jersey City University, 2039 Kennedy Boulevard, Jersey City, (201) 200-3246. (Dunning) DANZAHOY (Tuesday through Feb. 26) Employing both tango and the joropo, a traditional Venezuelan dance, Danzahoy brings ""Exodo"" to the Joyce for its first New York appearance in more than 20 years. Tuesday through next Friday at 8 p.m.; Feb. 25 at 2 and 8 p.m.; Feb. 26 at 2 and 7:30 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $36. (Claudia La Rocco) GINA GIBNEY DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Gibney explores the worlds of finite reality and the unknowable, and she has made a third new world of them in her mysterious, subtle ''unbounded.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday night at 7:30. , Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Dunning) HUBBARD STREET DANCE CHICAGO (Tomorrow) This modern company tackles William Forsythe's knotty ballet vocabulary in ''Enemy in the Figure.'' 8 p.m., with free lecture at 7:30 p.m., the Performing Arts Center, Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6200; $32 and $52. (La Rocco) SARA EAST JOHNSON'S LAVA (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Johnson's award-winning, all-female company, LAVA, presents ''(w)HOLE'' (short for ''The Whole History of Life on Earth''), its first new work since 2003. Using trapeze, Chinese acrobatics and swing dancing, among other things, the company tackles rock formation, punctuated equilibrium theory and magnetic polarity reversal with its usual strength and verve. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 5 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.TheaterMania.com; $20 to $25. (Erika Kinetz) BILL T. JONES/ARNIE ZANE DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday, Thursday and Feb. 25) Dance gets a remix in ''Another Evening: I Bow Down,'' featuring old and new work by Mr. Jones, as well as live music and digital manipulations by Daniel Bernard Roumain. 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200; $35 and $45. (La Rocco) JUILLIARD SCHOOL: 'NEW DANCES/NEW MUSIC' (Wednesday and Thursday) New dances by Adam Hougland, Jessica Lang and Alan Hineline to new music by Christopher Rouse, Pete M. Wyer and Jerome Begin, conducted by Andrea Quinn. (Through Feb. 26.) 8 p.m., Juilliard Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $20; $10 (at box office) for students and 65+. (Dunning) * KINGS OF THE DANCE (Thursday through next Sunday) Conceptually yet another ripoff of the Three Tenors, this program upon closer inspection looks a little more interesting than that. It offers Angel Corella and Ethan Stiefel of American Ballet Theater, Johan Kobborg of the Royal Ballet and Nikolay Tsiskaridize of the Bolshoi Ballet, joined by Alina Cojocaru and others from the Royal Ballet. There will be new choreography by Christopher Wheeldon, Roland Petit, Nils Christie, Stanton Welch and Tim Rushton, along with solos by Balanchine, Grigorovich, Petipa and Bournonville, and Fleming Flindt's complete ''Lesson,'' in which each king will dance the role of the teacher on successive nights. Thursday through Feb. 25 at 8 p.m., Feb. 26 at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.citycenter.org; $35 to $150. (John Rockwell) ROMULO LARREA TANGO ENSEMBLE (Tonight) Three tango-dancing couples, and music by Carlos Gardel and Astor Piazzolla. 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $32.50 and $37.50. (Dunning) SUSAN MARSHALL AND COMPANY (Wednesday) Ms. Marshall celebrates her company's 20th anniversary with her new ''Cloudless,'' a variety show, she says, of ''short, punchy, poem-sized pieces.'' (Through Feb. 25.) 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, corner of Valley Road and Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112; $35. (Dunning) * 'MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP: THE EARLY YEARS' (Through March 5) This free exhibition of photographs by Tom Brazil is the opening event of a five-week celebration of the 25th anniversary of Mr. Morris's company. Daily, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. (Dunning) * REJINA NEJMAN & COMPANY (Thursday) Ms. Nejman's ''Velocity of Things,'' in which six characters trapped in a futuristic carnival search desperately for balance in a fast-paced world, won the FringeNYC's 2005 Outstanding Choreography Award. (Through Feb. 26.) 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $18; $15 for students and 65+; T.D.F. accepted. (Dunning) * NEW YORK FLAMENCO FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Performing this weekend will be Cristina Hoyo's Ballet Flamenco de Andalucia (tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Compania Antonio el Pipa with the guest performers Mariana Cornejo, Concha Vargas and Juana del Pipa (Sunday at 7 p.m.) City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org or www.flamencofestival.org; $30 to $65. (Dunning) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL: SALLY-ANNE FRIEDLAND DANCE DRAMA COMPANY (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Tel Aviv-based Sally-Anne Friedland Dance Drama Company makes its United States debut. The South African-born Ms. Friedland danced with the Batsheva and Bat-Dor companies, but her own work is (according to the press materials) inspired by Carolyn Carlson and Pina Bausch. In her world premiere of ''Borders'' and the American premiere of ''Red,'' we are promised that ''the abstraction of dance meets the drama of life.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; students and 62+, $15. (Sulcas) BETH SOLL & COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Soll will present ''Mortal Angels,'' a dance (Ms. Soll) and video (Bryan Hayes) piece inspired in part by the image of a hidden child angel. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Construction Company, 10 East 18th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 924-7882; $12. (Dunning) MAXINE STEINMAN & DANCERS (Wednesday, Thursday, Feb. 25 and Feb. 26) The 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Festival continues with a program that includes two premieres, one a collaboration between Ms. Steinman and her husband, the sculptor Alfredo Cardenas, and the video artist Tom Ruth. Wednesday, Thursday and Feb. 25 at 8 p.m., Feb. 26 at 2 and 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500; $20; students and 62+, $15. (La Rocco) SUMMERFEST '06: BATOTO YETU (Wednesday) This free series -- what more do you need than palm trees for an early summer -- continues with music, dance and storytelling by bust-a-gut child performers. 12:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505 or www.worldfinancialcenter.com.

(Dunning) REGGIE WILSON/FIST & HEEL PERFORMANCE GROUP (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Wilson and his superb musicians and dancers create a world that fuses the cultural traditions of the black American South, urban America, Africa and the Caribbean, this time in ''The Tale: Npinpee Nckutchie and the Tail of the Golden Dek,'' a new work that explores sexual attraction. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces which the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and commerce,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown Boyd & Evans: Color in Black and White' This husband-and-wife team from England makes large landscape and cityscape photographs in which all but selected central images have been drained of color. The best pictures, like that of the rusty brown tank standing all by itself in the midst of a black and white desert, are more strange and dreamy than gimmicky. Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 439-1700, through Feb. 25. (Ken Johnson) Robert S. Neuman: 'Fifty Years' With good humored generosity and a skillful, sensuous touch, Mr. Neuman has painted his way through several different genres over the course of his five-decade career, including Abstract Expressionism, geometric formalism, funky allegorical narrative and painterly landscapes that mourn the losses of the American Indians. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through March 4. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Norman Ballard: 'Standing Waves' A theatrical lighting designer and veteran laser light artist presents recent compact sculptures in which fine, colored laser lines rhythmically swing or rotate through colored liquids in glass containers. Framed by rugged metal elements, the sculptures combine industrial-strength materialism and the hypnotic appeal of the lava lamp. Bryce Wolkowitz, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 243-8830, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) EIRIK JOHNSON: 'BORDERLANDS' Small, serendipitous encounters in the landscape are the subjects of Eirik Johnson's large color photographs: junk hung picturesquely on a wire fence along a shore; a red sweater splayed between trees in a woods; a fragile, impromptu bridge of skinny longs laid across a creek. In one photograph, a huge crumple of grayish fabric plopped on grass and maybe used as a shelter has the imposing look of a sculptural boulder. There are no control-freak setups here. Rather, it seems that Mr. Johnson helps the camera make its own discoveries, often with poetic results. Yossi Milo Gallery, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Feb. 25. (Glueck) Sarah Pickering: 'Explosions' Winner of the 2005 Jerwood Photography Award, Ms. Pickering presents large and lush photographs of exploding bombs incongruously set off in pastoral settings as part of law enforcement training programs. Daniel Cooney, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 255-8158, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) ALEX SOTH: 'NIAGARA' Love and romance play tackily in these photographs of small town young people, while the nearby falls of Niagara provide a grand symphonic background. Mr. Soth's lens lingers on cheap motels that serve as wedding and honeymoon settings, people awkwardly dressed in celebration clothes, a purple-prose letter conveying declarations of the heart. On a grungy street an unglamorous mother stares unbeguilingly at the camera while cradling an infant. Mr. Soth, whose antecedents would seem to include the faux-vernacular photographs of William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, intersperses these shots with glorious scenics of the eternal Falls, doing their thing above and beyond local happenings. Ho, hum. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street (212) 741-1111, through Feb. 25. (Glueck) * TRIFECTA This energetic curatorial face-off consists of three exhibitions devoted to young artists (nearly 20 in all) organized by the gallery's owner, Becky Smith, and her assistants, Esme Watanabe and Erica Samuels. The three groupings progress from minimal to hyper-real, with Ms. Watanabe's selection, which lands somewhere in the middle, edging out those of her colleagues. Sara VanderBeek's set-up photographs, which suggest a Surrealist's garret, are a find. Bellwether, 194 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Feb. 25. (Smith) Johannes Wohnseifer: 'New Alphabet' Paintings and sculptures in several different styles by this brainy young German conceptualist obscurely explore semiotics relating to industrial, military, political and popular-entertainment spheres. He has a keen sense of design, and the sculptures made of pieces of shiny bent metal and thick felt are extremely elegant. But over all, his project looks like that of an academic theory wonk. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo * BEC STUPAK/HONEYGUN LABS: 'RADICAL EARTH MAGIC FLOWER' This ambitious gallery debut centers on a blind remake of Jack Smith's 1963 orgiastic ode to transvestism and Hollywood camp, ''Flaming Creatures,'' projected on a wall opposite the original, with Ms. Stupak's subtitlelike storyboards appearing in between. The contrast is mutually enhancing up to a point; the Stupak provides color and detail missing from the blurry, black-and-white Smith film, but the earlier effort still carries the day. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300, through Feb. 25. (Smith) * ZILVINAS KEMPINAS In contrasting works, the artist uses videotape to create one environment and record another. The resulting Op Art installation and the bike ride through Times Square conspire; sensory overload, both retinal and aural, ensues, as does a surprising application of the less-is-more principle. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, through Feb. 25. (Smith) Other Galleries Carla Accardi and Lucio Fontana: 'Infinite Space' Bridging the gap between higher metaphysics and raw materialism in Italy in the 1960's and 70's, Fontana famously made single-color canvases that he decisively slashed or punctured, while Accardi wrapped strips of painted transparent plastic around wooden stretchers or painted fields of optically vibrating calligraphy. A selection of works by both artists makes for a surprisingly handsome and elegant show that is nicely complemented by a small installation of recent works by Richard Tuttle in the project room. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. Granted that much of Downtown was throwaway stuff, too ephemeral and experimental to last; for better or for worse, it helped to change the definition of what art and artists might be. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) * HOME STORIES: AN INSIDE LOOK AT SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES IN AUSTRIA Departing from standard-issue architectural exhibitions with a slightly too clever design, this show of 21 recent houses includes portraits of their inhabitants and poster-size sheets free for the taking that function as both labels and catalog. The totality feels like a collaboration among Bernd and Hilla Becher, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and the contemporary photographer of your choice, but it makes an excellent case for the vitality of Austrian architecture. Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, through Feb. 25. (Smith) * 'Speak: Nine Cartoonists' Original drawings and studies by nine of the best comic book artists in the business, including R. Crumb, Daniel Clowes, Gary Panter, Chris Ware and Art Spiegelman. Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 647-7778. Through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Last Chance * Ellen Brooks: Vintage Photographs from the 70's Cultural wars have come and gone -- actually, they've never really gone -- since 1976, when Ellen Brooks first showed a dozen larger-than-life-size studio photographs of nude male and female adolescents. Eight more pictures, never before exhibited, from the same series are on view at Roth, and it is easy to see how, in the right (meaning wrong) setting, they could still cause a fuss today. The inclusion of documentation, including early reviews of the work, give these remarkable pictures a historical context. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) WILLIE COLE: SOLE TO SOUL An adept recycler of found objects used as tools or in assemblages to evoke different varieties of African sculpture, Mr. Cole has expanded both palette and references in his latest efforts. Here women's high heels, arranged by hue, handsomely evoke rose windows, mandalas and lotus flowers, as well as religious multiplicity (Smith). Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 367-7474; closes tomorrow. (Smith) The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400; closes Sunday. (Cotter) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639; closes Sunday.(Johnson)"

Richard Foreman, a downtown institution, tries multimedia in his latest experimental event, which features large projections shot in Australia (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. Broadway 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). (On Tuesday, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.) Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater; 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM' The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY' Sounds like Shakespeare, bleeds like a ''Friday the 13th'' movie. Authorship of this 400-year-old play is uncertain, but the Red Bull Theater's interpretation, adapted and directed by Jesse Berger, is definitive, anchored by a dynamite performance by Matthew Rauch as a fellow bent on avenging his love's death in a dukedom full of degenerates (2:05). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255. (Genzlinger) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance * 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE OTHER SIDE' In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Anne Midgette) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'APRIL'S SHOWER' (No rating, 98 minutes) A lighthearted comedy about the outing of a bride-to-be and her five-year relationship with her maid of honor. Though filled with sitcom-ready stereotypes, ''April's Shower'' presents a refreshingly volatile view of sexual orientation. As faces are slapped and partners are switched, the movie leaves you with the feeling that gay is good, but bi can be even better. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) 'EL CARRO' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Pleasant but slight, this sociological farce from Colombia tells the story of a vintage convertible that changes the lives of the middle-class Velez family to mildly humorous effect. (Nathan Lee) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2' (PG, 100 minutes) In this unnecessary sequel to a mediocre remake, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his clan visit Lake Winnetka, also the regular summer dwelling of Tom's longtime archrival (Eugene Levy). A tiresome film, full of repetitive, misfired jokes, false emotions and caricatures. Even the pairing of Mr. Martin and Mr. Levy fails to inspire anything more than the occasional smile.(Laura Kern) 'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott) 'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE' (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott) 'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career and the most anguished. (Dargis) * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott) 'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott) 'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Lee) 'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of ''The Graduate,'' in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is. (Scott) * 'STATE OF FEAR: THE TRUTH ABOUT TERRORISM' (No rating, 94 minutes, in English and Spanish) Based on more than 16,000 testimonies to the Peruvian Truth & Reconciliation Commission, Pamela Yates's harrowing documentary chronicles the 20 years of terror between the rise of the Maoist leader Abimael Guzmán and his Shining Path guerrillas, and the November 2000 overthrow of President Alberto Fujimori's corrupt dictatorship. Together with ''The Montesinos Media Buy,'' seven minutes of surveillance video depicting the Fujimori regime's media bribery, ''State of Fear'' is a timely lesson on the hazards of choosing security over democracy. (Catsoulis) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'THE WHITE COUNTESS' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Set in Shanghai in 1936 and starring Ralph Fiennes and three Redgraves, the final collaboration between James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (who died during post-production) wants to be a pulse-racing cross between ''Casablanca'' and 'The English Patient.'' But this fussy, pieced-together epic manqué never develops any stamina. (Holden) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program is presenting a series of 11 feature films and 2 shorts by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82). This weekend's film is ''The Merchant of Four Seasons'' (1972), about a depressed fruit peddler in a loveless marriage. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, (212) 924-7771; $10.75.

(Gates) PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION (Through Feb. 6) A complete retrospective of Pixar animated films continues at the Museum of Modern Art. Tonight's films are ''Toy Story 2'' (1999) and two Oscar-winning shorts, ''Geri's Game'' (1997), about an old man playing chess, and ''For the Birds'' (2000), about a group of snobbish feathered friends.

ACT LOCAL HURRICANE BENEFIT (Sunday) The charity group Act Local presents an all-day benefit show for the Southern Arts Federation Emergency Relief Fund, which aids musicians affected by last year's hurricanes. More than 30 local musical acts are scheduled to perform, including the Wrens, Nada Surf, Estevez and Langhorne Slim. All Ages. 1 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Laura Sinagra) AKRON/FAMILY, MI AND L'AU, WOODEN WAND (Tomorrow) This bill sandwiches the whispery Finland-based folk duo Mi and L'au between two weirder acts: the layered and deceptively melodic Akron/Family, a quiescent lo-fi quartet that explores the dark crannies and latent explosiveness of Americana, and Wooden Wand (a k a James Toth), who mixes modal guitars with mutters and yawps that suggest a Pentecostal drunk. 10 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sinagra) BURNSIDE PROJECT (Tonight) The Burnside Project plays its guitars in the intermittently splashing indie-rock style of the slacker 90's but uses electronic burbles beneath. 8, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sinagra) CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN, TRAMPLED BY TURTLES (Tomorrow) The 80's college-rock jokesters Camper van Beethoven recently reunited to release a concept album about a dystopian California. The electric bluegrass band Trampled by Turtles opens. 10 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra) LAURA CANTRELL (Tonight) This singer, guitarist and songwriter has a deep alt-country résumé that includes an old-timey country radio show on WFMU (91.1 FM) and real Southern roots. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 8 and 10, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, between Second and Third Streets, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $15. (Sinagra) OLU DARA, RICHIE HAVENS (Monday) The cornetist Olu Dara leads a group that takes an amiable approach to a stream of good-time American music that runs from old jazz and blues to funk; he keeps audiences happy. An unswerving 60's holdout, Richie Havens is still strumming his guitar with untrammeled momentum, still singing in his grainy baritone and still bringing earnest drama out of protests and stubborn optimism. 7:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles) THE ENGLISH BEAT (Tonight and tomorrow night) Dave Wakeling still performs under the name of his old Birmingham band, which in the 80's mastered a soulful version of British ska and had hits with songs like the jittery ''Mirror in the Bathroom.'' 8, Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212) 941-8100; $25 in advance, $30 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra) MARK EITZEL (Tonight) The American Music Club's Mark Eitzel continues his conspiratorial wallowing and baritone complaints, with increasingly electronic beats of late. The sad-folk outfit Last Town Chorus also plays. 8:30, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sinagra) GOLDEN FESTIVAL (Tonight and Tomorrow) Featuring the energetic Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band, which plays dance music in the Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian and Romany traditions, this two-day festival of regional Balkan dance and music begins with a program that will include John Parish, the Greek-Macedonian Kavala Band and the Scandinavian Loretta Kelley before a midnight Zlatne Uste show. Some of the more than 50 performers filling tomorrow's three performance spaces hail from places like Bulgaria, Slovakia and Macedonia, but the bill also includes admirers from Norway, Iran and Louisiana.

(Sinagra) HARD-FI (Tuesday) Using dub tactics like ominous echoes and faraway sirens to add dimension to its paranoid but melodic arena punk sound, this British band creates a more cavernous and even cinematic space than most. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra) HUUN-HUUR-TU (Tomorrow) Cowboys from Tuva, where Siberia meets Mongolia, cultivate the technique of throat singing: producing a deep bass note and two or three harmonics above it, all at the same time. Tibetan monks use a similar technique for Buddhist chants. Huun-Huur-Tu uses the style for ancient herding songs and newer material. It is an eerie, riveting sound, like a growl linked to whistling winds, and it seems both raw and timeless. 8 p.m., Leonard Nimoy Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Pareles) JAZZANOVA (Sunday) Alexander Barck performs as an ambassador of Berlin's Jazzanova, an electronic music collective that has always placed an emphasis on groove over glitch. 10 p.m., Cielo, 18 Little West 12th Street, meatpacking district, (212) 645-5700; $10 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) FREEDY JOHNSTON (Tomorrow) Freedy Johnston's finely turned country-rock songs have carefully balanced melodies that he sings in a winsome tenor. But for all their classic symmetry, they're the confessions of desperate, unsavory and unbalanced characters. 7:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Pareles) B. B. KING: TRIBUTE TO MARTIN LUTHER KING (Sunday) The bluesman B. B. King's falsetto vocal flips and vibrato guitar licks have been an indelible influence on the blues and rock traditions. He made his musical reputation in Memphis, which is also where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. died. This Sunday, on the eve of Martin Luther King Day, he plays a show in the civil rights leader's honor. 7 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833; $35 to $100. (Sinagra) THE JUAN MACLEAN (Tomorrow) These know-it-all hipster musicologists play electro disco ornamented by clang and Moog-like warps. It's the sound of postindustrial slackers having a party in a junk shop, dancing freely. 9 p.m., Supreme Trading, 213 North Eighth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4224; free with R.S.V.P. at www.crashinin.com. (Sinagra) KOOL KEITH, SLUM VILLAGE (Tomorrow) The shape-shifting rapper Kool Keith's Ultramagnetic MC's were a critical hit in the late 80's, helping to nudge old school dozens-playing forward with imaginative grooves and space-is-the-place lyrics. Solo, he created personae like Dr. Octagon and Dr. Dooom, though his intricate, zany rhymes have grown less rewarding over time. Detroit's Slum Village also plays. 11:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) LYCAON PICTUS (Tomorrow) Aaron Diskin used to play with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' kinetic, stinging guitarist Nick Zinner, but Mr. Diskin's music for the synthesizer-bass-drum trio Lycaon Pictus is darker, recalling the apocalypse imagined by forerunners like Pere Ubu. 8 p.m., Kingsland Tavern, 244 Nassau Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-9883; $5. (Sinagra) PABLO MAYOR AND FOLKLORE URBANO, FORRÓ FOR ALL (Thursday) Pablo Mayor's Folklore Urbano gives Colombian folk some modern inflections. Rob Curto's Forró for All plays bouncy accordion-based party music from northeastern Brazil. 7:30 p.m., Makor Steinhardt Building, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan; $12. (Sinagra) MI AND L'AU (Tonight) The Finnish singer Mi and the French musician L'au, after becoming a couple in Paris, reportedly moved to the woods in Finland to record what they will showcase here, a cache of austere, wintery bedroom folk. 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sinagra) ELIZABETH MITCHELL: YOU ARE MY FLOWER (Tomorrow) Like several indie-rockers, the soft-pop band Ida's Elizabeth Mitchell and Daniel Littleton have turned to making kids' music lately. Their approach takes the form of reinterpreting classic folk songs. Here Ms. Mitchell plays and sings selections from that repertory. 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, (212) 864-5400; $14; members and children, $10; Just Kidding Club members, $5. (Sinagra) ALEC OUNSWORTH, PURE HORSEHAIR, MICHAEL LEVITON (Tomorrow) The frontman of the local rock band Clap Your Hands Say Yeah has a side project with members of Ida, Boss Tweed and Ill Ease. Also on the bill are Pure Horsehair (a k a Garrett Devoe), a fingerpicking folk-pop songwriter, and Michael Leviton, who plays sea shanties on the ukulele. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10. (Sinagra) MIGUEL POVEDA WITH GIOVANNI HIDALGO (Thursday through Jan. 21) Th0e raspy drama of traditional flamenco singing arrives in a new generation with Miguel Poveda, an award-winning flamenco vocalist. He plays here with Giovanni Hidalgo, a percussionist who can make his conga drums crackle, slide, sing melodies and just about talk. 7:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $130. (Sinagra) THE ROLLING STONES, METRIC (Wednesday) The Stones' newest album is their most stripped-down in 20 years. And as the 62-year-old sexpot Mick Jagger shouts ''Sweet Neo Con'' from stadium stages, the Stones even seem politically relevant. Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Haines, Metric finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Haines's shuddering alto functions as both a weapon and a come-on. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $454.50. (Sinagra) RYE COALITION (Tonight) Rye Coalition began as an angular rock band in the style of Fugazi but now mixes in more elements of 70's hard rock. Shelby also plays. 9:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $8. (Sinagra) SUFJAN STEVENS (Tomorrow) This singer-songwriter and banjoist is imbued with a Coplandesque musical vision and an expansive narcissism reminiscent of Walt Whitman's, though his lyrics can overreach and his compositions veer into the folksily baroque. 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9800; $20 to $45 (sold out). (Sinagra) SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK (Sunday) Gospel, blues, African rhythms, protest songs and the joys of harmony are the enduring touchstones of this all-women a cappella group, which never forgets to leaven righteousness with pleasure. 2 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $8. (Pareles) THE SYN (Tuesday) Back when the Who used to play the Marquee, the Syn used to open for them. One band member, Chris Squire, went on to become way more famous as the bassist with Yes. Forty years later, the Syn have re-formed to play their old proto-prog tunes and make new music as well. 7 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Sinagra) KT TUNSTALL (Tuesday) A British singer nominated for a Mercury Prize, KT Tunstall takes breaks from her preferred 70's folk-pop to explore dance music and quieter, rootsier styles. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12 (sold out). (Sinagra) THE WRENS (Tonight) These noise-artist rockers write about life in their home state of New Jersey, but not with a Fountains of Wayne smirk. With their routinely understated, meditative albums and their intense, up-tempo live shows, they offer two different responses to suburban tensions. 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 (sold out).(Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, $15 minimum. (Stephen Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) 'SINGING ASTAIRE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) This smart, airy revue, which pays tribute to Fred Astaire, has returned, featuring Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. (Barbara Fasano fills in for Ms. Kole tomorrow.) 5:30 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; $30, with a $10 minimum. (Holden) * ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, Ms. Stritch weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue of her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $125; dinner, required, is served at 6:30. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. CLAUDIA ACUÑA (Tonight and Thursday) Ms. Acuña is a vocalist attracted to lyrical high drama and guided by the pulse and passion of her native Chile; she performs a solo show tonight, and shares a Thursday bill with Marta Topferova, another singer enamored of Latin music, but with origins in Eastern Europe. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen) THE BAD PLUS (Wednesday and Thursday) The pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer David King piqued jazz purists a few years ago with a spate of irreverent cover tunes; ''Suspicious Activity?'' (Columbia), their most recent album, shifted the focus to epic-sounding originals. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) KENNY GARRETT QUARTET/HIROMI (Tuesday through Jan. 22) Mr. Garrett is a forceful and propulsive personality on the alto saxophone; Hiromi is a diminutive yet dynamic presence on electric keyboards and piano. Both artists favor tight ensembles, although that commonality doesn't quite explain this odd double bill. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen) ROY HARGROVE AND MULGREW MILLER (Sunday) Mr. Hargrove, the trumpeter, and Mr. Miller, the pianist, share a postbop language especially rooted in the blues; their duo performance comes under the banner of chamber jazz, but the music they concoct should make the term seem quaint. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $25. Mr. Miller also plays with his trio tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25.

(Chinen) ROBERT HURST GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Hurst, a bassist with a deep and earthy tone, has long been a resourceful small-group composer, as well as an underappreciated bandleader. This weekend he applies those talents to two distinct crews: a next-generation quartet with the pianist Robert Glasper, the guitarist Lionel Loueke and the drummer Karriem Riggins (tonight); and a quintet of somewhat more experienced peers, like the trumpeter Eddie Henderson, the alto saxophonist Donald Harrison and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson (tomorrow). 11:30 p.m. and 1 a.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) GRETCHEN PARLATO (Tomorrow; Tuesday through Jan. 21) The lilting cadence and mellow sonority of Ms. Parlato's voice have earned her a good many casual admirers; a continuing deluge of critical acclaim has more to do with her musicianship, which is never more pronounced than when she performs with the guitarist Lionel Loueke. Tomorrow at 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; no cover. Tuesday through Thursday at 11 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $10, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) RE:ARRANGED: THE MUSIC OF JACO PASTORIUS, GIL EVANS, LENNON & McCARTNEY (Through Sunday) The sweep of this project, which clearly runs the risk of incoherence, could be a perfect challenge for the pianist and accordionist Gil Goldstein, one of the most resourceful arrangers in jazz today. Just as promising is the lineup, featuring the trumpeter Randy Brecker, the saxophonist Chris Potter, the vibraphonist Mike Mainieri, the bassist Richard Bona, the percussionist Don Alias, and an improvising string trio led by the violinist Joyce Hammann. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) CHRIS POTTER TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Potter is among the small number of tenor saxophonists to have absorbed both Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane and emerged sounding like his own man; he appears here in the setting that both predecessors helped popularize, backed only by bass (Scott Colley) and drums (Jeff Ballard). 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen) TIM RIES AND THE ROLLING STONES PROJECT (Thursday) Mr. Ries, a tenor and soprano saxophonist who has toured extensively with the rock 'n' roll institution mentioned here, rearranges a handful of its signature hits, smoothing many of the rough edges but also uncovering ample opportunities for improvisation. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Tomorrow and Thursday) Mr. Robbins, an alto saxophonist and clarinetist with a cool tone and a thoughtfully off-kilter sensibility, leads an ensemble consisting of Sam Sadigursky on tenor and soprano saxophones, Eliot Cardinaux on keyboards, Mike Gamble on guitar, Thomas Morgan on bass and Tyshawn Sorey on drums. Tomorrow at 9:30 p.m., Detour, 349 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 533-6212; cover, $5.

(Chinen) KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Through Sunday) Mr. Rosenwinkel is almost certainly the most widely hailed jazz guitarist under 40, especially among musicians; his deeply sympathetic rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner provides the focal point of this shadowy and slippery ensemble, which also includes Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Eric Harland on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) YOSVANY TERRY GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Terry, a saxophonist and percussionist, chases postbop ideals without abandoning the rhythmic pull of his native Cuba; in this ensemble, he plays alongside the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, the guitarist Mike Moreno, the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Yunior Terry, the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts and the percussionist Pedro Martinez. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15.(Chinen) MICHAEL WEISS QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Weiss, a pianist with extensive sideman credits in the jazz mainstream, turns the spotlight toward his own compositions, including a commissioned suite called ''Three Doors''; his band includes Steve Wilson on alto and soprano saxophones, Ugonna Okegwo on bass, Daniel Sadownick on percussion and Adam Cruz on drums. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * RANDY WESTON AND FRIENDS (Tomorrow) The pianism of Randy Weston can recall that of Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, but as a composer he has long reached beyond strict jazz traditions; this concert, dubbed ''The Spirit of Afrika,'' will commemorate the year of his 80th birthday with an assortment of friends, including the saxophonists Billy Harper and Cecil Payne, the trombonist Benny Powell, the trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater and the conga virtuoso Candido. 8 p.m., Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, Long Island University, 1 University Place, at DeKalb Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4181, ext. 2229, or www.651ARTS.org; $35, $45 and $80. (Chinen) REGGIE WORKMAN'S BREW (Tuesday) Mr. Workman's bass playing has always evinced a graceful athleticism and an attunement to texture; here he organizes a setting that should emphasize both traits, in a trio with Miya Masaoka on koto and Gerry Hemingway on percussion. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $15. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. AVALON STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) Since its founding in 1995 at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival in Connecticut, this dynamic ensemble has won several notable competitions and secured coveted residencies, most recently at Indiana University.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083; $35; $25 for students.

(Midgette) BRONX OPERA (Tomorrow and Sunday) There are some -- O.K., maybe it's just me -- who consider Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' the perfect opera: a wrenching story, spectacular vocal and ensemble music, and it all clocks in at about 50 minutes. The enterprising Bronx Opera has paired this story of royal passion and supernatural mischief with Chabrier's ''Incomplete Education,'' a light piece about a young newlywed's search for information on how to proceed. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., the Lovinger Theater at Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833; $15 to $30. (Allan Kozinn) CHAMBERFEST (Tuesday through Thursday) You might think that the Juilliard School had enough to handle with its ambitious musical celebration of its centenary, not to mention the annual Focus festival, coming up at the end of the month. But this week the school is also presenting this series of free concerts of diverse chamber works performed by accomplished student musicians. There are piano trios by Ives and Shostakovich; works by Beethoven and Dvorak will jostle against works by Stravinsky and Morton Feldman. For those who like large-scale chamber pieces, there is Mendelssohn's rousing Octet. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. at Paul Hall at the Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street; Wednesday at 1 p.m. at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406.

(Kozinn) 'COMPOSER=PERFORMER' (Thursday) Adventurous programming has been part of Symphony Space's calendar on and off over the years, but lately the hall seems intent on joining the Miller Theater as a new-music center on the Upper West Side. In ''Composer=Performer,'' it offers music written and performed by Todd Reynolds, one of the violinists in the quartet Ethel; Joan La Barbara, who is known for her range-stretching vocalizing; and John King, a guitarist and violinist who will offer a preview of a score he is writing for the Mannheim Ballet. 7:30 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $21; $16 for students and 65+.

In collaboration with the Library of Congress, Mr. Hampson is embarking on an 11-city American tour with a program that covers American song from the 1700's to the present. There will be psalms, hymns, folk songs, cowboy songs, spirituals and art songs -- not just by familiar composers like Bernstein and Copland but also by influential (and overlooked) composers like Arthur Farwell and Elinor Remick Warren. Wolfram Rieger will be the pianist. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $72.(Tommasini) MANHATTAN STRING QUARTET (Tuesday) Thirty-five years old and going strong, this group is presenting a complete cycle of the Shostakovich quartets during its residency at St. Bart's.

(Midgette) MUSIC OFF THE WALLS (Sunday) ''Manufactured Landscapes,'' the Brooklyn Museum's exhibition of Edward Burtynsky's photographs, ends on Sunday, but just as these pictures of industrial sites are about to be packed up, musicians from the Brooklyn Philharmonic will offer a program of chamber works that also evoke landscapes, natural and industrial. The composers are Debussy, Varèse, Cage, John Luther Adams and Theodore Wiprud. 3 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 488-5913; $15; $10 for students and 65+.

The concert's title, ''Mozart's Autumn Years,'' is a bit odd for a composer who died at 35, but you get the idea: included are late works, including the Symphony No. 41 and the incomparably beautiful Clarinet Concerto, with Karl Herman as the soloist. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (800) 255-3476; $20 to $75.

Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRaPHY: 'African-American Vernacular Photography,' through Feb. 26. These days, collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in an exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Ken Johnson) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from Southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. On the secular side but equally dazzling are two portraits of men from a long series of male visages done by Antonello in the 1460's and 70's. The intensely human play of expression on the subjects' faces makes a connection with the viewer that few artists before or since have been able to achieve. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Grace Glueck) MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. (See above.) (Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Holland Cotter) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, (800) 944-8639. (Johnson) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored, Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of American Modernists who were active between World Wars I and II. This substantial exhibition of works on paper extends the full-scale Bluemner retrospective now at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman) Galleries: 57th Street * SAUL LEITER: 'EARLY COLOR' In their painterly concentration on shadows, reflections, light and color, the distinctive color photographs that the fashion photographer Saul Leiter took in New York in the 1950's reform street photography by concentrating less on pedestrians than on what they might see. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, through Jan. 21. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea Marina Abramovic: 'Balkan Erotic Epic' This performance artist's staged video tableaus illustrating beliefs about the magical efficacy of certain sexually charged acts are interesting and amusing but less arousing than you might have hoped. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21. (Johnson) ELLEN ALTFEST: 'STILL LIVES' Painted from life in the studio and outside, these thoughtful images of plants, cactuses, logs and driftwood reflect old-fashioned painterly values but still manage a fresh intensity of surface, space, form and intention. Bellwether Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Jan. 21. (Smith) Douglas Anderson: 'New Old Robots' Painted in grayed colors and a brushy, cartoonish style that recalls the Ash Can School and 1930's-era Social Realism, Mr. Anderson's comical and mournful small paintings depict old shoes, plumbing, brick walls, junk cars and outmoded industrial machinery in states of dreamlike animation. Blue Mountain, 530 West 25th Street, (646) 486-4730, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD Ms. Butterfield continues to make horses out of weathered branches and scrap steel that are, at best, magically lifelike. In the big one lying down in the gallery, the metal seems just as alive as the illusory animal. Three horses on the Park Avenue median, however, are out of their element -- too delicate to compete with the traffic and the giant buildings, but perhaps because of that, poetically poignant. Edward Thorp, 210 Eleventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets; and on the Park Avenue median between 52nd and 54th Streets; (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith) 'Head Over Hand: Pushing the Limits of Paint' This well-selected and cohesive 15-artist show presents finely wrought abstract paintings that mix in most cases a hedonistic materialism and a spacey, illusory dimension. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) PHILIPPE MAZAUD: STAGE LIGHT Roaming the countryside in rural Idaho and Nevada, Mr. Mazaud shoots provocative, sometimes spooky night scenes using only found light. Following a current tendency to make pictures that don't tell tales, but move viewers to create their own, he presents scenarios like a small house on a snowy street with two bright windows giving evidence of occupancy, illumined by a streetlight near an old-fashioned telephone pole strung with taut, crisscrossing wires. It could be the setting for domestic felicity or mayhem. Foley, 527 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through Jan. 21. (Glueck) * LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith) Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Bryan Savitz The inventive Mr. Savitz presents a forest of fake tree trunks and objects, like a hammock and a pipe organ, made mainly of scratch-off lottery tickets. A wild group show in the rear gallery called ''Waiting for the Barbarians'' includes a Beaux-Arts-style pornographic vision of flying cowgirls painted by Nicola Verlato; a horribly abused anthropomorphic pig in a sculptural tableau by Fernando Mastrangelo; a large, Dalí-esque ballpoint pen drawing by Tim Maxwell; and a big, semi-abstract digital photograph by Chris Rodrigues, apparently illustrating an otherworldly epic. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 268-1520, through Jan. 21. (Johnson) PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson) * JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea (212) 929-7000, through Jan. 28. (Smith) ROBERT STONE Made with a loose, watercolorlike touch, this young British artist's oil-on-canvas paintings depict enigmatic and vaguely comical scenes, like tiny Canadian Mounties having a secret funeral in the woods, or a pair of travelers in oddly mixed costumes posing with a coffin. They are just sweet and peculiar enough to give you pause. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo MARTIN BEAUREGARD, 'SOMNAMBULIC' Old videos of absurdist performances and a new one about meditating and dreaming are eclipsed by two large stuffed-animal sculptures: a sumptuously furry teddy bear the size of a real cub made from a real bearskin, fearsome big claws and all; and a real moose head with majestic, silver-leafed antlers. Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347, through Feb. 4. (Johnson) Richard Tuttle: 'Constructed Relief Paintings' Among the most appealing works in Mr. Tuttle's current retrospective at the Whitney are the eccentrically shaped, single-color paintings from the 1960's. This show presents more of those playfully Minimalist pieces, which, with their wavering outlines and thick sides, look as if they were cut from slabs of colored rubber. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Other Galleries 'I woke up in a strange place ' The Postmodern mindscape gets a good workout in a show that includes Samantha Simpson's finely drawn allegorical monkeys; Simon Keenleyside's small paintings of gloomily magical birch forests; a puddle of vomit made of pearlescent pink sequins by Craig Fisher; Edward del Rosario's precise paintings of tiny, oddly dressed people; and a Neo- Pop installation representing an old world hunting-lodge interior by Ryan Humphrey. Moti Hasson, 330 West 38th Street, (212) 268-4444, through Jan. 21. (Johnson) Last Chance Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, closing tomorrow.(Johnson) Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, closing Sunday. (718) 638-5000. (Johnson) Gerhard Richter This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) * TAMY BEN-TOR, 'EXPLORATION IN THE DOMAIN OF IDIOCY' On video -- and live on Friday and Saturday afternoons -- a wonderfully talented comic performance artist creates hilariously self-absorbed characters. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, (212) 989-7700, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)"

This New York Musical Theater Festival hit is a satirical musical about several artists racing to finish a musical in three weeks. Apparently, they got it done (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Opens Monday. Dead pets, severed limbs, black Irish humor -- Martin McDonagh (''The Pillowman'') is up to his old tricks in this devilish comedy about terrorism and torture (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. 'DEFIANCE' Opens Tuesday.

Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'BERNARDA ALBA' Opens March 6. The Tony winner Phylicia Rashad (''A Raisin in the Sun'') plays another formidable matriarchal figure with an iron will in Lincoln Center Theater's musical version of Lorca's '' House of Bernarda Alba.'' Michael John LaChiusa, who already has one musical to his name this season, ''See What I Wanna See,'' contributes music and lyrics (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. 'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Opens March 16.

'GREY GARDENS' Opens March 7. Maybe the biggest question mark of the musical season, this intriguing show is an adaptation of the cult documentary about the eccentric relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' Opens March 5. The resourceful Pearl Theater tries to provide an answer to this problem play (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. 'MEASURE FOR PLEASURE' Opens March 8.

Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. 'RING OF FIRE' Opens March 12. Johnny Cash hits form the backbone of this musical about three couples.

Herman Hesse's novel ''Siddhartha,'' the musical version (2:15). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'ACTS OF MERCY: PASSION-PLAY' If there is a coherent story to Michael John Garcés' ''Acts of Mercy: passion-play,'' it is resolutely kept from the audience. As the efforts of two brothers to reconcile with a dying father progress, it seems possible that viewers are meant to discern the consequences of family trauma from punchy monosyllabic combat and repeated expletives, but their efforts to connect are continually frustrated (2:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, west of Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Honor Moore) * 'ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL' This Theater for a New Audience production inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production in which there is nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role. Darko Tresnjak and his cast find a way to make the play's troubled romance, between the adoring Helena and the disdaining Bertram, psychologically credible and even touching (2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'CLEAN ALTERNATIVES' Brian Dykstra's improbable comedy details the good fight fought by a businesswoman turned environmental activist taking on a toxin-spreading megacorporation. The play also depicts the moral transformation of a rapacious lawyer into a love-smitten puppy dog. Call it a fairy tale for our time (2:00). 59E59 Theaters , 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, the play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE' Satire sans teeth by Charles Grodin about internecine warfare within a Fifth Avenue co-op board. Directed by Chris Smith, the show has the embarrassed air of someone who has just been served a choice steak and misplaced his dentures (1:30). Primary Stages, at 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. ( Genzlinger) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing Saturday. (Zinoman) 'JUMP/CUT' Neena Beber's play about an aspiring filmmaker's effort to document his best friend's illness limns despair while leaving the audience exhilarated -- by the fierce beauty of Ms. Beber's writing, and by a captivating performance by Luke Kirby as the brilliant, charismatic, darkly funny manic-depressive whose inescapable fate is the central mystery of the work (2:10). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton; closing Sunday. (212) 239-6200. (Miriam Horn) * 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'LENNY & LOU' This black comedy by Ian Cohen about two brothers and their foul-mouthed, demented mother has the right ingredients for shock theater: four-letter words, sex talk, sex acts. But it somehow doesn't shock (2:15). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday.(Genzlinger) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the archmanipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'PARADISE' A mostly articulate drama by David Foley about an inarticulate young man who may have found Mr. Right or the tipping point that leads him into madness (1:30). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, north of White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. ( Zinoman) 'REAL BLACK MEN DON'T SIT CROSS-LEGGED ON THE FLOOR' The poet and playwright Malik's series of quick, interwoven scenes tracing the lives of African-American men in America, mainly in the last half century, can pack an emotional punch, but it works better as a showcase for some outstanding performances by its eight-member cast than it does as a theater piece (2:00). New Federal Theater, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Andrea Stevens) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983; closing Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'BATTLE IN HEAVEN' (No rating, 94 minutes, in Spanish) An alternatingly mesmerizing and off-putting story about sex, class, God, soccer, an ugly man, a beautiful woman, a dead baby, the dirt below them and the wide sky above. The talented Mexican director Carlos Reygadas (''Japón'') strives to say something about his country, to tap into the spiritual and material desperation of its people, but doesn't seem especially committed to his material. (Manohla Dargis) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens) 'DESERT WIND' (No rating, 80 minutes, in French) In March 2004, the Swiss documentary maker François Kohler took 13 men -- Canadian, French, Swiss and Belgian -- on a two-week trek in the Tunisian Sahara. The group was accompanied by a Swiss psychotherapist, as well as by a team of Tunisian guides with pack camels. The purpose of the trip: to stage a kind of men's encounter group in the desert, encouraging the participants to break away from received notions of masculinity and to talk about their desires, anxieties and deepest fears. Though it generates its share of unintentional giggles, ''Desert Wind'' does manage to take us to a seldom-visited place: the hidden corners of the straight male mind. (Stevens) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'FIREWALL' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A thrill-challenged thriller starring Harrison Ford and directed by Richard Loncraine that manages to entertain mildly only because it traffics in all the familiar action-movie clichés, giving filmgoers ample opportunity to test their action-movie I.Q.'s. (Dargis) 'FREEDOMLAND' (R, 113 minutes) This inept, lethally dull drama directed by Joe Roth and written by Richard Price, from his novel, involves a white child who may have gone missing in a New Jersey public housing complex, where the residents are all black. A loud Samuel L. Jackson and a miscast Julianne Moore star. (Dargis) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) * 'LOVE' (No rating, 93 minutes) Cool, mysterious and defiantly foreign, ''Love'' plays out on the immigrant fringes of an indifferent New York City. A Yugoslavian hit man, his German ex-wife and her cop boyfriend form a love triangle that propels a cosmopolitan cast into a violent game of cat and mouse. In these bleak, isolated neighborhoods, exquisitely shot by the Serbian cinematographer Vladimir Subotic, love and politics are inseparable and the gleam of Manhattan is a million miles away. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) 'PINK PANTHER' (PG, 92 minutes) Steve Martin steps into the shoes of Peter Sellers in this intermittently witty revival of a vintage comedy franchise. Though finely honed, Mr. Martin's portrayal of the idiotic French police inspector Jacques Clouseau can't match Sellers's viscerally funny one. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the movie rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'A YEAR WITHOUT LOVE' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Spanish) Anahí Berneri's debut film recounts in uncomfortable close-up the day-to-day activities of a youngish gay writer from Buenos Aires afflicted with AIDS, who becomes involved in S-and-M. Based on the diaries of the real Pablo Peréz (he is also co-writer of the script), the film reveals rare insight into the endurance and treatment of illness, but is never fully arresting. (Laura Kern) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year. This weekend's films include Paul Rosdy's ""New World"" (2005), about what was once the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Karen Kramer's ""Ballad of Greenwich Village"" (2005), an affectionate profile of a neighborhood. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10.

Clearview Cinema, 62nd Street and Broadway, (877) 966-5566; $10. (Gates) JOSEPHINE BAKER ON FILM (Through Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image celebrates Baker's centennial with a 10-day retrospective of her films. This weekend's features include Marc Allégret's ''Zouzou'' (1934), the story of a poor girl who wants to be a star; ''Siren of the Tropics'' (1927), Baker's first starring role, as a stowaway on an ocean liner; and ''Princess Tam Tam'' (1935), a ''Pygmalion''-style comedy about a shepherdess. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) MAN IN THE DUNES: DISCOVERING HIROSHI TESHIGAHARA (Through March 19) BAMcinématek's tribute to Teshigahara (1927-2001), the artist, filmmaker and master flower arranger, begins today with a weeklong run of ''Antonio Gaudí'' (1984), his documentary about the architect of the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) RICHARD PRYOR TRIBUTE (Through Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image is honoring Pryor (1940-2005) this weekend. ''Which Way Is Up?'' (1977), Michael Schultz's adaptation of ''The Seduction of Mimi,'' will be shown tomorrow night, with a personal appearance by Lonette McKee, Mr. Pryor's co-star in the film. On Sunday night, the comedian and writer Paul Mooney will present highlights from ''The Richard Pryor Show'' (1977, NBC), Mr. Pryor's very short-lived television series. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $12.

(Laura Sinagra) BELLE & SEBASTIAN, THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS (Thursday) The deceptively gentle Scottish rock of Belle and Sebastian continues to find the exquisite balance between loll and lash. The New Pornographers are a revved-up Vancouver outfit whose smart constructions and tight power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until Neko Case's voice cuts through like a triumphant skywriter. 8:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $30 (sold out). (Sinagra) BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Thursday) Boasting zero members from Brazil and only one girl (the multilingual surrealist jazz singer Sabina Sciubba), this downtown quartet plays its erotic, electronica-inflected reggae and bossa novas on keyboards, computers, bass and drums. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20.. (Sinagra) GEORGE CLINTON & THE P-FUNK ALLSTARS (Tuesday) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. The band is large enough to be a party all on its own, with ranks of guitarists, singers, horn players and keyboardists to pump out songs that encompass decades of American musical history. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, $37.50; $42 at the door.

(Sinagra) DONALD FAGEN (Wednesday) Steely Dan's jaded-jazz rocker Donald Fagen tours in support of his first solo record since 1993, ''Morph the Cat'' (Reprise), on which, among other things, he focuses his recognizable leer on a hot airport security babe. 8 p.m., State Theater, 15 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick, N.J., (732) 246-7469; $45 to $65.

(Sinagra) HOWE GELB (Tomorrow) Howe Gelb, the songwriter at the core of Giant Sand, applies his scratchy voice to songs that can sound quiet and offhand or go lurching and twanging toward chaos. 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $12 . (Pareles) JOHN HAMMOND (Thursday) The rural blues tradition of polyrhythmic fingerpicking and casually revealing vocals is being upheld by revivalists like John Hammond, who has been playing country blues since the 1960's .

(Pareles) SARAH HARMER (Wednesday) In the tradition of emotionally astute Canadian singer-songwriters, Sarah Harmer applies her sharp voice to bluegrass-tinged pop and wistful folk. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, SoHo, (212) 941-8100; $15 in advance, $18 at the door.

(Sinagra) BILLY JOEL (Tomorrow, Monday, and Thursday) Last year, the iconic piano man released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real, if prickly, confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50. (Sinagra) TED LEO & THE PHARMACISTS (Thursday) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice.

(Pareles) RJD2, ACEYALONE, BUSDRIVER (Sunday) Representing an offshoot of the crate-digging DJ tradition exemplified in the 1990's by the likes of DJ Shadow, RJD2 takes a cinematic approach.

(Stephen Holden) BABY JANE DEXTER (Tomorrow) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; cover, $20, with a $15 minimum.

(Chinen) * CACHAO (Tuesday and Wednesday) In the 1940's, Israel Lopez, known as Cachao, helped define modern Cuban music, especially with respect to the bass; now in his 80's, he has wisdom to match his panache, as he'll demonstrate here with a 10-piece band. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $45 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Amato Opera's reputation is that it conveys the spirit of, and a love for, Italian opera, though the full impact is impossible to achieve in a 102-seat theater with a cast that changes at every performance. And against the odds, all the principals at a recent performance of ''Aida'' managed to make it through to the end, demonstrating a true love of the piece if not always of the pitch. It's a unique experience. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) 'DARKLING' (Sunday through Tuesday, and Thursday) American Opera Projects' latest venture is a three-week run of this multimedia opera, which brings together extremely diverse composers -- Lee Hoiby and Stefan Weisman -- and performers, from singers to the alternative Flux Quartet. The subject: the Holocaust. Tuesday is opening night. Sunday afternoon at 3; Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights at 8; East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $45.(Midgette) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tonight and Tuesday) It's tempting to say that ''Forza'' has the most numbingly ludicrous libretto of any Verdi opera, but with such stiff competition, who can truly say? Giancarlo del Monaco's drab staging, first seen in 1996 and hidden away in storage since then, offers little help, but the Met does have a vocally solid cast, with Deborah Voigt, Salvatore Licitra and Mark Delavan. Gianandrea Noseda conducts. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175.(Allan Kozinn) 'LAKMÉ' (Sunday) Delibes's ''Lakmé'' is best known for the coloratura soprano tour-de-force aria ''The Bell Song'' and an utterly dreamy duet for soprano and mezzo-soprano. But these days audiences do not often get to hear this once-popular opera complete. So it's good news for opera buffs that Eve Queler, a tireless champion of neglected works, will conduct a concert performance with the Opera Orchestra of New York. Eglise Gutiérrez, a young Cuban-born soprano whose career is taking off, sings the title role, with a cast that includes a young Armenian tenor, Yeghishe Manucharyan, and the veteran bass James Morris. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $125. (Anthony Tommasini) 'ROMÉO ET JULIETTE' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The big news from the Met's new production of this Gounod opera is the French coloratura soprano Natalie Dessay. Singing with uncanny agility and lyrical elegance, she touchingly embodies the tragically impulsive young Juliette. The tenor Ramón Vargas, though a stiff actor, delivers a vocally impassioned Roméo. Guy Joosten's production evokes the look of Renaissance Italy, though with surreal touches and too much heavy-handed imagery of eternal love amid the starry cosmos. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 remaining tickets tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini) 'SAMSON ET DALILA' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The Met's color-coded production of this Saint-Saëns opera, by Elijah Moshinsky, takes on Olga Borodina as Dalila.

(Holland) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) A weekly presenter of chamber music concerts, this floating concert hall also offers great views of Lower Manhattan.

This weekend, Mr. Peskanov and company play music by Mozart, Schubert, Shostakovich and Beethoven. Thursday, Allison Eldredge (cello) and Max Levinson (piano) perform Beethoven, Bartok and others. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Jeremy Eichler) ALFRED BRENDEL (Monday) As this eminent Austrian pianist settles into his golden years, he seems quite content to focus on the Viennese Classical works that have been the core of his repertory. For his Carnegie recital he offers Schubert's lengthy and reflective late Sonata in G (D. 894), and Mozart's brooding Fantasy in C minor and melancholic Rondo in A minor. But if this sounds rather pensive, fear not: he will bracket these works with performances of two high-spirited and witty Haydn sonatas. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Tommasini) BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) The news is Michael Christie, the new music director of an orchestra that established a tradition of hot young music directors with Robert Spano. Mr. Christie gets raves from people who have encountered him; his opening concert includes the world premiere of a new ''Fanfare'' written for the event by John Corigliano, and Orff's ''Carmina Burana,'' as well as works by Stravinsky and Philip Glass. 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60. (Midgette) CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA (Tomorrow) Like so many of his piano-playing colleagues, Andras Schiff takes up conducting as well in this all-Mozart program. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Holland) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight and Sunday) The acclaimed pianist Angela Hewitt is known above all for Bach and French music; her programs with the Chamber Music Society this weekend focus on the French, with pieces ranging from a Ravel trio to the Franck quintet. She also joins the young German cellist Daniel Müller-Schott for the Debussy cello sonata. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49 (Midgette). JERUSALEM CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Wednesday and Thursday) Chamber music festivals, increasingly, are ensembles that come together for an intense couple of weeks and then go on the road. The pianist Elena Bashkirova founded this one in 1998, and it's been an occasional guest at Carnegie Hall, where this year its programs include Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony and a healthy admixture of Mozart. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35 to $40. (Midgette) I MUSICI (Sunday) This venerable Italian orchestra offers an all-Mozart program that includes the ''Serenata Notturna,'' the Piano Concerto No. 14 in E flat with Stephen Hough, the Divertimento in D (K. 136) and ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.'' 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $56. (Kozinn) LOCRIAN CHAMBER PLAYERS (Tonight) This ensemble's rule is that it performs only works written in the last decade. Included this time are Lukas Foss's String Quartet No. 5 and ''For Toru,'' as well as works by Michael Daugherty, David Shohl and David Macdonald. 8, Riverside Church, 10th-floor performance space, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (718) 458-4864; free. (Kozinn) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) Robert Spano brings his energy and imagination to a New York Philharmonic program including Bartok, Harbison and Bernstein and featuring the soprano Dawn Upshaw. 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94. (Holland) NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY (Sunday) Paul Haas conducts ''The Other Rainbow'' by Roger Zare and Stravinsky's challenging ''Rite of Spring.'' 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $7 to $55. (Holland) PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) For all reports, Christoph Eschenbach, now in his third season as music director, has had a shaky relationship with the Philadelphia players. Still, he is a comprehensive musician, and the orchestra is capable of doing great work with him. Longtime fans of this illustrious orchestra should be curious to hear this program, with the New York premiere of Esa-Pekka Salonen's ''Insomnia'' and Beethoven's ''Pastoral'' Symphony. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $99. (Tommasini) * POMERIUM (Sunday) Alexander Blachly's early-music choir is a mainstay of the Music Before 1800 series, and of early-music life in New York generally. Its program this time centers on Ockeghem, and features his Missa ''L'Homme Armé,'' as well as works by Dufay, Binchois and Busnois. 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266; $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for students and 62+. (Kozinn) DAVID ROBERTSON YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT (Tomorrow) In addition to presenting concerts, Carnegie Hall also runs numerous professional training workshops every year. This week, the conductor David Robertson and his colleagues have been working intensively with young musicians from around the country to prepare them in a program of challenging scores by Messiaen (''Sept Haïkaï'' and ''Oiseaux Exotiques'') and Varèse (''Déserts''). Under Mr. Robertson's baton, the workshop participants will show what they've learned. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15. (Eichler) * JORDI SAVALL (Thursday) If you aren't convinced of the persuasive power of the viola da gamba, then you probably haven't heard Jordi Savall play it. There will be several opportunities this season, starting with this recital of works by Sainte-Colombe, Marais, Bach, Hume, Ferrabosco and others. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38. (Kozinn) TAKACS QUARTET (Tonight) Bartok has long been a specialty of this quartet, which offers the Bartok Second as the centerpiece of a program that opens with Schubert's Quartet in A minor (D. 804) and closes with Mozart's Quintet in C (K. 515), with James Dunham joining to play the extra viola part. 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $44 and $52. (Kozinn) LES VIOLONS DU ROY (Sunday) This spirited chamber orchestra is based in Quebec City and led by the able Canadian conductor Bernard Labadie. And while the group plays on modern instruments, its repertory often leans toward the Baroque. Here, it will perform Jean-Fery Rebel's ''Élémens,'' a suite from Rameau's ''Dardanus'' and arias by Rameau and Gluck. The Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena, a frequent presence in New York in recent weeks, returns to Carnegie as the guest soloist. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42 and $55. (Eichler) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. CARRIE AHERN (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Ahern describes her new ''Red,'' inspired by Margaret Atwood's ''Handmaid's Tale'' and by the clean lines of the performance space, as a ''work of beautiful suffocation.'' Her all-female ensemble includes some of the city's most interesting dance artists. 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Jennifer Dunning) IVY BALDWIN DANCE AND KATE WEARE (Wednesday through March 4) Ms. Baldwin presents ''Gone Missing,'' a dance-theater piece featuring weary travelers lost in a winter forest. Ms. Weare explores bodily impulses and longing in ''Wet Road.'' 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $12 and $20.

(Dunning) * SEAN CURRAN COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) In the inaugural program of this new performing space, Mr. Curran pulls out his inner Irish storyteller and melds it with a practiced choreographic perspective in three works: ''A Short List of Miniature Stories,'' created for the occasion; the lush ''Aria/Apology''; and the wry ''Companion Dances.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200 or www.dnadance.org; $25. (Dunning) DANCE AT DIXON PLACE: 'BODY BLEND' (Tuesday) The program features dance by Angie Fowler, Melanie Maar, Jason Somma and Ashley Wallace, chosen by the curator Isabel Lewis. 8 p.m. Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-0736 or www.dixonplace.org; $12 or T.D.F.; students and 65+, $10. (Dunning) DANCEBRAZIL (Tuesday through Thursday) Two programs explore the rich cultures of Bahia, Brazil, in choreography that merges Afro-Brazilian dance, live music and the martial arts form of capoeira, including a new dance by the company director Jelon Vieira to music by Tuze de Abreu. (Through March 12.) Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 and www.Joyce.org; $42. (Dunning) DANZAHOY (Tonight through Sunday) Employing both tango and the joropo, a traditional Venezuelan dance, Danzahoy brings ''Exodo'' to the Joyce for its first New York appearance in more than 20 years. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $36. (Claudia La Rocco) DRASTIC ACTION (Thursday through Saturday) Aviva Geismar and her company will present new and recent dances that explore group dynamics and communication. They feature a woman in a rocking chair and a mythical creature that is part bird, part snake and part masquerade performer. (Through March 5.) 8:30 p.m., West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 337-9565; $10 and $12. (Dunning) TRAJAL HARRELL AND KAREN BERNARD (Tonight and tomorrow) Chosen by Tere O'Connor, these two choreographers will present a dance that unfolds like a diary (Bernard), and a piece that incorporates postmodern dance, fashion runway moves and vogueing (Harrell). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 11, and www.thekitchen.org.; $10. (Dunning) BILL T. JONES/ARNIE ZANE DANCE COMPANY (Tomorrow) Dance gets a remix in ''Another Evening: I Bow Down,'' featuring old and new work by Mr. Jones, as well as live music and digital manipulations by Daniel Bernard Roumain. 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200; $35 and $45. (La Rocco) JUILLIARD SCHOOL: 'NEW DANCES/NEW MUSIC' (Tonight through Sunday) New dances by Adam Hougland, Jessica Lang and Alan Hineline to new music by Christopher Rouse, Pete M. Wyer and Jerome Begin, conducted by Andrea Quinn. (Through Feb. 26.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $20; $10 (at box office) for students and 65+. (Dunning) * KINGS OF THE DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) While conceptually yet another copy of the Three Tenors, this program, on closer inspection, looks more interesting than that. It offers Angel Corella and Ethan Stiefel of American Ballet Theater, Johan Kobborg of the Royal Ballet and Nikolay Tsiskaridize of the Bolshoi Ballet. There will be new choreography by Christopher Wheeldon, Roland Petit, Nils Christie, Stanton Welch and Tim Rushton, along with solos by Balanchine, Grigorovich, Petipa and Bournonville, and Flemming Flindt's complete ''Lesson,'' in which each ''king'' (except for Mr. Stiefel, with his tender knees) will dance the role of the teacher on successive nights. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.citycenter.org; $35 to $150. (John Rockwell) * REJINA NEJMAN & COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Nejman's ''Velocity of Things,'' in which six characters trapped in a futuristic carnival search desperately for balance in a fast-paced world, won the FringeNYC's 2005 Outstanding Choreography Award. 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $18; $15 for students and 65+; T.D.F. accepted. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday) The winter season ends this weekend. Christopher Wheeldon's ''After the Rain'' can be seen tonight and tomorrow afternoon, when Peter Martins's new ''Friandises'' will also be performed.

(Rockwell) NICHOLASLEICHTER DANCE WITH THE BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Mr. Leichter, long known on small stages for his energetic, multicultural physicality, has choreographed his first opera: Carl Orff's ''Carmina Burana.'' The program, which celebrates Michael Christie's inaugural season as music director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, also includes a world premiere of John Corigliano's ''Fanfare'' and works by Igor Stravinsky and Philip Glass. 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100 or www.bam.org; $20 to $60; students, $10. (Kinetz) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL: HEADLONG DANCE THEATER (Wednesday and Thursday) From Philadelphia, Headlong presents a preview of a new dance based on a short story by I. B. Singer, and the New York premiere of ''Mixed Tape for a Bad Year,'' a suite of short dance and a film that reflects the emotional toll of 12 months of disasters, war and political bitterness. (Through March 5.) 8 p.m. Ailey Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Manhattan (212) 415-5500 and www.92Y.org/harknessfestival; $20; $15 for students and 65+.

(Kinetz) * PAUL TAYLOR (Tuesday through Thursday) Having celebrated a milestone anniversary last year, the Paul Taylor Dance Company begins its ''next 50 years of greatness'' with its annual three-week season at City Center. The opening-night gala with live music is on Tuesday and includes one of the season's two New York premieres, ''Spring Rounds,'' set to Richard Strauss's arrangements of Couperin. The programs otherwise offer the typical mixture of Taylor standards and exotica. Tuesday at 7 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. Through March 19.City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.nycitycenter.org; $15 to $80; some gala seats, especially if dinner is included, are more expensive. (Rockwell) PEGGY SPINA TAP (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Spina celebrates 25 years of performing, choreographing and teaching tap in a program of dances set to music performed live by the Joel Forrester Quartet.

(Dunning) VISION COLLABORATION NIGHTS (Tonight through Sunday) In three different programs, work will be presented by 10 modern-dance choreographers set to live music by their collaborators, ending with an improv jam featuring most of the dancers. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 5 p.m., 14th Street Y Theater, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 696-6681 or www.visionfestival.org; $20. (Dunning) REGGIE WILSON/FIST & HEEL PERFORMANCE GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Wilson and his superb musicians and dancers create a world that fuses the cultural traditions of the black American South, urban America, Africa and the Caribbean, this time in ''The Tale: Npinpee Nckutchie and the Tail of the Golden Dek,'' a new work that explores sexual attraction. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Galleries: Uptown Robert S. Neuman: 'Fifty Years' With good-humored generosity and a skillful, sensuous touch, Mr. Neuman has painted his way through several different genres over the course of his five-decade career, including Abstract Expressionism, geometric formalism, funky allegorical narrative and painterly landscapes that mourn the losses of the American Indians. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through March 4. (Ken Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Caitlin Atkinson: 'Chapters' Comical and touching staged photographs portray the artist herself in moments of anxiety and disappointment: contemplating a dish of lasagna she burned; apparently abandoned in an empty grocery store parking lot; and starting to disrobe at a nude beach. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through March 4. (Johnson) Chuck Close, Annie Leibovitz, Vik Muniz: 'Inventive Fashion Photographs' Photographs of the silhouettes of fashion models, shaped in bent wire and based on fashion photographs by Vik Muniz; daguerreotype pictures of a naked Kate Moss; and fashion spreads by Annie Leibovitz based on ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Danziger, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 629-6778, through March 4. (Johnson) Mimi Smith: 'Drawings from the 60's to the Present' Known for witty feminist sculptures based on women's clothing, Ms. Smith here presents drawings sampling her five-decade career, including a large, three-dimensional paper house covered with fine writing protesting environmental pollution and recent sets of finely made images of shoes and underwear representing stages in a woman's life from infancy to old age. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, through March 4. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo 'Space Boomerang' This darkly theatrical show includes sculptures like Cubist bathtubs by Mike Bouchet; a bicycle with endlessly spinning wheels by Jonathan Monk; a Minimalist wall sculpture dented on purpose by Bruno Peinado; a wall that intermittently vibrates violently by Loris Gréaud; a magical light and smoke sculpture by Ann Veronica Janssens; a video documenting Gianni Motti's walk through a particle accelerator; a motorcycle immersed in the wax of burning candles by Mark Handforth; and a long, sleek wall of black plastic-shaded lights by Lang/Baumann. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through March 9. (Johnson) Other Galleries Joe Bradley: 'Kurgan Waves' Large, blocky men assembled from flimsy, brusquely painted canvases seem to have convened for a mysterious tribal ritual in Mr. Bradley's sharp sendup of Minimalist orthodoxy. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, between Hester and Canal Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, through March 4. (Johnson) * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) 'Site 92' The second exhibition in this nonprofit gallery's impressive big, new space presents site-specific works by more than 25 artists. Highlights includes a colorful column of hovering butterflies made of candy wrappers by Luisa Caldwell; fanciful architectural elements painted on the wall by Amy Yoes; people imitating the sounds of pigeons in an audio-video work by Beth Krebs; and, by Virginia Poundstone, a tableau representing a satellite that has crashed in the jungle. Smack Mellon, 92 Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 834-8761, through March 5. (Johnson) Last Chance * HOME STORIES: AN INSIDE LOOK AT SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES IN AUSTRIA Departing from standard-issue architectural exhibitions with a slightly too clever design, this show of 21 recent houses includes portraits of their inhabitants and poster-size sheets free for the taking that function as both labels and catalog. The totality feels like a collaboration among Bernd and Hilla Becher, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and the contemporary photographer of your choice, but it makes an excellent case for the vitality of Austrian architecture. Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300: closes tomorrow. (Smith) 'I Love My Scene' This intriguing and puzzling exhibition organized by José Freire, director of Team Gallery, includes photographs of movie stars and models by Cecil Beaton; pictures of murder and accident victims by Weegee; faux-antique architectural studies drawn by Pablo Bronstein; and large sculptures by Keith Sonnier, Banks Violette and Lothar Hempel. Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 752-2929; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) EIRIK JOHNSON: 'BORDERLANDS' Small, serendipitous encounters in the landscape are the subjects of Eirik Johnson's large color photographs: junk hung picturesquely on a wire fence along a shore; a red sweater splayed between trees in a woods; a fragile, impromptu bridge of skinny logs laid across a creek. In one photograph, a huge crumple of grayish fabric plopped on grass and maybe used as a shelter has the imposing look of a sculptural boulder. There are no control-freak setups here. Rather, it seems that Mr. Johnson helps the camera make its own discoveries, often with poetic results. Yossi Milo Gallery, 525 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-0370; closes tomorrow. (Glueck) * ZILVINAS KEMPINAS In contrasting works, this artist uses videotape to create one environment and record another. The resulting Op Art installation and a record of a bike ride through Times Square conspire; sensory overload, both retinal and aural, ensues, as does a surprising application of the less-is-more principle. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3455; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'Speak: Nine Cartoonists' Original drawings and studies by nine of the best comic-book artists in the business, including R. Crumb, Daniel Clowes, Gary Panter, Chris Ware and Art Spiegelman. Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 647-7778; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * BEC STUPAK/HONEYGUN LABS: 'RADICAL EARTH MAGIC FLOWER' This ambitious gallery debut centers on a blind remake of Jack Smith's 1963 orgiastic ode to transvestism and Hollywood camp, ''Flaming Creatures,'' projected on a wall opposite the original, with Ms. Stupak's subtitlelike storyboards appearing in between. The contrast is mutually enhancing up to a point; the Stupak provides color and detail missing from the blurry, black-and-white Smith film, but the earlier effort still carries the day. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * TRIFECTA This energetic curatorial face-off consists of three exhibitions devoted to young artists (nearly 20 in all), organized by the gallery's owner, Becky Smith, and her assistants, Esme Watanabe and Erica Samuels. The three groupings progress from minimal to hyper-real, with Ms. Watanabe's selection, which lands somewhere in the middle, edging out those of her colleagues. Sara VanDerBeek's set-up photographs, which suggest a Surrealist's garret, are a find. Bellwether, 194 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-5959; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Johannes Wohnseifer: 'New Alphabet' Paintings and sculptures in several different styles by this brainy young German conceptualist obscurely explore semiotics relating to the industrial, military, political and popular entertainment spheres. He has a keen sense of design, and the sculptures made of pieces of shiny bent metal and thick felt are extremely elegant. But over all, his project looks like that of an academic theory wonk. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-7335; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)"

Broadway 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). (On Tuesday, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.) Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater; 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'ANTON' It is one thing to write a play about Anton Chekhov's last four years, quite another to attempt the master's style, then produce and direct it and portray the title character. Though Pierre van der Spuy's reach far exceeds his grasp, he deserves some credit for trying (2:15). Greenwich Street Theater, 547 Greenwich Street, between Charlton and Vandam Streets, South Village; (212) 352-3101.(Andrea Stevens) *'THE END OF REALITY' Violence isn't pretty in the listless but eventful world of Richard Maxwell's hypnotic new play. It's not ugly, either. In this latest work from the king of affecting disaffection, violence doesn't so much explode as drip, like water from a leaky faucet, into the lives of lonely, hapless security guards. Mr. Maxwell's most eloquent statement to date about the blurring of despair and apathy in American lives (1:40). The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793. (Brantley) 'GONER' The president is shot, and the world's worst doctors get the job of trying to save him in this very funny bit of sketch comedy disguised as a play. Bad taste seems not to be an issue for the author, Brian Parks, but most of the lunacy is inspired enough that you can forgive the insensitivity (1:15). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'HOUSE OF DESIRE' This 300-year-old farce, written by a nun, mostly proves that Baroque women were just as capable as Baroque men of producing forgettable plays. It's sometimes fun watching the energetic young actors trying to breathe life into it, though, especially during a smashing sword fight conducted in semi-darkness (2:10). Storm Theater, 145 West 46th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'MAJOR BARBARA' George Bernard Shaw's polemic against the military-industrial complex and organized religion is still timely 100 years later, and though the director Brooke O'Harra's Kabuki-tinged version lands on the mark and misses it about equally, there is something true and real about the production that is worth seeing (2:35). La MaMa Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710. (Stevens) 'WHAT THEN' Even if Rinne Groff's playful play about environmental disaster is occasionally labored, there's never any doubt that there's an active, lively intelligence at work (1:30). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM' The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley) 'THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY' Sounds like Shakespeare, bleeds like a ''Friday the 13th'' movie. Authorship of this 400-year-old play is uncertain, but the Red Bull Theater's interpretation, adapted and directed by Jesse Berger, is definitive, anchored by a dynamite performance by Matthew Rauch as a fellow bent on avenging his love's death in a dukedom full of degenerates (2:05). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE' (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott) 'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true-story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western college bastkeball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Nathan Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) 'TRISTAN & ISOLDE' (PG-13, 125 minutes) The lovers of Celtic mythology, Arthurian legend and Wagnerian libretto fall for each other far from the violent, Dark Ages machinations plaguing their two warring peoples. A pleasant entertainment from the director Kevin Reynolds that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more. (Dargis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) * 'WHEN THE SEA RISES' (No rating, 89 minutes, in French) Graced with a magnetic lead performance by Yolande Moreau, this French-Belgian movie is a serious romantic comedy with surreal touches that follows the road tour of a middle-aged solo comedian through the small towns of northern France.(Holden) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Feb. 12) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land.

CYRO BAPTISTA & BEAT THE DONKEY, LUMINESCENT ORCHESTRII (Tomorrow) Led by the percussionist Cyro Baptista, who has collaborated on some of the world-beat forays of Paul Simon and Sting, the ensemble Beat the Donkey plays ecumenical music with a Brazilian flavor, integrating samba, forró and maracatu as well as jazz, rock and funk. Luminescent Orchestrii makes similar cultural mash-ups with a Balkan base. 8 p.m., Steinhardt Building, Makor, 35 West 67th Street, (212) 415-5500; $15. (Laura Sinagra) BELL ORCHESTRE, CLOGS (Sunday) The Montreal band the Bell Orchestre mixes traditional orchestral sounds with machine atmospherics.

Like-minded associates Clogs also play. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE (Thursday) This Canadian collective makes heartbreak music that sounds like a fuzzy, drunken party. Some prefer its diffuse anthemic feints to the straight-up anthems of its countrymen Arcade Fire. Members have included the Stars' Evan Cranley, Metric's Emily Haines and the multitalented singer-songwriter Leslie Feist. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $25. (Sinagra) CAKE, TEGAN AND SARA, GOGOL BORDELLO, EUGENE MIRMAN (Tonight) The Sacramento-based alt-rock band Cake uses its Unlimited Sunshine Tour as a chance to perform with musicians its members admire. This time out they asked the Canadian folk-pop twins Tegan and Sara, as well as the manic Gypsy punkers Gogol Bordello. The music-loving hipster comedian Eugene Mirman will tie it all together. 7:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, (212) 485-1534; $34. (Sinagra) CALEXICO (Tuesday) Calexico plays desert rock bathed in pedal-steel mystery and orchestral ambience. Lately the group has collaborated with the quiescent folk-rocker Iron and Wine (a k a Sam Beam), striking a balance that made it sound more intimate and him more expansive. The group plays without him this weekend but is joined by the multi-instrumentalist Rob Burger. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sinagra) EDITORS (Tonight and Tomorrow) Another in the line of British post-punk bands joining the dark, danceable Joy Division parade, the Editors have strong singles, like the propulsive ''Munich,'' but none that top the best from its closest sonic cousin, Interpol. Tonight at 8, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door (sold out). Tomorrow at 11 p.m., the Annex, 152 Orchard Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side; $10 (sold out). (Sinagra) ELEPHANT MAN (Tonight) Nicknamed Energy God, the Jamaican D.J. Elephant Man has been one of the dancehall artists most successful in terms of crossing over to the hip-hop scene, lending his gruff, kinetic voice to so many rap and R&B tracks that at times it has felt like overkill. He appears here at a party put on by Hot 97's Angie Martinez and DJ Enuff. 9 p.m., Exit, 610 West 56th Street; free to all on guest list before midnight, $25 after. Call (212) 582-8282 for details.

(Sinagra) BILLY JOEL (Monday and Thursday) The iconic piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50. (Sinagra) HOWARD JONES (Monday) The 80's synth-pop hitmaker behind the giddily uplifting ''New Song'' and the vaguely spooky rouser ''Things Can Only Get Better'' scored big by being more human than Thomas Dolby and more optimistic than the Fixx. 7 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $25. (Sinagra) KARSH KALE & REALIZE LIVE FEATURING VISHAL VAID, GLOBESONIC SOUND SYSTEM (Tonight) The tabla player Karsh Kale has branched out into production, exploring East-meets-West beat culture. The vocalist and harmonium player Vishal Vaid draws his inspiration from South Asian ghazal, modally sung improvisatory love poetry. Globesonic Sound System spins a dance party at 12:30. 9, Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $18. (Sinagra) CURT KIRKWOOD (Tonight) In the Meat Puppets, the 80's band he led with his brother Cris, Curt Kirkwood proved himself a punk guitar mystic, integrating punk and classic rock with a lolling profundity revered by Kurt Cobain. 11 p.m., the Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; $10. (Sinagra) LANGHORNE SLIM (Tonight) With an old-timey shtick and indie-rock influences, this urban-folk songwriter helps young scenesters cleanse the sonic palette after too many nights of beeps and blare. 11:30, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra) COLIN MELOY AND LAURA VEIRS (Thursday) The sharp-voiced frontman of the Decemberists, Colin Meloy will soon release some of his college band Tarkio's material, the strength of which proves he's always been a master tunesmith inclined toward earnest literary name-checking. He plays solo this time, sharing the bill with another evocative songwriter, the ethereal but edgy Laura Veirs. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536; $23.50. (Sinagra) MF DOOM, LITTLE BROTHER (Thursday) MF Doom is a purveyor of imaginative raps that glower and shimmer, creating a sense of poetic pain. Little Brother is a soul-grounded rap group from Durham, N.C., that forgoes Southern crunk in favor of blending the free-form experimentation of OutKast with the kind of jazzy tracks that characterized the East Coast hip-hop of the mid-90's. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com; $33.

(Sinagra) R. STEVIE MOORE, ODAWAS (Tonight) The rarely seen R. Stevie Moore plays denatured California-flavored pop. Odawas makes arty folk-rock that sounds as if it's being strummed at a campfire on a desert moon, against the baying of mechanical wolves. 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10. (Sinagra) THE ROLLING STONES, METRIC (Tonight) The Stones' newest album is their most stripped-down in 20 years. And as the 62-year-old sexpot Mick Jagger shouts ''Sweet Neo Con'' from stadium stages, the Stones even seem politically relevant. Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Haines, Metric finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Haines's shuddering alto functions as both a weapon and a come-on. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $454.50. (Sinagra) LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Tonight) Led by the singers Allyssa Lamb and Emily Hurst, this band mixes musicians from the United States, France and Colombia, who mine their Latin heritage in the performance of boleros, cha-chas, cumbias, huaynos and cowboy songs. 11, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $10.

(Jon Pareles) RICKY SKAGGS & KENTUCKY THUNDER (Sunday) Ricky Skaggs's fingers fly over just about anything with frets, especially the mandolin; he's no slouch on the fiddle, either, and he has the high tenor voice of a singer steeped in bluegrass. He did well in the Nashville mainstream in the 1980's, working as a producer and making a hit on his own with ''Country Boy'' in 1984. He has recently returned to more traditional Southern gospel and bluegrass. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Pareles) LUCIANA SOUZA (Monday) The jazzy singer Luciana Souza performs her new, poetry-inspired, Brazilian-inflected songs as a duo with Romero Lubambo, and with a quartet featuring guitar, bass and drums. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sinagra) LEWIS TAYLOR (Thursday) To call the British songwriter Lewis Taylor neo-soul is to shortchange an arduous history. He has been recording throwback psych-soul odes to love and pain since the 80's, with far less recognition than he is entitled to. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sinagra) THREE FLOORS OF SKA (Tonight) Tonight the Knitting Factory is filled with ska bands of many persuasions, from the Toasters, the New York Ska Jazz Ensemble, Go Jimmy Go and Eastern Standard Time to the Rotterdam Ska Jazz Foundation, the Bluebeats, the Rudie Crew, Hub City, Bigger Thomas, Bombtown and the Vicars. 7 , 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) THE DEREK TRUCKS BAND (Sunday) Derek Trucks, the nephew of the Allman Brothers Band's drummer Butch Trucks, is now a full-time member of his uncle's band and leads his own blues-rocking band between Allman gigs. 7 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com; $35. (Pareles) WE ARE SCIENTISTS, OXFORD COLLAPSE (Tonight) The pointy guitars and firecracker drums of this local band propel the tremulous pleas of Keith Murray into a full-on lust panic. Where similar bands can sound too studied, We Are Scientists makes its precision seem inspired. The trio Oxford Collapse's shaggy art-rock recalls that of acerbic forebears like the Embarrassment. 9, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10 in advance, $12 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra) JAH WOBBLE (Thursday) Once the bassist for Public Image Ltd., he has built a solo career on imaginative collaborations and solo work that mines global rhythms and traditions for answers to spiritual questions. 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $19.50. (Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, $15 minimum. (Stephen Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) 'SINGING ASTAIRE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) This smart, airy revue, which pays tribute to Fred Astaire, has returned, featuring Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. 5:30 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; $30, with a $10 minimum. (Holden) * ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, Tuesday through Thursday) Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, Ms. Stritch weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue about her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $125; dinner, required, is served at 6:30. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. MICHAËL ATTIAS AND RENKU + 2 (Monday) As on the recent album ''Renku'' (Playscape), the saxophonist Michaël Attias embellishes compositional miniatures with help from the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Satoshi Takeishi.

(Chinen) HENRY BUTLER (Tonight) New Orleans has turned out more than a few great jazz pianists, Mr. Butler among them; this solo concert should be a good showcase for his style, powerfully and persuasively rooted in the blues. 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $45. (Chinen) DON BYRON'S IVEY-DIVEY (Monday) This trio -- Mr. Byron on clarinet and tenor saxophone, Jason Moran on piano, and Billy Hart on drums -- pays homage, directly and obliquely, to a 1946 recording session featuring Lester Young, Nat King Cole and Buddy Rich. Results range from the sparsely poetic to the blusteringly emphatic, but the group's imaginative energies never ebb. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $25. (Chinen) ROY CAMPBELL'S PYRAMID TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Campbell, a trumpeter ensconced in free-jazz circles, uses this group to engage in improvisation from the perspective of global folk culture; he has the ideal collaborators in William Parker, on bass and assorted wind instruments, and Hamid Drake, on drums and percussion. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) BILL CHARLAP TRIO (Wednesday through Jan. 29) Bright and breezy yet unfailingly precise, Mr. Charlap, the pianist, has come to exemplify jazz's modern mainstream. So has his working trio, which keeps a Tin Pan Alley repertory percolating in the present tense. 8 and 10 p.m. with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50 and $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) ANDREW D'ANGELO'S I WILL SURVIVE (Tonight) Mr. D'Angelo, an expressive and often entertainingly frenetic multi-reedist, joins forces with the Norwegian tenor saxophonist Kjetil Moster, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Jim Black. 9 and 10:30, Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762; no cover. (Chinen) E.S.T. (Through Sunday) The initials stand for Esbjörn Svensson Trio, a popular acoustic jazz-crossover group from Sweden; taking its lead from Mr. Svensson's piano, the ensemble favors somber harmonies and skittering electronic textures. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen) * HENRY GRIMES AND ROSWELL RUDD (Tomorrow) The bassist Henry Grimes and the trombonist Roswell Rudd were fellow travelers in jazz's 1960's avant-garde, though they followed separate career paths in the ensuing years, Mr. Rudd plunging into obscurity (in the Catskills) and Mr. Grimes into oblivion (in California). Both have been back on the scene and making up for lost time; this duo engagement should evoke some historical echoes but resist the tug of nostalgia. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $20 each set; $35 for both sets. (Chinen) CURTIS HASSELBRING'S BTH (Wednesday) Mr. Hasselbring, a trombonist and guitarist with a mischievous sense of humor, introduces a promising ensemble with a typically inscrutable title; his bandmates are Shane Endsley on trumpet, Andrew D'Angelo on alto saxophone, Trevor Dunn on bass and Ches Smith on drums. 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8.

(Chinen) LUCIANA SOUZA QUARTET AND BRAZILIAN DUOS (Monday) Ms. Souza, an exceptional singer originally from São Paolo, divides her attention between these two ensemble settings, rarely presenting them in tandem. Her quartet interprets jazz standards as well as poems by Pablo Neruda, Elizabeth Bishop and others (with music composed by Ms. Souza); her Brazilian Duos project showcases an intimate and highly intelligent dialogue with Romero Lubambo, another transplanted Brazilian, on acoustic guitar. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) CHARLES TOLLIVER BIG BAND (Wednesday through Jan. 28) Mr. Tolliver leads an upgraded edition of his acclaimed orchestra of the 1970's; among the top-shelf talent involved are the saxophonists Billy Harper and Craig Handy, the trombonist Clark Gayton, the drummer Victor Lewis and the pianist John Hicks. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) TONE COLLECTOR (Sunday) The tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Jeff Davis make up this experimental acoustic threesome, which released a bristling debut last year on Norway's Jazzaway label; they're joined here by a fellow traveler, Ben Gerstein, on trombone. 8 and 9:30 p.m., BAR4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, www.bar4.net; cover, $5.(Chinen) JEFF (TAIN) WATTS SHOW (Through Sunday) Mr. Watts, a drummer whose locomotive drive is matched only by his attunement to the dynamics of a group, leads one consisting of the tenor saxophonist Marcus Strickland, the pianist Lawrence Fields and the bassist Eric Revis. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AINADAMAR' (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) The exuberant, genre-bending music of the Argentinean-born composer Osvaldo Golijov is the focus of a monthlong festival at Lincoln Center. It starts this week with the New York premiere of his lushly scored flamenco opera ''Ainadamar'' (''Fountain of Tears''), loosely based on the life and legacy of the Spanish writer Federico García Lorca. Peter Sellars directs the production, with Dawn Upshaw, Kelley O'Connor and Jessica Rivera in the principal roles. Miguel Harth-Bedoya conducts. Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $65. (Jeremy Eichler) 'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' (Thursday) Vincent La Selva can either break your heart or make you want to wring his neck: why on earth is a conductor this good, of a certain age, conducting a free performance at an Upper West Side church rather than at the Met? Well, whatever the reason (and there are reasons), lovers of Verdi can go hear him and his cast of little-knowns -- often surprisingly good -- with relish. 7:30 p.m., Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, West End Avenue at 86th Street, (212) 245-8837. (Anne Midgette) Bronx Opera (Tomorrow, Sunday) There are some -- O.K., maybe it's just me -- who consider Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' the perfect opera: a wrenching story, spectacular vocal and ensemble music, and it all clocks in at about 50 minutes. The enterprising Bronx Opera has paired this story of royal passion and supernatural mischief with Chabrier's ''Incomplete Education,'' a light piece about a young newlywed's search for information on how to proceed. 2 p.m., Heckscher Theater, El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (718) 960-8833; $20 to $35. (Allan Kozinn) 'COSÌ FAN TUTTE' (Wednesday) This is the ultimate ensemble opera, and the Met's revival of its sunny and simple 1996 production this fall was an impressive effort from a young, attractive and gifted cast. ''Così'' returns with that cast almost intact. The bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties takes the place of Barbara Frittoli as Fiordiligi. The engaging mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena again sings her sister Dorabella. The lyric tenor Paul Groves (taking the place of Matthew Polenzani) and the robust baritone Mariusz Kwiecien portray the young men who cruelly test the fidelity of the two sisters. The veteran baritone Thomas Allen sings the jaded bachelor Don Alfonso. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini) 'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' (Thursday) Franco Alfano's almost-forgotten ''Cyrano'' is musically not much of an opera. But this 1936 work does provide a meaty role for the ageless tenor Plácido Domingo, who gave a vocally fervent and poignant portrayal of Cyrano, the fearless and noble guardsman cursed with an absurdly huge nose, when the production was introduced last season. It returns for six performances, with Mr. Domingo and a strong cast starting Thursday night. Francesca Zambello's production is stylish, handsome and effective. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Tommasini) 'DESPERATELY SEEKING THAÏS' (Thursday) This conceptual take on Massenet's ''Thaïs'' is worth a look if only to check out the silent film, with the golden-age soprano Mary Garden, that will run along with the live musical excerpts provided by the latest incarnation of L'Opéra Français de New York. 8 p.m., French Institute/Alliance Française, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160; $25. (Midgette) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tomorrrow and Tuesday) The Met seems to have a big hit on its hands with Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's fairy-tale opera, which opened last season. But the production is so packed with nonstop stage effects and so peopled with dancers, extras, gargantuan puppets and kitelike animals of every sort that during last season's presentations, the fine musical performances by the conductor James Levine, the Met orchestra and the strong cast took a back seat to the stage show. Maybe the new conductor, Paul Daniel, and the promising new cast that takes over when the production returns tomorrow afternoon (including Mary Dunleavy as Pamina, Eric Cutler as Tamino and Nathan Gunn as Papageno) will fare better. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow; $21 to $80 on Tuesday, with limited tickets. (Tommasini) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) This floating concert hall on the Brooklyn side of the East River offers the intimacy that chamber music needs, as well as a wonderful view of Lower Manhattan through the bay windows behind stage. This weekend the Fine Arts Quartet offers installments of a Shostakovich string quartet cycle -- Nos. 4, 11 and 14 tonight, Nos. 1, 5 and 8 tomorrow and Sunday. Patrycja Piekutowska, a violinist, and Jonahan Yates, a pianist, take over on Thursday with a program of contemporary Polish music, including works by Krzysztof Penderecki, Grazyna Bacewicz, Szymanowski and Lutoslawski. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Kozinn) BERLIN PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday, Thursday) Sir Simon Rattle and the Berliners return to New York with a four-concert series that runs through Jan. 28. Typically one of the highlights of the Carnegie Hall season, this outstanding orchestra gets rolling on Wednesday with Haydn (Symphony No. 86), Schoenberg (Variations for Orchestra) and Strauss (''Ein Heldenleben''). Thursday's program features Mahler's Fourth, with the mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena and the New York premiere of Hanspeter Kyburz's ''Noesis.'' 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $58 to $195. (Eichler) BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Conductors looking for a leg up in their careers have founded orchestras before, but even Ivan Fischer could hardly have imagined that both he and the Budapest Festival Orchestra would have risen so well together. This year's Carnegie Hall appearance for the orchestra is part of the pianist Richard Goode's ''Perspectives'' series, and Mr. Goode will join the orchestra for Bartok's Third Concerto. 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $74. (Midgette) CASSATT STRING QUARTET (Sunday) A striking Eastern European program includes the nocturne from Borodin's second quartet, Dvorak's Quartet in A flat and a piano quintet by the 19th-century Polish composer and pianist Juliusz Zarebski, for which they will be joined by Roman Markowicz. 3 p.m., Kosciuszko Foundation, 15 East 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 734-2130; $25; $20 for students and 65+. (Midgette) 'CHAMBERFEST' (Tonight and tomorrow night) You might think that the Juilliard School has enough to handle with its ambitious continuing musical celebration of its 100th anniversary, not to mention the annual ''Focus'' festival, coming up at the end of the month. But this week the school has also been presenting ''Chamberfest,'' a series of free concerts of diverse works performed by accomplished student musicians. The series ends with concerts tonight (works by Bartok, Schoenberg and Brahms's stormy Piano Quintet in F minor) and tomorrow night (Copland's ''Appalachian Spring,'' Berg's String Quartet and Messiaen's mystical ''Quartet for the End of Time.'') 8, Paul Hall, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406. (Tommasini) COMPOSER PORTRAIT: BONGANI NDODANA (Tonight) The adventurous Miller Theater begins a three-day ''Focus on Africa'' series with a concert featuring works by Bongani Ndodana. Born in Queenstown in 1975, Mr. Ndodana is considered the most prominent young South African composer working today. His works draw both from traditional African and contemporary classical heritages. The soprano Dawn Padmore and the African Exchanges Ensemble will perform, conducted by the composer. 8, Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $20. (Tommasini) GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Guarneri soldiers through another season as the de facto quartet-in-residence at the Metropolitan Museum. Each of the group's six concerts features a Mozart quartet, along with other works. This time around, it's Mozart's Flute Quartet (K. 285), with Carol Wincenc, as well as Schumann's String Quartet No. 3 and Richard Danielpour's String Quartet No. 5. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $50. (Eichler) HOUSTON SYMPHONY (Tuesday) The noted soprano Barbara Bonney joins the Houston Symphony under Hans Graf for a program of Mozart, Shostakovich and the Houston composer Pierre Jalbert. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $87. (Eichler) DMITRI HVOROSTOVSKY (Wednesday) The great silver-maned Russian baritone offers a program of works from his homeland, with opera arias by Borodin, Rachmaninoff and Rubinstein alongside 20th-century popular songs. Supporting him are the Philharmonia of Russia, conducted by Constantine Orbelian; the Cathedral Choral Society; and Style of Five, a Russian folk ensemble. For the perplexed, a preconcert lecture by Maya Pritsker should sort it all out. 8 p.m. (lecture at 6:45), Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $60. (Kozinn) JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) Now that Leonard Slatkin has stepped aside for medical reasons, James DePreist will conduct the student orchestra in Shostakovich's ''Leningrad'' Symphony, as well as in music by two former Juilliard presidents: William Schuman and Peter Mennin. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $10 to $20; free tickets for students and 65+. (Eichler) NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight through Sunday) This year's winter festival is devoted to Mozart -- not surprisingly, given that this year marks the 250th anniversary of his birth and is glutted with Mozart concerts. The second program of the three-week ''Many Faces of Mozart'' event is called ''Mozart and the Voice,'' and includes excerpts from ''The Magic Flute'' and the Requiem. Bernard Labadie conducts. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 3 p.m. at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark; tomorrow night at 8, War Memorial, Memorial Drive, Trenton, (800) 255-3476; $20 to $75. (Midgette) NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS (Tomorrow) Harold Rosenbaum's finely polished chorus specializes in contemporary music, and turns its attention this time to composers who either worked in or were influenced by Minimalism. Included are choral scores by John Adams, David Lang, Julia Wolfe, Michael Gordon, Jeffrey Schanzer and Steve Martland. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $25. (Kozinn) ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE (Sunday and Monday) Sir John Eliot Gardiner and his fine period-instrument orchestra contribute two concerts to this year's Mozart celebration. On Sunday, the Monteverdi Choir joins the ensemble for two great liturgical works that Mozart left unfinished: the Mass in C minor (performed here in the Alois Schmitt edition, touched up by Sir John), and the Requiem. On Monday, the orchestra plays Mozart's three final symphonies, Nos. 39, 40 and 41. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; $35 to $69. Monday at 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center; $56; (212) 721-6500. (Kozinn) RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY (Tomorrow) The composer Anthony Korf and the conductor George Rothman, who founded this innovative orchestra, have championed several inexplicably overlooked 20th-century composers. One is the Romanian-born Frenchman Marius Constant, who died in 2004. Constant is probably fated to be remembered best as the composer of the theme for ''The Twilight Zone.'' But he has a large catalog of strong symphonic works, ballet scores and chamber music. The Riverside will perform his ''103 Regards Dans l'Eau'' on an all-French program with works by Rameau, Ravel and Poulenc. 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 and $45. (Tommasini) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * 'ARISTOPHANES IN BIRDONIA' (Tonight though Sunday night) David Gordon, Valda Setterfield and their Pick Up Performance Company made a big splash two years ago with ''Dancing Henry V'' (reprised last March), and now they are back at St. Mark's Church with another dance-theater piece inspired by a classic drama, in this case ''The Birds.'' Ms. Setterfield plays the playwright, and expect pointed references to contemporary events. 8:30, Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $20.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and Icon,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045. (Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average lifespan was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness was a shot in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. (See above.) (Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Johnson) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored, Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of American Modernists who were active between World Wars I and II. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter) School Zone Martinez Gallery isn't a place; it's a collaborative network of several graffiti artists, two architect-designers, a curator and a dealer. The gallery has taken its graffiti star artists into a public high school for this show, for which, with the help of students, they've covered the walls and ceilings of a classroom with art, alternately brash and delicate, exclamatory and introspective. Martinez Gallery at Julia Richman High School, 317 East 67th Street, Room 222, (212) 619-2149, through Jan. 28 (Cotter) * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman) Galleries: 57th Street * Katy Grannan: 'Mystic Lake' Ms. Grannan continues to make exceptionally intimate photographs of nonprofessional models posing outdoors partly or fully unclothed. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444, through Feb. 4. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Douglas Anderson: 'New Old Robots' Painted in grayed colors and a brushy, cartoonish style that recalls the Ash Can School and 1930's-era Social Realism, Mr. Anderson's comical and mournful small paintings depict old shoes, plumbing, brick walls, junk cars and outmoded industrial machinery in states of dreamlike animation. Blue Mountain, 530 West 25th Street, (646) 486-4730, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD Ms. Butterfield continues to make horses out of weathered branches and scrap steel that are, at best, magically lifelike. In the big one lying down in the gallery, the metal seems just as alive as the illusory animal. Three horses on the Park Avenue median, however, are out of their element -- too delicate to compete with the traffic and the giant buildings, but perhaps because of that, poetically poignant. Edward Thorp, 210 Eleventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets; and on the Park Avenue median between 52nd and 54th Streets; (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Gene Davis: 'Three Decades' A key member of the Washington Color School, which included Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, Davis was known for expansive canvases filled by narrow, vertical colored stripes. The best examples in this show are radiant. Charles Cowles, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 741-8999, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith) 'Head Over Hand: Pushing the Limits of Paint' This well-selected and cohesive 15-artist show presents finely wrought abstract paintings that mix, in most cases, a hedonistic materialism and a spacey, illusory dimension. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) * Guillaume Pinard: 'expresso' Surrealistic, darkly comical black ball-point pen drawings evoke a childlike mind under the influence of Gumby, the Muppets and Japanese anime, and an animated video follows the adventures of two eyeballs with arms and legs through shape-shifting landscapes. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) * JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea (212) 929-7000, through Jan. 28. (Smith) Kyle Staver Influences of Matisse, Bonnard, Marsden Hartley and Milton Avery are conspicuous in Ms. Staver's playful, lushly painterly pictures of people enjoying holiday or domestic pleasures. Her hedonistic verve, humor and feeling for human relationships keep academic stuffiness at bay. Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 675-2656, through Feb. 4. (Johnson) ROBERT STONE Made with a loose, watercolorlike touch, this young British artist's oil-on-canvas paintings depict enigmatic and vaguely comical scenes, like tiny Canadian Mounties having a secret funeral in the woods, or a pair of travelers in oddly mixed costumes posing with a coffin. They are just sweet and peculiar enough to give you pause. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo MARTIN BEAUREGARD, 'SOMNAMBULIC' Old videos of absurdist performances and a new one about meditating and dreaming are eclipsed by two large stuffed-animal sculptures: a sumptuously furry teddy bear the size of a real cub made from a real bearskin, fearsome big claws and all; and a real moose head with majestic, silver-leafed antlers. Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347, through Feb. 4. (Johnson) Richard Tuttle: 'Constructed Relief Paintings' Among the most appealing works in Mr. Tuttle's current retrospective at the Whitney are the eccentrically shaped, single-color paintings from the 1960's. This show presents more of those playfully Minimalist pieces, which, with their wavering outlines and thick sides, look as if they were cut from slabs of colored rubber. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Other Galleries * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty Downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu, and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her death bed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) Tom Folland: 'Death-defying Dervish Gangbuster Rebel' This follower of Paul McCarthy appears in his own ridiculous, hyperactive videos wearing an athletic outfit and a gold, hairless head mask as he manically operates machines designed for destroying paintings. The machines are also on display, including a catapult for throwing a midget dummy version of the artist at paintings. Jack the Pelican, 487 Driggs Avenue, between North 9th and 10th Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 782-0183, through Feb. 5. (Johnson) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot-tall weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) 'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson) Last Chance * SAUL LEITER: 'EARLY COLOR' In their painterly concentration on shadows, reflections, light and color, the distinctive color photographs that the fashion photographer Saul Leiter took in New York in the 1950's reform street photography by concentrating less on pedestrians than on what they might see. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, closes tomorrow. (Smith) * LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6555, closes tomorrow. (Smith)"

Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater. Previews and Openings 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' Opens Sunday. The resourceful Pearl Theater tries to provide an answer to this problem play (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. 'BERNARDA ALBA' Opens Monday. The Tony winner Phylicia Rashad (''A Raisin in the Sun'') plays another formidable matriarchal figure with an iron will in Lincoln Center Theater's musical version of Lorca's ''House of Bernarda Alba.'' Michael John LaChiusa, who already has one musical to his name this season, ''See What I Wanna See,'' contributes music and lyrics (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. 'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' Opens Monday. This artistic hybrid by Wallace Shawn and his brother, Allen, is a drama about the making of an opera that features -- are you still following? -- operatic flashbacks (1:50). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. 'GREY GARDENS' Opens Tuesday. Maybe the biggest question mark of the musical season, this intriguing show is an adaptation of the cult documentary about the eccentric relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'FAMILY SECRETS' Opens Wednesday. Sherry Glaser plays her entire family in this revival of her 1993 autobiographical solo show about moving from the Bronx to Southern California (1:30). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. 'MEASURE FOR PLEASURE' Opens Wednesday. A new play by David Grimm (''Kit Marlowe'') that is part Restoration comedy, part modern sex comedy (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. 'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' Previews start tonight. Opens 9Thursday. It's been almost four decades since Joel Grey starred on Broadway as the complex, brilliant composer in ''George M!'' -- more than enough time for another look at the author of ''Yankee Doodle Dandy.'' In this version, which includes the songs of Mr. Cohan, Jon Peterson stars (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. 'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Opens March 16. Alec Baldwin stars in Joe Orton's jet-black comedy about a handsome stranger who seduces everyone else onstage (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. 'HARD RIGHT' Previews start Tuesday. Opens March 12. In David Barth's dark comedy, a slacker college student takes his girlfriend home to meet his parents, and a family trauma interrupts everything (1:30). Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. 'JACQUES BRIEL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' Previews start Sunday. Opens March 27. Something of a phenomenon in the late 1960's, the French singer's romantic music returns to New York in this musical, which features tangos, ballads, boleros and rock 'n' roll (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'RING OF FIRE' Opens March 12. Johnny Cash hits form the backbone of this musical about three couples. So far, it's received surprisingly good buzz. Richard Maltby Jr. directs (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'SIDD' Opens March 15. Herman Hesse's novel ''Siddhartha,'' the musical version (2:15). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'ACTS OF MERCY: PASSION-PLAY' If there is a coherent story to Michael John Garcés' ''Acts of Mercy: passion-play,'' it is resolutely kept from the audience. As the efforts of two brothers to reconcile with a dying father progress, it seems possible that viewers are meant to discern the consequences of family trauma from punchy monosyllabic combat and repeated expletives, but their efforts to connect are continually frustrated (2:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, west of Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Honor Moore) * 'ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL' This Theater for a New Audience production inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production in which there is nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role. Darko Tresnjak and his cast find a way to make the play's troubled romance, between the adoring Helena and the disdaining Bertram, psychologically credible and even touching (2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'CHRISTINE JORGENSON REVEALS' Bradford Louryk meticulously lip-syncs a fascinating hourlong interview about gender and sexuality with Ms. Jorgenson, whose sex change operation in the 1950's was big news (1:00). The Studio Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CLEAN ALTERNATIVES' Brian Dykstra's improbable comedy details the good fight fought by a businesswoman turned environmental activist taking on a toxin-spreading megacorporation. The play also depicts the moral transformation of a rapacious lawyer into a love-smitten puppy dog. Call it a fairy tale for our time (2:00). 59E59 Theaters , 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Zinoman) 'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'FANNY HILL' It's a musical version of the scandalous John Cleland novel, but it's not scandalous, very. It is, however, sometimes pretty funny, thanks to the incongruous eye of Ed Dixon, who wrote the book, lyrics and music (2:10). York Theater, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger) 'INDOOR/OUTDOOR' A comedy by Kenny Finkle about a housecat torn between affection for her human companion and a sexy tomcat promising a tour of the great outdoors. Directed by Darren Goldstein and energetically performed by a cast of four, it's essentially just another dysfunctional relationship tale, with little kitty whiskers drawn on (1:50). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, the play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Moore) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) 'THE WOODEN BREEKS' The line dividing inspired whimsy from tedious nonsense can be a fine one, and much of this new play by Glen Berger falls on the wrong side of it. An elaborately conceived comedy seeking to celebrate the consolations of storytelling, it unfolds the tale of a Scottish tinker who dreams up imaginary worlds to keep despair at bay. The cast is colorful, but the play is pallid, despite an intricate -- make that convoluted -- narrative (2:00). MCC Theater, at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. o.e. (Rob Kendt) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, closing Wednesday. (Genzlinger) 'THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE' Satire sans teeth by Charles Grodin about internecine warfare within a Fifth Avenue co-op board. Directed by Chris Smith, the show has the embarrassed air of someone who has just been served a choice steak and misplaced his dentures (1:30). Primary Stages, at 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BATTLE IN HEAVEN' (No rating, 94 minutes, in Spanish) An alternatingly mesmerizing and off-putting story about sex, class, God, soccer, an ugly man, a beautiful woman, a dead baby, the dirt below them and the wide sky above. The talented Mexican director Carlos Reygadas (''Japón'') strives to say something about his country, to tap into the spiritual and material desperation of its people, but doesn't seem especially committed to his material. (Manohla Dargis) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens) 'DIRTY' (R, 97 minutes) Cuba Gooding Jr. steps over to the bad side in a nihilistic, profanity-packed melodrama of corrupt Los Angeles cops that wants to be ''Training Day'' with street cred. It misses by a mile. (Holden) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'FIREWALL' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A thrill-challenged thriller starring Harrison Ford and directed by Richard Loncraine that manages to entertain mildly only because it traffics in all the familiar action-movie clichés, giving filmgoers ample opportunity to test their action-movie I.Q.'s. (Dargis) 'FREEDOMLAND' (R, 113 minutes) This inept, lethally dull drama directed by Joe Roth and written by Richard Price, from his novel, involves a white child who may have gone missing in a New Jersey public housing complex, where the residents are all black. A loud Samuel L. Jackson and a miscast Julianne Moore star. (Dargis) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOME' (No rating, 91 minutes) In ''Home,'' the debut feature from the writer and director Matt Zoller Seitz, a party in a Brooklyn brownstone is peopled by familiar types: the sensitive music geek, the slutty ex-girlfriend, the pretentious European writer. As dreams are interpreted, hearts are bruised, and a loudmouth in a velour tracksuit gets undeservedly lucky, ''Home'' accumulates a blurry, on-the-fly atmosphere spiked with moments of unexpected sweetness. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'LITTLE FISH' (R, 114 minutes) In this tough, savvy Australian film, Cate Blanchett sinks deeply into the role of a 32-year-old recovering heroin addict trying to rebuild her life and fighting the temptation to relapse. (Holden) * 'LOVE' (No rating, 93 minutes) Cool, mysterious and defiantly foreign, ''Love'' plays out on the immigrant fringes of an indifferent New York City. A Yugoslavian hit man, his German ex-wife and her cop boyfriend form a love triangle that propels a cosmopolitan cast into a violent game of cat and mouse. In these bleak, isolated neighborhoods, exquisitely shot by the Serbian cinematographer Vladimir Subotic, love and politics are inseparable, and the gleam of Manhattan is a million miles away. (Catsoulis) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) 'PINK PANTHER' (PG, 92 minutes) Steve Martin steps into the shoes of Peter Sellers in this intermittently witty revival of a vintage comedy franchise. Though finely honed, Mr. Martin's portrayal of the idiotic French police inspector Jacques Clouseau can't match Sellers's viscerally funny one. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) 'RUNNING SCARED' (R, 122 minutes) The idea here is meta-movie to the max, a deconstructed modern action flick by way of the brothers Grimm, in which few live happily ever after, and most don't even make it to the next day. Too bad that the director Wayne Kramer proves blood simple. (Dargis) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) 'SORRY, HATERS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shamelessly drawing on post-Sept. 11 anxieties, ''Sorry, Haters'' follows the increasingly irrational involvement of a New York cab driver (Abdellatif Kechiche), who is also a Syrian Muslim, and a disturbed fare (Robin Wright Penn). Yet despite the impressive commitment of the two leads, the movie unfolds with such utter looniness that the final, horrible moments are more likely to inspire laughter than shock. Apparently, the worst threat facing America today is not Islamic extremists but lonely young women with low self-esteem. (Catsoulis) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the movie rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'TSOTSI' (R, 94 minutes) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis) 'UNKNOWN WHITE MALE' (PG-13, 88 minutes) The British filmmaker Rupert Murray tells the bizarre story of his old friend Doug Bruce, who in 2003 walked into a Coney Island hospital claiming not to know who he was, thereupon becoming either a heart-wrenching casualty of a medical anomaly or the prime suspect in a mystery yet to be solved. (Dargis) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work begins tomorrow with ''The Toll of the Sea'' (1922), a silent color feature based on ''Madama Butterfly''; and ''Piccadilly'' (1929), in which Wong plays a scullery maid who moves up to nightclub stages. Both films will be accompanied by live music. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year. It continues this weekend with ''The Other Side'''' (2005), Natalia Almada's portrait of a young Mexican man trying to sing his way out of poverty; and ''A Model for Matisse: The Story of the Vence Chapel'' (2005), about Henri Matisse's friendship and special project with a French Dominican nun. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) ISRAEL FILM FESTIVAL (Through Thursday) This 21st annual festival continues this weekend with films including Eyal Ilan's ''Comrade'' (2005), about an adolescent boy's relationship with his sister's Communist neighbor; and Thorold Dickinson's ''Hill 24 Doesn't Answer''(1955), the personal stories of four young Zionists guarding a strategic spot outside Jerusalem. Clearview Cinema, 62nd Street and Broadway, (877) 966-5566; $10. (Gates) MAN IN THE DUNES: DISCOVERING HIROSHI TESHIGAHARA (Through March 19) BAMcinématek's tribute to Teshigahara (1927-2001), the artist, filmmaker and flower arranger, continues this weekend with ''Pitfall'' (1962), his first feature, about a mysterious killer and a small mining town. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) PRIX JEAN VIGO (Through Dec. 30) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Jean Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with a series of 41 films from directors who have won the prize that bears his name. This weekend's films are ''Le Beau Serge'' (1958), Claude Chabrol's drama about a man who returns to his hometown to find a childhood friend in bad shape; and ''Le Bleu du Ciel'' (2000), Christian Dor's short about a teenage boy home from a psychiatric hospital. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) SOME KIND OF HORROR SHOW (Through March 30) BAMcinématek's annual festival of horror movies begins on Monday with Dario Argento's ''Four Flies on Grey Velvet'' (1971), about a rock musician with a stalker. Other films in the series will include John Landis's ''Innocent Blood'' (1992), the adventures of a modern-day vampire who bites only bad people; Nicholas Roeg's ''Witches'' (1990), about a coven's convention; and ''Twisted Nerve'' (1968), a splatter movie with a Bernard Hermann score. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. BELLE AND SEBASTIAN/NEW PORNOGRAPHERS (Tonight) The deceptively gentle rock of the Scottish group Belle and Sebastian continues to find the exquisite balance between loll and lash. The New Pornographers are a revved-up Vancouver outfit whose smart power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until Neko Case's voice cuts through like a skywriter. 8:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $30 (Sold out). (Laura Sinagra) BLEEDING THROUGH, EVERY TIME I DIE (Thursday) Sidestepping the cookie-cutter emo punk stereotype, Bleeding Through plays speedy thrash metal. The Buffalo rockers Every Time I Die inject their version of hard-charging punk-metal with country swagger and gutter sleaze. 7:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16.75 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sinagra) MICHAEL BUBLÉ (Tomorrow) The crooner Michael Bublé has Bobby Darin as a polestar and Frank Sinatra to crib from. He also has looks, and tips his hat to modern styles, even rap, in ways that assure 50-year-old fans that they're not 80-year-old fans. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $49.50 to $104.50. (Sinagra) CLOUD ROOM (Tomorrow) The new-wave-influenced naïf rockers the Cloud Room garnered wild, though deeply underground, buzz when their best song, ''Hey Hey Now,'' written in the throes of the frontman's grave illness, was given lots of wish-you-wells but never broke into larger indie-pop consciousness. The indie-rock band Film School also plays. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sinagra) COMMON, FLOETRY (Sunday) The Chicago rapper Common has at times deserved the stigma attached to the label ''conscious rap'' -- preachiness and lackluster execution. On his latest material, though, he meets the challenge by working with the ''it'' producer Kanye West. The two women of Floetry mix the tough and the gentle amid a spirit of jazzy uplift. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $38.50 to $40. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) EBONY ECUMENICAL ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) This community choral group celebrates its 27th year with a repertory spanning what it calls the African-American religious experience. 7:30 p.m., Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 870-6722; $15 to $35. (Sinagra) DONALD FAGEN (Tonight and Tuesday) Steely Dan's jaded jazz-rocker tours in support of his first solo album since 1993, ''Morph the Cat'' (Reprise), on which, among other things, he focuses his recognizable leer on a hot airport security babe. Tonight at 8, North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800; $60 to $85. Tuesday at 8 p.m.., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $53.50 to $92. (Sinagra) GOGOGO AIRHEART, JAI-ALAI SAVANT, SUBTITLE (Monday) The Mars Volta guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez put together this tour to showcase bands on his record label, GSL, including the punky Gogogo Airheart, the reggae-punk Jai-Alai Savant and the Los Angeles rapper Subtitle. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra) DARYL HALL AND JOHN OATES (Tomorrow) The Philadelphia pop duo has always relied on the blue-eyed-soul crooner Daryl Hall's ability to emote within tight rhythmic constraints while John Oates harmonizes urgently above. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $40 to $93.50. (Sinagra) HAMELL ON TRIAL (Tonight and tomorrow night) The songwriter Ed Hamell whips up intense ditties commenting on the hypocrisies of modern life. The cultural climate, rife with saccharine displays and religious and moral piety, leaves the composer of ''Songs for Parents Who Enjoy Drugs'' no shortage of inspiration. 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $12. (Sinagra) BILLY JOEL (Tomorrow) The iconic piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50. (Sinagra) THE KLEZMATICS: 20TH ANNIVERSARY (Sunday) The Klezmatics love the laughing, moaning melodies of traditional klezmer music. They also love jazz, rock and downtown improvisation, and they bring all those styles to bear on their music, which can be raucous, hypnotic, reverent and dizzying, sometimes all in one quick-changing piece. They carry klezmer's itinerant, idea-gathering spirit all the way into present-day New York City. 4 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $32.50 to $37.50. (Jon Pareles) SERENA MANEESH (Monday) This Norwegian band takes a lighthearted approach to distorted, textured rock blare. Its alternately screeching and orchestral atmospherics are mismatched with vocal purr and squawk. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, 15 at the door. (Sinagra) DAVE MASON (Monday) The singer-guitarist Dave Mason, maybe best known for his work with Traffic, is the distinctive voice behind songs like ''Feelin' Alright'' and ''We Just Disagree.'' 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door.

(Sinagra) MATISYAHU (Monday and Tuesday) Matisyahu's Hasidic dancehall blends the rabbinical and the Rastafarian, combining a kind of Deadhead playfulness with resolute moralism as he chants -- sometimes in English, sometimes in Yiddish, sometimes in Caribbean patois. He is promoting a new album, recorded with the producer Bill Laswell. 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-7740; $25.50 in advance, $27.50 at the door.

(Sinagra) LE MYSTÈRE DES VOIX BULGARES (Tonight) Started 50 years ago with the goal of expanding the scope of Bulgarian folk music, Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares explores the possibilities of close harmonies, dissonance, unexpected rhythms and vocal tones that move from haunting to jarringly pointed. This performance, falling on Bulgarian Independence Day, is the group's first in the city in more than a decade. 7:30 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $23 to $28. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) NADA SURF, ROGUE WAVE (Wednesday) The Brooklyn alt-rockers Nada Surf tumbled into obscurity after a mid-90's MTV hit, then re-emerged in 2002 with the lovingly fashioned ''Let Go'' (Barsuk), which squints nostalgically at imagined childhood bliss through a snowy pane. Subsequent albums have continued in this style. Rogue Wave is a meditative band that plays the kind of wishing-well rock that, when done right, adds gravitas to your flakiest concerns. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sinagra) OF MONTREAL (Tonight) Part of the tail end of the mid-90's heyday of the Athens, Ga., indie-rock collective Elephant 6, the band Of Montreal has outlived lots of its other acts and continues to make fanciful melodic pop. 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) AMY RIGBY (Tonight) This singer-songwriter ponders romance and decline with biting wit.

(Sinagra) THE ROGERS SISTERS, CELEBRATION (Thursday) The Brooklyn power trio the Rogers Sisters have plied their perky new-wave craft during the recent spate of 80's revivalism in Williamsburg, though they seem to take themselves less seriously than most. Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra) THE STROKES, EAGLES OF DEATH METAL (Tonight and tomorrow night) Six years ago, with its exaggerated Tom Petty-like jitters and rich hipster slumming, the Strokes convinced jaded late-1990's clubbers that rock was back. The Eagles of Death Metal is the side project of the Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme, who indulges some of his funkier impulses. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882; $35. (Sinagra) THE WEDDING PRESENT, SALLY CREWE AND THE SUDDEN MOVES (Monday and Wednesday) After spending the late 90's in relative domestic bliss and putting out records with the band Cinerama, David Gedge has returned to his previous band the Wedding Present, and to the dirty-strummed electric bitterness that made it so beloved. Sally Crewe, a spunky Briton, unpins her lyrical wit with elemental guitar rock punch. Monday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $tk. (Sold out.)

(Sinagra) THE WOOD BROTHERS (Tuesday) The Wood Brothers are Oliver and Chris Wood, musical siblings reared in the Northwest, whose divergent paths led Oliver to blues-rock bands in Atlanta and Chris to New York, where he ended up in Medeski, Martin and Wood. Together they make roots rock. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $15.

(Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Chinen) TAYLOR HO BYNUM SEXTET (Monday) Mr. Bynum is a strong cornetist and serious-minded composer with experimental tendencies; polyphony is the chief emphasis in his sextet, which includes Matt Bauder on tenor saxophone and clarinets, Mary Halvorson and Evan O'Reilly on guitars, Tomas Fujiwara on drums and Jessica Pavone on viola and bass. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $8. (Chinen) MUSIC OF DONALD BYRD AND PEPPER ADAMS (Tuesday through March 12) The trumpeter Donald Byrd and the baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams made a passel of good hard-bop albums together from the late 1950's to the early 60's.

(Chinen) 4 GENERATIONS OF MILES (Through Sunday) The rapid permutation of Miles Davis's working bands makes it theoretically possible for four former sidemen to claim connection to four separate phases of his career; the musicians in question are the drummer Jimmy Cobb, the tenor saxophonist George Coleman, the bassist Buster Williams and the guitarist Mike Stern. 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $32.50 and $35, with a $10 minimum.

(Laura Sinagra) * FRED HERSCH (Through Sunday) Mr. Hersch's solo piano recitals are transcendent affairs, as evidenced most recently by an excellent album called ''Fred Hersch in Amsterdam: Live at the Bimhuis'' (Palmetto). He is the first solo pianist ever to headline a weeklong Village Vanguard engagement. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) AHMAD JAMAL TRIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) A touchstone of jazz piano since the 50's, Mr. Jamal still has his broad dynamic range and signature touch; his highly sympathetic rhythm section consists of the bassist James Cammack and the drummer Idris Muhammad. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables and a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) JOE LOVANO QUARTET (Wednesday through March 11) Mr. Lovano has become one of the stalwart saxophonists in modern jazz, equally inspired by John Coltrane's harmonic inquiry, Ornette Coleman's off-kilter lyricism and Ben Webster's heart-rending croon. This band, his newest, includes James Weidman on piano, Esperanza Spalding on bass and Francisco Mela on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) EIVIND OPSVIK'S OVERSEAS (Monday) Mr. Opsvik is a Norwegian bassist and composer who balances avant-gardism against poplike lyricism, as he demonstrates here in a band with Tony Malaby on tenor saxophone, Jacob Sacks on piano and Kenny Wollesen on drums. 9:30 p.m., Mundial, 505 East 12th Street, East Village, (212) 982-1282, mundialnyc.com; no cover. (Chinen) CHRIS POTTER'S UNDERGROUND (Tuesday through March 12) The saxophonist Chris Potter has an improvisational approach that's intellectual and athletic in equal measure; his band Underground dives headlong into edgy fusion, with Adam Rogers on guitar, Craig Taborn on Fender Rhodes piano and Nate Smith on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20 and $25.(Chinen) WALLACE RONEY SEXTET (Tuesday through March 12) On his recent album ''Mystikal'' (High Note), Mr. Roney advanced a variety of Afrocentric futurism inherited and adapted from his trumpet mentor, Miles Davis. He explores similar territory in an ensemble with his wife, Geri Allen, on piano; his brother, Antoine Roney, on tenor and soprano saxophones; and the unrelated rhythm section of Val Jeanty on turntables, Clarence Seay on bass and Eric Allen on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) PONCHO SANCHEZ (Through Sunday) Mr. Sanchez, a high-spirited conga player, has been one of the leading figures in Latin jazz for more than 20 years, in large part because of this effervescent working band. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Amato Opera's reputation is that it conveys the spirit and love of Italian opera, though the full impact is impossible to achieve in a 102-seat theater with a cast that changes at every performance. And against the odds, all the principals at a recent performance of ''Aida'' managed to make it through to the end, demonstrating a true love of the piece if not always of the pitch. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) 'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' (Wednesday) Alfano's amiable, ambling version of ''Cyrano'' continues its Met run, and Plácido Domingo is expected to return, after vocal problems, to the title role. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6200; $26 to $175. (Bernard Holland) 'DARKLING' (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) In an adventurous move, American Opera Projects is presenting a brave and sensitive, if at times frustrating, multimedia work. With a score by Stefan Weisman, ''Darkling'' is an ''operatic fantasia on themes of emotional fragmentation,'' in the words of the director Michael Comlish, who conceived the idea of adapting for the stage Anna Rabinowitz's book-length poem about a restless Polish couple who marry hastily before the invasion of the Nazis. 8 p.m., East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $45. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) It's tempting to say that ''Forza'' has the most numbingly ludicrous libretto of any Verdi opera, but with such stiff competition, who can say? Giancarlo del Monaco's drab staging, first seen in 1996 and hidden away in storage since then, offers little help, but the Met does have a solid cast, with Deborah Voigt, Salvatore Licitra and Mark Delavan. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 to $220 remaining tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Tuesday. (Allan Kozinn) * 'MAZEPPA' (Monday) The Metropolitan Opera has never before staged Tchaikovsky's ''Mazeppa,'' although the Kirov Opera brought it to the stage here in 1998. The Kirov has a strong role in this brand-new staging: it's a co-production with the Met, conducted by the Met's principal guest conductor and Kirov head, Valery Gergiev, with Olga Guryakova, Larissa Diadkova, Nikolai Putilin and Paata Burchuladze in leading roles. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $35 to $250. (Midgette) 'THE MOST HAPPY FELLA' (Tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) For the 50th anniversary of Frank Loesser's wonderful musical, the New York City Opera opens its spring season with its production, by Philip Wm. McKinley. Though the company has had mixed success with presenting musicals, this production looks intriguing. The compelling actor Paul Sorvino takes the title role of Tony, an aging immigrant vineyard owner who courts a struggling young waitress through the mail. Loesser's rich and tuneful score is more sophisticated than many an opera. George Manahan conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 and 8:30 p.m., and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. (previews); Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 to $120. (Tommasini) 'ROMÉO ET JULIETTE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The big news from the Met's new production of this Gounod opera is the French coloratura soprano Natalie Dessay. Singing with uncanny agility and lyrical elegance, she touchingly embodies the tragically impulsive young Juliette. The tenor Ramón Vargas, though a stiff actor, delivers a vocally impassioned Roméo. Bertrand de Billy conducts a refined account of Gounod's most sophisticated score. (For the final performance on Thursday, Maureen O'Flynn replaces Ms. Dessay.) Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Thursday. (Tommasini) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tonight) José Luis Duval as Alfredo joins Angela Gheorghiu in this successful revival at the Met. 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out. (Holland) 'TREEMONISHA' (Thursday) The enterprising and top-rate Collegiate Chorale, with Robert Bass conducting, presents a semistaged performance of Scott Joplin's 1911 opera, ''Treemonisha,'' conceived by Roger Rees. To appreciate this humane and musically beguiling work, you have to look past what contemporary audiences might see as stereotyped depictions of former slaves during Reconstruction. Still, the story is told from the perspectives of the newly freed slaves, who turn to a modest and educated young girl, Treemonisha, as their leader. And Joplin's wistful music is subtle and affecting. Anita Johnson sings the title role. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500: $25 to $60. (Tommasini) Classical Music ANNE AZÉMA, JOEL COHEN and SHIRA KAMMEN (Sunday) The lutenist Joel Cohen has assembled many an inventive program for his Boston Camerata, and he brings his latest -- ''Chanson du Désert: The Heroic Deeds of Guillaume d'Orange'' -- to the Cloisters for two performances. The performance, to be sung by Anne Azéma and Shira Kemmen, centers on works about the eighth- and ninth-century warrior who fought for Charlemagne and is the subject of four medieval epic poems. 1 and 3 p.m., Fort Tryon Park, (212) 650-2290; $35. (Kozinn) * MAYA BEISER (Thursday) Formerly the cellist of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, Ms. Beiser has spread her wings into an even more eclectic and distinctive solo career. Her recital at Zankel Hall presents four world premieres, including a new work by Eve Beglarian, with accompanying video by the acclaimed artist Shirin Neshat. The other new works are by Michael Gordon, Joby Talbot and Brett Dean. 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 and $35. (Midgette) BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) It's no doubt just a coincidence, but on Monday, when the Metropolitan Opera presents its premiere production of Tchaikovsky's ''Mazeppa'' with Valery Gergiev, James Levine, the Met's music director, will be at Carnegie Hall conducting this orchestra in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. If you choose to go with Beethoven and Mr. Levine, you will also hear Schoenberg's breakthrough work, the Chamber Symphony No. 1. And the roster of vocal soloists for the Beethoven, topped by the soprano Christine Brewer, looks enticing. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $52 to $175. (Tommasini) IAN BOSTRIDGE (Wednesday) This elegant, brainy British tenor is joined by a handful of colleagues -- including the countertenor Bejun Mehta and the tenor Nathan Gunn -- for an installment in his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall. His subject this time is Britten, who will be explored by way of his ''Winter Words,'' as well as all five Canticles. 7:30. Zankel Hall, at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $40 to $48. (Kozinn) PAUL GALBRAITH (Tomorrow) By using an eight-string guitar, played as if it were a cello -- held vertically, and resting on a peg connected to a resonating box -- Mr. Galbraith has been able expand the volume, range and harmonic possibilities available to him. He is also a thoughtful player, and his program includes his own arrangements of Bach's Cello Suite No. 4, Ravel's ''Mother Goose'' Suite -- a stretch for the guitar, but his solutions should be fascinating -- and works by Rameau, Martin and Mozart. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $40. (Kozinn) * HESPÈRION XXI AND LA CAPELLA REIAL DE CATALUNYA (Tomorrow) As part of an extended visit with his various ensembles that includes performances all over Manhattan, Jordi Savall leads his remarkable Hespèrion XXI ensemble and his vocal group in works by Spanish composers, among them, Gaspar Sanz, Luis Milán, Santiago de Murcia and Matheo Flecha. 8 p.m., Church of St. Paul the Apostle, Columbus Avenue at 60th Street, (212) 854-7799; $40. (Kozinn) JERUSALEM SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Leon Botstein has carved out a career as a conductor on a combination of erudition and crack fund-raising skills. This weekend he comes to the New York area on tour with one of his orchestras in an uncharacteristically mainstream program that includes Copland's ''Appalachian Spring'' and Prokofiev's Fifth. (The orchestra comes to Carnegie Hall on March 12.) Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tilles Center at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100; $48 to $88.

(Midgette) 'LA LÉGENDE D'EER' (Tonight) For the 1978 opening of the Pompidou Center in Paris, the composer Iannis Xenakis created this multimedia piece, which combined music, architecture, light imagery and texts and played for three months. Last year Mode Records released a DVD and CD of the work, and tonight, in the second of two performances, it will be recreated live. 8, Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 979-1027; $12. (Tommasini) MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight and tomorrow) Every season this renowned festival in Vermont sends rosters of performers, both veteran artists and young talents, on tour across the country. Two different groups are performing in New York this weekend. Tonight the pianist Gilbert Kalish is joined by several impressive wind players in works by Nielsen, Schubert, Carter and Beethoven. Tomorrow the Peoples' Symphony Concerts series presents a roster of string players and the pianist Jeremy Denk in works by John Harbison, Ravel and Schubert. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $40. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9.

(Holland) RUSSIAN NATIONAL ORCHESTRA (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday) Three concerts of Russian music played by Russians. The conductor Vladimir Jurowski brings Yefim Bronfman to play Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto on Sunday, and continues with some Stravinsky and much more Tchaikovsky. Sunday at 3 p.m., Monday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69. (Holland) DORA SERES (Tuesday) The organization Young Concert Artists often presents New York recital debuts by its latest audition winners, but this week's recital by Dora Seres, a young Hungarian flutist, definitely does not appear to be more of the same -- at least on paper -- because of striking programming that includes works by Toru Takemitsu and Lowell Liebermann, Carl Reinecke and Paul Taffanel, Sigfrid Karg-Elert and Carl Maria von Weber. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 and $35. (Midgette) MIHAELA URSULEASA (Sunday) This young Romanian-born, Vienna-trained pianist performs a recital of Shostakovich, Scriabin, Beethoven and Brahms. 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700; $20.(Jeremy Eichler) * VIENNA PHILHARMONIC (Tonight through Sunday) Riccardo Muti leads one of the world's premium orchestras in three programs that, conservative as they are, at least put a toe into the last century. Tonight, Hindemith's ''Nobilissima Visione'' Suite and the Schubert Ninth. Tomorrow, Schubert's Fourth and ''Rosamunde'' Overture, Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante and Strauss's ''Death in Transfiguration'' should let listeners revel in the orchestra's uncommonly rich string sound. And on Sunday, Mr. Muti draws on what must seem like spicy exoticism to the Viennese, with Bartok's ''Two Pictures,'' Ravel's ''Rapsodie Espagnole'' and Falla's ''Three-Cornered Hat,'' all preceded by music from the orchestra's home turf, Mozart's ''Haffner'' Symphony. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $58 to $195.

(Kinetz) * LAURA PAWEL DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Pawel and her dancers and musicians, some of them grizzled, longtime presences on the city's modern-dance scene, are content to make and perform small, plain dances about the everyday, often seasoned with wry reminiscences that reveal the everyday as not so ordinary. And their contentment is infectious. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 5 p.m. Dance Forum, 20 East 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 212-633-7202; $15.. (Dunning) CIE. MARTINE PISANI (Tonight through Sunday) From Paris, this modern-dance company will present ''sans,'' which merges comedy and minimalism in the presences and movement styles of three company members.

In this New York debut, she will present pieces set to music by John Harbison and Elena Ruehr, as well as Bach played live by the cellist Emmanuel Feldman. The Boston reviewer Marcia B. Siegel described her work as drawing from ''the theatricality of Denishawn dance, the extroverted skills of ballet and the physical investment of modern dance.'' Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (978) 852-3863; $20 and $35; $15 for students.

(John Rockwell) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. One particularly intense work, based on the belief that Abubakari II, ruler of Mali, crossed the Atlantic nearly 200 years before Columbus to discover the Americas, links the past with the present and Africa with the beloved Columbus of Ms. Robinson's childhood. Her works do not lend themselves to easy deciphering, but her magic with materials and her daring compositional imagination draw you in. Her art rings true. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) * COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DAVID SMITH: A CENTENNIAL,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF MEDICINE IN ANCIENT EGYPT,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: 'COMBINES,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.)(Nicolai Ouroussoff) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith) P.S. 1: JESSICA STOCKHOLDER: 'OF STANDING FLOAT ROOTS IN THIN AIR,' through May 1. A soaring, cannily designed installation -- made of airborne plastic bins, electric lights, orange extension cords and an old armchair topping a wooden tower -- by a sculptor known for orchestrating productive collisions of formalism and consumerism. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Ken Johnson) P.S. 1: RICKY SWALLOW: 'METICULOUS,' through March 20. Extraordinarily realistic and symbolically portentous sculptures carved from wood by Australia's representative to last summer's Venice Biennale, in which three of the five works on view here were included. (See above.) (Johnson) * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Galleries: 57th Street STEPHEN GREENE: 'PLEASURE DOME' In abstract paintings from late in his career, Greene (1917-1999) created shimmering mindscapes in which fiery reds and oranges and electric blues and greens glow through areas of muddy browns and grays. Made with a touch that is sometimes brusque and sometimes exquisitely sensitive, the paintings combine sensuous immediacy and visionary romanticism. Jason McCoy, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 319-1996, through March 11. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea NATALIE FRANK: 'UNVEILING' Still in graduate school (at Columbia) but already the subject of considerable media attention, Ms. Frank paints expansive, Eric Fischl-like pictures in which nude bodies and lavish floral arrangements combine to create anxiously erotic daydreams. Briggs Robinson, 527 West 29th Street, (212) 560-9075, through March 11. (Johnson) AMY GRANAT: SCRATCH FILMS/STARS WAY OUT (FOR O.K.) A beautiful installation using three looped projections of manipulated black-and-white film that create an animated but slightly sinister environment of shifting geometric motifs: parallel lines, blocks and spots. It might have been made at almost any time during the last 40 years, but the percussive soundtrack provides a modicum of newness. More is needed. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, through March 11. (Smith) JERRY KEARNS: 'FOREVER MORE' For many years Mr. Kearns has been making illustrative paintings combining Pop-Surrealist style, leftist politics and anti-consumerist social commentary, with humor and obviousness often battling to a draw. His new paintings feature muscle-bound Jesus figures, hysterical hermaphrodites, creepy children, magical birds, fast-food products and heavenly blue skies. Michael Steinberg, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 924-5770, through March 11. (Johnson) JAMES RIECK: 'FLOWER GIRLS' Working from old bridal catalogues, Mr. Rieck paints silvery cropped images of angelic girls wearing white dresses, shoes and gloves. Lyons Wier, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6220, through March 11. (Johnson) MIMI SMITH: 'DRAWINGS FROM THE 60'S TO THE PRESENT' Known for witty feminist sculptures based on women's clothing, Ms. Smith here presents drawings sampling her five-decade career, including a large, three-dimensional paper house covered with fine writing protesting environmental pollution and recent sets of finely made images of shoes and underwear representing stages in a woman's life from infancy to old age. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, through March 4. (Johnson) Other Galleries * 'DO YOU THINK I'M DISCO' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * ANYA GALLACCIO: 'ONE ART' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) THE STUDIO VISIT The studio visit, a time-honored ritual that everyone in the art world has both endured and learned from, is taken to its limit in Exit Art's latest exhibition marathon. Each of the 160 mostly short videos represents one artist's idea of, play on, or substitute for, a studio visit. It is a show that often cries out for a fast-forward button, but there are some notable gems -- for example, by Joyce Pensato, Cynthia von Buhler, Ida Applebroog, Bruce Pearson, Lance Wakeling, Taylor McKimens, Paul Wirhun, Elisabeth Kley, Christy Gast and Kim Jones. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 966-7745, through March 25. (Smith) 'ZOO STORY' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson) Last Chance CAITLIN ATKINSON: 'CHAPTERS' Comical and touching staged photographs portray the artist herself in moments of anxiety and disappointment: contemplating a dish of lasagna she burned; apparently abandoned in an empty grocery store parking lot; and starting to disrobe at a nude beach. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) JOE BRADLEY: 'KURGAN WAVES' Large, blocky men assembled from flimsy, brusquely painted canvases seem to have convened for a mysterious tribal ritual in Mr. Bradley's sharp sendup of Minimalist orthodoxy. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, between Hester and Canal Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) CHUCK CLOSE, ANNIE LEIBOVITZ, VIK MUNIZ: 'INVENTIVE FASHION PHOTOGRAPHS' Photographs of the silhouettes of fashion models, shaped in bent wire and based on fashion photographs by Vik Muniz; daguerreotype pictures of a naked Kate Moss; and fashion spreads by Annie Leibovitz based on ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Danziger, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 629-6778, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, closes Sunday. (Glueck) ROBERT S. NEUMAN: 'FIFTY YEARS' With good-humored generosity and a skillful, sensuous touch, Mr. Neuman has painted his way through several different genres over the course of his five-decade career, including Abstract Expressionism, geometric formalism, funky allegorical narrative and painterly landscapes that mourn the losses of the American Indians. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, closes Monday.. (Johnson) * P.S. 1: 'PETER HUJAR,' When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, closes Monday. (Cotter) * MATT SAUNDERS The work of this young Berlin-based American artist falls midway between Robert Ryman and Andy Warhol in its acute awareness of painting's physical constitution and its love of movie stars and glamour. The slick, illustrational painting style is a big problem, but the use of light, space, film projectors and the moving image (in a hand-drawn animation) has considerable potential. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290, closes tomorrow. (Smith) MACRAE SEMANS This New York debut introduces a promising bricoleur whose sculptures are carefully worked-out vortexes of abject and elegant and found and made that make rich asides to the histories of art and design but need to distinguish themselves from the work of several other artists mining the same vein. Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 924-0212, closes tomorrow. (Smith) 'SITE 92' The second exhibition in this nonprofit gallery's impressive big, new space presents site-specific works by more than 25 artists. Highlights include a colorful column of hovering butterflies made of candy wrappers by Luisa Caldwell; fanciful architectural elements painted on the wall by Amy Yoes; people imitating the sounds of pigeons in an audio-video work by Beth Krebs; and, by Virginia Poundstone, a tableau representing a satellite that has crashed in the jungle. Smack Mellon, 92 Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 834-8761, closes Sunday. (Johnson) 'SPACE BOOMERANG' This darkly theatrical show includes sculptures like Cubist bathtubs by Mike Bouchet; a bicycle with endlessly spinning wheels by Jonathan Monk; a Minimalist wall sculpture dented on purpose by Bruno Peinado; a wall that intermittently vibrates violently by Loris Gréaud; a magical light and smoke sculpture by Ann Veronica Janssens; a video documenting Gianni Motti's walk through a particle accelerator; a motorcycle immersed in the wax of burning candles by Mark Handforth; and a long, sleek wall of black plastic-shaded lights by Lang/Baumann. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, closes Thursday. (Johnson)"

Steven Fales tells his unusual life story (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street; (212) 691-1555. 'FANNY HILL' Previews start Wednesday. Opens Feb. 14. A musical based on the 18th-century novel about a country girl who moves to London to become a prostitute (2:00). York Theater, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, 619 Lexington Avenue, at East 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' Opens Feb. 14. Mr. Darcy becomes Marcy in this gender-switching musical retelling of ''Pride and Prejudice,'' which stars Stephane D'Abruzzo from ''Avenue Q'' (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village; (212) 307-4100. 'INDOOR/OUTDOOR' Previews start Thursday. Opens Feb. 22. The playwright Kenny Finkle aims for the cat lover demographic in this relationship comedy about a computer programmer and his chatty feline (1:50). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. 'JUMP/CUT' Previews start Wednesday. Opens Feb. 12. Neena Beber's cinematic, dry play about the love triangle of two aspiring filmmakers and a manic-depressive was a hit in Washington. Leigh Silverman directs (2:10). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Opens Feb. 23. Labor unrest leads to romance in this classic musical about a manager and a union representative at a pajama factory. Harry Connick Jr. stars, and Kathleen Marshall directs (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street; (212) 719-1300. 'RED LIGHT WINTER' Opens Feb. 9. Throw two men, a prostitute and one Amsterdam evening into an Adam Rapp drama, and you may well have some trouble. Variety calls it Mr. Rapp's ''most commercial outing'' (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village; (212) 239-6200. 'THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE' Opens Feb. 9. A grumpy Charles Grodin delves into the dark, mysterious world of Manhattan co-op boards in this Primary Stages comedy (1:30). 59E59, 59 East 59th Street; (212) 279-4200. 'THE SEVEN' Opens Feb. 12. The hip-hop theater pioneer Will Power's large-cast adaptation of Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes.'' Jo Bonney directs (2:00).

MCC Theater presents Glen Berger's gothic fairy tale set in the fictitious Scottish town of Brood (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 279-4200. Broadway 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman from Feb. 14 through March 26. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger) * '(I AM) NOBODY'S LUNCH' The elusive nature of truth in a culture swamped with stuff that looks, sounds and smells like information -- but may be something a little more suspicious -- is the serious subject of this merrily unserious, vaudevillian romp through the anxious chatter of contemporary America. Snappy, scrappy and performed with a youthful blend of earnestness and deadpan razzmatazz by the buzzed-about downtown troupe the Civilians (1:30). 59E59, 59 East 59th Street; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'LOVELY DAY' Tiresome evening (1:15). Beckett Theater, Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt) 'HARVEST' Manjula Padmanabhan's sci-fi parable is a dark fantasy about a high-tech racket in body organs -- a cross between the 2002 thriller ''Dirty Pretty Things'' and an episode of ''The Twilight Zone.'' Based in Delhi, India, Ms. Padmanabhan wrote the play in 1996; this is its New York premiere (1:25). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ANTON' It is one thing to write a play about Anton Chekhov's last four years, quite another to attempt the master's style, then produce and direct it and portray the title character. Though Pierre van der Spuy's reach far exceeds his grasp, he deserves some credit for trying (2:15). Greenwich Street Theater, 547 Greenwich Street, between Charlton and Vandam Streets, South Village; (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. (Andrea Stevens) *'THE END OF REALITY' Violence isn't pretty in the listless but eventful world of Richard Maxwell's hypnotic new play. It's not ugly, either. In this latest work from the king of affecting disaffection, violence doesn't so much explode as drip, like water from a leaky faucet, into the lives of lonely, hapless security guards. Mr. Maxwell's most eloquent statement to date about the blurring of despair and apathy in American lives (1:40). The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793; closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'GONER' The president is shot, and the world's worst doctors get the job of trying to save him in this very funny bit of sketch comedy disguised as a play. Bad taste seems not to be an issue for the author, Brian Parks, but most of the lunacy is inspired enough that you can forgive the insensitivity (1:15). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 'HOUSE OF DESIRE' This 300-year-old farce, written by a nun, mostly proves that Baroque women were just as capable as Baroque men of producing forgettable plays. It's sometimes fun watching the energetic young actors trying to breathe life into it, though, especially during a smashing sword fight conducted in semi-darkness (2:10). Storm Theater, 145 West 46th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 'MAJOR BARBARA' George Bernard Shaw's polemic against the military-industrial complex and organized religion is still timely 100 years later, and though the director Brooke O'Harra's Kabuki-tinged version lands on the mark and misses it about equally, there is something true and real about the production that is worth seeing (2:35). La MaMa Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710; closing Sunday. (Stevens) 'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4-year-old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300; closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'WHAT THEN' Even if Rinne Groff's playful play about environmental disaster is occasionally labored, there's never any doubt that there's an active, lively intelligence at work (1:30). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden) * 'THE FALL OF FUJIMORI' (No rating, 83 minutes, in English and Spanish) Ellen Perry's examination of Alberto Fujimori, who ruled Peru from 1990 to 2000, is a complex study in the psychology of power and also an unsettling examination of the risks that fighting terrorism can pose to democratic institutions and values. (Scott) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) 'GO FOR ZUCKER' (No rating, 95 minutes, in German) In this German-Jewish comedy, factions of a divided family, half Orthodox Jewish and half secular, join forces to collect an inheritance. It might be described as a hybrid of the much funnier French farce ''La Cage aux Folles'' and the recent Israeli film ''Ushpizin.'' (Holden) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Manohla Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Nathan Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) 'LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE MUSLIM WORLD' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Albert Brooks takes his anxious, cerebral act on the road, to India and Pakistan. Great satiric potential, most of it squandered after a hilarious opening. (Scott) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) 'TRISTAN & ISOLDE' (PG-13, 125 minutes) The lovers of Celtic mythology, Arthurian legend and Wagnerian libretto fall for each other far from the violent, Dark Ages machinations plaguing their two warring peoples. A pleasant entertainment from the director Kevin Reynolds that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more. (Dargis) '24 HOURS ON CRAIGSLIST' (No rating, 82 minutes) Directed (kind of) and produced by Michael Ferris Gibson, a disorganized if watchable stroll through human desire as manifested on the popular Web site (three billion page views each month). (Dargis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series ANOTHER SPANISH CINEMA: FILMS IN CATALUNYA 1906-2006 (Through Feb. 14) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Catalan film begins tonight with Isabel Coixet's ''Secret Life of Words'' (2005), starring Sarah Polley, Julie Christie and Javier Cámara.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, M1 (Tonight) The Atlanta hip-hop group Arrested Development's decidedly preachy new-soul peaked too early to make it part of the rise of the ''Dirty South'' style, but it carried the kind of positive messages that characterized lots of early 1990's bohemian rap. M1 is half of the political rap group Dead Prez. 7:30, Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $25. (Laura Sinagra) BABY DAYLINER (Tonight) Baby Dayliner is the stage name of Ethan Marunas, a keyboard-driven one-man band.

King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Pareles) BLUE OYSTER CULT (Tonight) When science fiction met heavy metal and lighthearted fetishism in Blue Oyster Cult songs of the 70's like ''Cities on Flame With Rock 'n' Roll,'' ''(Don't Fear) the Reaper,'' ''Godzilla'' and ''Dominance and Submission,'' it hardly mattered whether the band's original intentions were tongue-in-cheek. Its post-Zeppelin, pre-punk riffs and its wild-eyed lyrics still sound good. 6 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $27.50 and $32.

(Sinagra) BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE (Tonight and tomorrow night) This Canadian collective makes heartbreak music that sounds like a fuzzy, drunken party.

(Sinagra) EVAN DANDO (Tomorrow) After spending the late 1990's in exile, this alt-pop heartthrob has cleaned up his act and taken tentative steps back into the limelight with solo projects and some revisiting of old hits and matter-of-fact melodicism. 10 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; $15. (Sinagra) DEERHOOF (Monday) This excitingly whimsical band harbors affection in equal parts for No Wave angularity, exuberant noise-pop and outsider naïf art like that of the Shaggs. Its latest material is more pacific than earlier work, which included an electronically augmented fractured fairy tale about a kidnapping milkman. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 (sold out). (Sinagra) BO DIDDLEY (Thursday) When Bo Diddley plays his namesake beat and growls the metaphysical boasts of ''Who Do You Love?,'' it's easy to hear the fire and syncopation that made him a rock pioneer.

(Sinagra) BILLY JOEL (Thursday) The iconic piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music.

(Sinagra) LEZ ZEPPELIN (Tonight) Strapping on the double-necked Gibson with attitude to burn, this all-girl quartet pays tribute to its swaggering namesake Led Zeppelin, ripping through the catalog with blazing accuracy.

(Sinagra) THE NATIONAL, CAGE, CELEBRATION, BEANS (Thursday) The National is a group of New York-based Ohio natives who turn out a kind of pent-up, countrified indie rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. A longtime fixture on the indie rap scene, Cage often recalls his fractured childhood and rough upbringing. Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. The rapid-fire rapper Beans is also on the bill. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20.

(Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Stephen Holden) Andrea Marcovicci (Tonight and tomorrow night) In her spellbinding retrospective ''I'll Be Seeing You Love Songs of World War II,'' Ms. Marcovicci balances nostalgia for songs associated with ''the good war'' with acknowledgment of the real pain and sacrifice that inspired so many of them, providing a dusting of reality. 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $65 cover, with a required $60 prix-fixe dinner at the early shows; $20 minimum required for the late shows.

(Chinen) KENNY WERNER'S COSMOCENTRIC (Tuesday through Feb. 5) Mr. Werner is a well-seasoned pianist who tempers fearsome technique with a kind of questing spiritualism; this aptly named ensemble consists of musicians with similar temperaments, like the trumpeter Kenny Wheeler, the saxophonist David Sanchez and the drummer Brian Blade. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables and a $5 minimum, or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) * JOE WILDER QUARTET (Tuesday through Feb. 5) The trumpeter Joe Wilder, still playing well in his mid-80's, has had a wealth of professional experience both in and out of jazz. But he has only rarely led his own group in a New York club residency, which makes this quartet engagement -- with the pianist Michael Weiss, the bassist John Webber and the drummer Lewis Nash -- a sort of landmark event. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Thursday) The Metropolitan Opera's exuberant production keeps blasting away, here with Andrea Gruber, Olga Borodina and Johan Botha. James Conlon conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Bernard Holland) COLLEGIATE CHORALE (Monday) This company is eager to put itself on the map and keeps coming up with new ways to do it. Here's one: offer a couple of fine sopranos who seem underappreciated at the Met these days, Hei-Kyung Hong and Aprile Millo, in a Puccini one-acter (''Le Villi'') and the last act of that composer's final masterpiece (''Turandot'') with a new ending by Luciano Berio. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $155. (Anne Midgette) 'COSÌ FAN TUTTE' (Tomorrow) This is the ultimate ensemble opera and the Met's revival of its sunny and simple 1996 production this fall was an impressive effort from a young, attractive and gifted cast. ''Così'' has returned this month, with all but two members of that cast. The bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties takes the place of Barbara Frittoli as Fiordiligi. The engaging mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena again sings her sister, Dorabella. The lyric tenor Paul Groves, taking the place of Matthew Polenzani, and the robust baritone Mariusz Kwiecien (a star in the making) portray the young men who cruelly test the fidelity of the two sisters. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 tickets remaining. (Anthony Tommasini) 'DEAD MAN WALKING' (Tuesday) Jake Heggie's opera is based on a true story by Sister Helen Prejean. She is a featured guest at the Trinity Institute's National Theological Conference this year, and Trinity Church is taking the opportunity to present scenes from the opera with the renowned mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade, along with discussions with Sister Helen, Ms. von Stade and the composer. Owen Burdick leads the Trinity Church Choir. 8 p.m., Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $100. (Midgette) 'THE MERRY NIBELUNGS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) This Oscar Straus operetta spoofing Wagner's ''Ring'' is a famous sendup. More power to the Dicapo Opera for giving people a rare chance to hear it, albeit in concert performances by members of its young artist program. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 4, Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438; $20; $10 for children. (Midgette) 'RIGOLETTO' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The soprano Anna Netrebko and the tenor Rolando Villazón, opera's hottest vocal couple of late, bring star appeal and impressive artistry to the Met's 1989 Otto Schenk production. With her dusky-toned and exciting voice, Ms. Netrebko gives an unusually emotional portrayal of Gilda. Mr. Villazón brings an ardent voice, Verdian style and virile energy to the Duke of Mantua. Plácido Domingo, who knows a thing or two about the lead tenor role, conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tonight and Monday) Back after its winter break, the Metropolitan Opera was still working out the vacation kinks at its first production of Julie Taymor's pageant of a ''Die Zauberflöte,'' and its cast of young Americans was not uniformly up to speed. No matter, evidently: the spectacle is undeniable, the performances will only get smoother as the run continues, and the production is popular enough to sell the house out. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out, though returns may be available at the box office. (Midgette) Classical Music AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Leon Botstein and his orchestra do another of their historical excavations, this time Schumann's oratorio ''Das Paradies und die Peri.'' 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $53. (Holland) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) This floating concert hall on the Brooklyn side of the East River offers the intimacy that chamber music needs, as well as a wonderful view of Lower Manhattan through the bay windows behind stage. Tonight Patrycja Piekutowska, a violinist, and Jonathan Yates, a pianist, offer a program of contemporary Polish music, including works by Krzysztof Penderecki, Grazyna Bacewicz, Szymanowski and Lutoslawski. Tomorrow and Sunday, an expanded ensemble plays chamber works by Mozart, Françaix and Poulenc, and an arrangement of Strauss's ''Till Eulenspiegel.'' And on Thursday, Olga Vinokur, a pianist, plays a hefty program of Schumann, Liszt, Brahms and Chopin. Tonight and tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35; $40 tomorrow and Sunday.

(Holland) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight, Sunday and Tuesday) Having just taken the bold step of presenting a Ligeti mini-festival, the Chamber Music Society is backtracking quickly, offering three concerts of music we hear almost constantly, but dressing them up as a contribution to the global Mozart celebration. Tonight is piano music, with the Concerto No. 14, the Sonata in D for Two Pianos and the G-minor Piano Quartet. Tomorrow's program -- the most appealing of the three -- includes the extraordinary Divertimento in E flat for string trio, as well as the ''Kegelstatt'' Clarinet Trio and the Violin Sonata in D. On Tuesday, the Orion String Quartet, with Michael Tree, the violist of the Guarneri Quartet, perform the Viola Quintets (K. 515 and 516) and the String Quartet in E flat. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49.

Formed at Juilliard, the Claremont offers a program that includes Beethoven's ''Ghost'' Trio and works by Mendelssohn and Paul Schoenfield. 7:30, Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42. (Midgette) CUARTETO CASALS (Tomorrow and Sunday) In a stunning performance at the Frick Collection last February, this Spanish string quartet produced an appealingly tactile, tangy and remarkably precise sound. It is back for two concerts this weekend. Tomorrow, as part of the Peoples' Symphony series, the group will perform Mozart's Quartets in B flat (K. 159) and F (K. 168), Webern's Five Movements for String Quartet and the Debussy Quartet.

This year's festival, ''New and Now,'' features many pieces commissioned for the school's big birthday from composers around the world.

The festival continues next week with additional programs every night, starting on Monday. 8, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, though tickets are required. (Tommasini) NATALIA GUTMAN (Tomorrow) This great Russian cellist won several important competitions in the late 1960's and became known to American audiences mainly through recordings. Her appearance, a hybrid recital and chamber program, begins with Bach's Suite No. 3 for unaccompanied cello and also includes the Schubert ''Arpeggione'' Sonata, Brahms's Piano Trio No. 3 and Shostakovich's Trio No. 2. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 to $65. (Kozinn) HILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Sunday) This excellent all-male choir brings motets by Dufay and Josquin to the Music Before 1800 series, but the centerpiece of this program will be the ''Missa Media Vita in Morte Sumus'' by Nicolas Gombert, which the group just recorded for the ECM label. 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266; $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+.(Jeremy Eichler) MANHATTAN SCHOOL OF MUSIC ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Kurt Masur returned to the Manhattan School this week to lead his annual conducting seminar, and tonight, after many hours of master-class instruction, the students will show what they've learned by leading Mozart's Symphony No. 40, Tchaikovsky's ''Pathétique'' Symphony and Beethoven's ''Leonore'' Overture No. 3. Mr. Masur will also take a turn at the podium. 8, Manhattan School of Music, Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428; free, but tickets are required. (Eichler) MET ORCHESTRA (Sunday) The indomitable Anja Silja sings Schoenberg's ''Erwartung'' with James Levine and the Met players. 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $46 to $155. (Holland) MOZART GALA (Tonight) The last of three programs celebrating Mozart's 250th birthday takes place at the City University of New York Graduate Center, part of the university's free and admirable ''Great Music for a Great City'' series. The program offers duos, a string quartet and the sublime Clarinet Quintet. The dynamic Shanghai String Quartet, fresh from an arresting performance of Ligeti's challenging String Quartet No. 1 at Lincoln Center, will perform, along with the clarinetist Anthony McGill and the pianist Caroline Stoessinger. 7 p.m., 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, (212) 817-8215. (Tommasini) NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Its annual winter festival celebrates this year's birthday boy, Mozart. This final concert explores his piano works, comparing a concert grand with the smaller sound of a fortepiano, played by Vladimir Feltsman, who also conducts. Tonight at 8, Richardson Auditorium, Princeton, N.J.; tomorrow night at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark; Sunday afternoon at 3, State Theater, New Brunswick, N.J., (800) 255-3476; $20 to $75.

LUKE'S (Thursday) Roberto Abbado leads Peter Serkin and the ensemble in the premiere of Charles Wuorinen's ''Flying to Kahani,'' which includes a thematic segue into the next work, Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24.

(Holland) VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) This finely polished choir, directed by George Steel, sings liturgical works by the English Renaissance composers Tomkins and Weelkes. 8 p.m., Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $35. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. CHARLOTTE ADAMS AND DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Adams, a choreographer who teaches dance at the University of Iowa, will present ''Blind Dogs Sing of Love,'' a suite of dances that explore the mysteries and misunderstandings of the human heart, to music and sounds ranging from Bach and Mexican love songs to the mating calls of frogs and toads. 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Jennifer Dunning) BALLET BIARRITZ (Tuesday through Thursday) Direct from sunny France, the company will perform ''Création,'' which sees the story of the creation of the world as a metaphor for the history of dance. Or vice versa. The choreographer is the company director, Thierry Malandain, who trained and performed with the Paris Opera Ballet and has won numerous European awards for his work.

(Kinetz) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and Icon,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045. (Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average lifespan was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness was a shot in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what Latino art means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through April 16. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray, and artworks in various media relating to chess by Dorothea Tanning, Alberto Giacometti and John Cage, whose chessboard incorporates musical notation for a piano composition that you can hear on headphones. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Ken Johnson) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. through Feb. 19.(Johnson) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter) Galleries: 57th Street * 'Constructing Realities' See this conceptually ambitious exhibition for Andy Warhol's amazing, rarely seen 1965 film of an 83-year-old performer named Paul Swan who dances and recites poetry in exotic, Middle Eastern-style costumes with wonderfully un-self-conscious verve. A one-act play on video by Mike Kelley; videos transmitted from cell-phones for a project by Robert Whitman; a multiscreen video portrait of a man by Gary Hill; Stan Douglas's well-known film ''Der Sandemann''; and a selection of classic Diane Arbus photographs round out the show. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3293, through Feb. 4. (Johnson) * Maria Elena González This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. González encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea Jóhannes Atli Hinriksson: 'Mutiny' This young artist from Iceland makes intermittently funny, tedious, visually gripping and absurdly violent horror videos using small, clumsily cobbled-together puppets and sets. Featuring much spurting fake blood and other liquids, they could be the works of Napoleon Dynamite's demented cousin. Haswellediger, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 206-8955, through Feb. 4. (Johnson) * Warren Isensee Could this be Mr. Isensee's breakout show? His glowing grid, striped and concentric rectangle paintings play adroitly with conventions of Modernist abstraction and are almost hallucinogenically beautiful. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, (212) 223-2227, through Feb. 11. (Johnson) Florian Maier-Aichen A German photographer who lives part of the time in Los Angeles and will appear in this year's Whitney Biennial, Mr. Maier-Aichen makes large landscapes in which the convergence of natural imagery and photographic and digital technologies confounds the supposed transparency of photography. His ideas are not new, but the best pictures, including distant nighttime views of Los Angeles and a red-toned aerial picture of mountains, are sumptuous and subtly surrealistic. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Tim Roda A Boschian madness seems to have descended upon the young family of three featured in grainy, low-tech black-and-white photographs staged by the father, 28 year-old Mr. Roda, in old barns and dank industrial spaces. Grotesque prosthetic limbs, Freudian visual puns, foolish ceremonies, cross-dressing and moods of dour absurdity and cosmic mystery recur in these comical and creepy, dreamlike tableaus. Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-9494, through Feb. 4. (Johnson) Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Feb. 11. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo Kim Levin: 'Notes and Itineraries, 1976 - 2004' The longtime art critic for The Village Voice is the subject of a fascinating retrospective that views her career, as well as the history of the New York art scene, through the lens of ephemera that she has accumulated over the past 25 years, including postcard announcements, news releases and handwritten exhibition lists. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through Feb. 4. (Johnson) Other Galleries * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty Downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu, and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her death bed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) Brian DEwan and Leon DEwan: 'Dewanatron' Electronic musicians, eccentric inventors, sculptors and cousins, the Dewans create electronic sound-making machines housed in wall-mounted wooden containers that look like props for old sci-fi movies, or creations of a domestic hobbyist. Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-2144, through Jan 31. (Johnson) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot-tall weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) 'Humanitarians Not Heroes (Five-Alive)' This show presents offbeat promotional objects designed by various artists and issued by the exhibition's curator, the conceptualist Trong G. Nguyen, under the aegis of his own five-year-old organization called Humanitarians Not Heroes. They include ''Sound Capsule,'' a CD not to be played until a certain date in the future; T-shirts printed with birth and death dates of unspecified people; and fortune cookies containing sayings of George W. Bush. Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 645-2800, through Thursday.(Johnson) 'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson) Last Chance OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of the American Modernists active between World Wars I and II. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, Manhattan, (212) 570-4190; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, closes tomorrowthrough Jan. 28. (Smith) Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-4774; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * Met: 'FRA ANGELICO,' An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710; closes Sunday. (Smith) * Guillaume Pinard: 'expresso' Surrealistic, darkly comical black ball-point pen drawings evoke a childlike mind under the influence of Gumby, the Muppets and Japanese anime, and an animated video follows the adventures of two eyeballs with arms and legs through shape-shifting landscapes. Team, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-9219; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000; closes tomorrow. (Smith)"

DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. 'JUMP/CUT' Opens Feb. 12.

MCC Theater presents Glen Berger's gothic fairy tale set in the fictitious Scottish town of Brood (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 279-4200. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman from Feb. 14 through March 26. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'LOVELY DAY' Tiresome evening (1:15). Beckett Theater, Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway * 'APARTMENT 3A' Jeff Daniels's romance about a woman who lost her faith is written with wit, conviction and a real affection for its characters (1:30). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street; (212) 352-0255. (Zinoman) 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) 'SAFETY' A cynical, contrived portrayal of the life of a war photographer that attacks its subject with a heavy hand (1:25). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman). * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'HARVEST' Manjula Padmanabhan's sci-fi parable is a dark fantasy about a high-tech racket in body organs -- a cross between the 2002 thriller ''Dirty Pretty Things'' and an episode of ''The Twilight Zone.'' Based in Delhi, India, Ms. Padmanabhan wrote the play in 1996; this is its New York premiere (1:25). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710; closing Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban) * '(I AM) NOBODY'S LUNCH' The elusive nature of truth in a culture swamped with stuff that looks, sounds and smells like information -- but may be something a little more suspicious -- is the serious subject of this merrily unserious, vaudevillian romp through the anxious chatter of contemporary America. Snappy, scrappy and performed with a youthful blend of earnestness and deadpan razzmatazz by the buzzed-about downtown troupe the Civilians (1:30). 59E59, 59 East 59th Street; (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Nathan Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) 'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'LA PETITE JERUSALEM' (No rating, 96 minutes, in French and Hebrew) In her sensitive but overly schematic debut feature, the filmmaker Karin Albou reflects on the lives of two women living in an Orthodox Jewish enclave in a Parisian banlieue. (Lee) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee)'THE TOLLBOOTH' (No rating, 85 minutes) In ''The Tollbooth,'' 22-year-old Sarabeth Cohen (Marla Sokoloff) narrates the travails of her Jewish American family and her own coming of age. Written and directed with overwhelming earnestness by Debra Kirschner, the movie presents a sincere attempt to address the opposing tugs of tradition and modernity, but is undermined by dated dialogue and a reliance on stereotype. Would a modern Jewish mother really insist that a daughter's lesbianism was a reaction to overwork? (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series ANOTHER SPANISH CINEMA: FILMS IN CATALUNYA 1906-2006 (Through Feb. 14) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Catalan film continues this weekend with Antoni Ribas's ''Burned City'' (1976), one of the first Catalan-language films released after the death of Franco; and Vicente Aranda's ''Fata Morgana'' (1965-67), a Barcelona School collage that includes Pop Art, performance art and images from Richard Lester's Beatles movies. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13.) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year. It begins on Thursday with three films set in Iraq: ''The Tenth Planet, a Single Life in Baghdad'' (2004), Melis Birder's portrait of a secretary's everyday life; ''Terror'' (2005), the Termite TV Collective's visual essays about the current war; and ''The Liberace of Baghdad'' (2004), Sean McAllister's portrait of Samir Peter, a concert pianist reduced to playing in a hotel bar. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program honoring Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82) continues this weekend with ''The Bitter Tears of Petra van Kant'' (1972), his drama about an arrogant fashion designer (Margit Carstensen) who falls in love with a model (Hanna Schygulla). 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Feb. 12) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. This weekend's films include two stories set in Paris. ''The Last Flight'' (1931), selected by Lou Lumenick, is William Dieterle's Lost Generation drama about American fliers in France just after World War I. Ernst Lubitsch's ''Ninotchka'' (1939), selected by Leah Rozen, stars Greta Garbo as a stern Russian comrade seduced by everything Parisian. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) KARLOFF (Through Thursday) Film Forum's 14-movie festival honoring the great horror star Boris Karloff (1887-1969) begins this weekend with two double features. James Whale's ''Frankenstein'' (1931), starring Karloff as the monster, and Charles Brabin's ''Mask of Fu Manchu'' (1932), with Myrna Loy as co-star, will be shown today and tomorrow. Whale's tongue-in-cheek sequel ''Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935) and Karl Freund's tale of the return of Imhotep, ''The Mummy'' (1932), play on Sunday. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. THE ACADEMY IS , PANIC! AT THE DISCO, ACCEPTANCE, HELLOGOODBYE (Wednesday) Both the Chicago emo band the Academy Is and Panic! at the Disco were discovered by the pop-punk hitmakers Fall Out Boy. Both play a similar sort of anthemic, stop-start rock, the Academy Is boasting a histrionic front man, and Panic! at the Disco employing drum-machine mechanics. Acceptance and Hellogoodbye also play. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16.50 (sold out). (Laura Sinagra) BABY LOVES DISCO, THE RUB (Tomorrow) Because it's important to introduce your hipster child to good clubs and good music very early, the eclectic hip-hop, funk and global beat mavens DJ Ayres and Cosmo Baker spin a family-friendly afternoon play-date set. Later, they kick the kiddies out and proceed with their monthly dance party called the Rub. 2 to 5 p.m. (Baby Loves Disco), Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $10 ($40 family rate, limit of 5 people). The Rub begins at 10 p.m.; $5 for women; $10 for men. (Sinagra) GLENN BRANCA'S HALLUCINATION CITY: SYMPHONY 13 FOR 100 GUITARS (Tomorrow) One way to hear music is as a convergence of physics and psychology, exploring the ways certain wave forms affect human perception. Since the 1980's, Glenn Branca has been investigating the subtleties of tunings and overtones, creating instruments and compositions that provide an eerie immersion in pure sound. A hundred guitars should make a mighty noise. 7:30 p.m., Montclair State University, Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112; $25. (Jon Pareles) BURNSIDE PROJECT (Wednesday) The Burnside Project plays its guitars in the intermittently splashing indie-rock style of the slacker 90's but uses electronic burbles beneath them. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sinagra) CALLA (Tomorrow) Burrowing into the dark corners of New Wave's shiny, happy side, the band Calla offers something more than brooding and vintage black couture. 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sinagra) BLUES FALLIN' DOWN LIKE RAIN: THE MUSIC OF ELIZABETH COTTEN (Wednesday) The guitarist and composer Elizabeth Cotten (1895-1983) added a new dimension to finger-picking blues guitar with her upside-down, left-handed playing on songs like ''Freight Train.'' Her music is honored here by the guitarists Taj Mahal, Mike Seeger, Jolie Holland and Carla Kihlstedt and Mark Orton. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $35. (Sinagra) A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS (Thursday) The former hairdresser Michael Score is etched in the minds of 80's MTV watchers as much for his sculpturally ambitious hairstyles as for songs like ''I Ran'' and the hit ''Wishing.'' He has less hair and new bandmates now. 8 p.m., Crash Mansion, 199 the Bowery, at Spring Street, Lower East Side, (212) 982-0740; $20. (Sinagra) HACKENSAW BOYS (Tomorrow) The eight-member Virginia band Hackensaw Boys plays raw traditional bluegrass with lots of fast fiddling, banjoing, speedy stomps and ripe hollers. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) HEM (Thursday) Against an orchestral backdrop and acoustic guitars, Sally Ellyson whispers and coos Dan Messe's songs in muslin tones. It's a style that recalls dreamy early 90's indie Americana pop. 8:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9958; $20 to $45. (Sinagra) HIGH ON FIRE (Tonight) This dark metal band's recent work with the producer Steve Albini highlights its precision. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra) BILLY JOEL (Thursday) The piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50 (sold out). (Sinagra) THE JUAN MACLEAN (Tomorrow) These know-it-all hipster musicologists play electro disco that sounds like post-industrial slackers having a party in a junk shop, dancing freely. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111 ; $15. (Sinagra) DANIEL LANOIS (Tonight) The producer and atmospheric musician Daniel Lanois here showcases the soundtrack for his experimental film ''Silvio'' with a group that includes the vocalist Lori Anna Reid, the guitarist Jim Wilson and the drummer Brian Blade. 8:30, Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 and $35. (Sinagra) JENNY LEWIS WITH THE WATSON TWINS (Sunday) The Rilo Kiley frontwoman Jenny Lewis's solo material is inspired by Laura Nyro-style 70's white soul. Her combination of school-recital fussiness and barely-caught cry is in fine form, but it's her vocal tone and phrasing that make her special. Especially here, where her pointy songbird desperation is augmented by gospel's Watson Twins. 7 p.m., Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20. (Sinagra) LOW (Tonight and Monday) For more than a decade, this Duluth, Minn., trio has been writing storm-cloud songs that evoke expansive sadness and long, cold distance. Tonight at 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $15 (sold out). Monday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra) AIMEE MANN (Thursday) Ms. Mann's recent concept album about two addicts in the 70's who meet at the Virginia fairgrounds features the astute, sad lyrics and low-key but enduring melodic hooks that this singer-songwriter is known for. Chuck Prophet also plays. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $25 to $35. (Sinagra) RICKY MARTIN (Monday) This Puerto Rican pop superstar, who has been keeping a relatively low profile since his 90's heyday, returns to the spotlight. You wonder if he will incorporate any reggaéton into his act. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; $50.50 to $120.50.(Sinagra) MATT POND P.A., DIOS (MALOS) (Tuesday) The band Matt Pond P.A. has lots of nicely formed indie-pop songs, none very memorable. Live, however, the band, which features a cello, delivers with a forceful crispness. Dios (Malos), a laid-back California quintet, plays shaggy indie-rock marked by questing vocals, dream-pop harmonies and a kind of acoustic-electronic psychedelia that conjures a couch daydream rather than a desert drive. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side; (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) GEAROID OhALLMHURAIN AND PATRICK OURCEAU (Tonight) The University of Missouri professor and concertina player Gearoid OhAllmhurain specializes in the traditional songs of his native County Clare. He plays with a sometime collaborator, the French fiddler Patrick Ourceau. 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950; $15 free to members and N.Y.U. students. (Sinagra) RAIN (Tonight) Bi (pronounced Bee), the Korean soap-opera heartthrob and pan-Asian pop star whose name translates as Rain, has soaked up English-speaking pop, from Michael Jackson to Usher.

(Sinagra) SIGUR ROS, AMINA (Thursday) The Icelandic atmospherists Sigur Ros continue to pursue the hope and dread of open expanse and to conjure with their sung gibberish a kind of ur-poetry. Amina is an all-female string quartet that similarly muses on vastness. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, , (212) 465-6741; $38 to $58.50. (Sinagra) Supergrass (Thursday) This buoyant, hooky mid-90's Brit-pop band had a sound more glammy than Oasis's and heftier than Blur's.

WARD (Tonight) The echoing guitar folk-pop songs of this singer-songwriter combine heartfelt campfire zeal with the ruminative sadness of midtempo 70's AM radio hits.

(Chinen) ADAM MAKOWICZ TRIO (Wednesday through Feb. 11) Mr. Makowicz has been a powerful if sometimes elusive presence in jazz since moving to the United States from Poland nearly 30 years ago; his crystalline piano technique is well supported here by the drummer Al Foster and the bassist George Mraz. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA, MARK DRESSER, GERRY HEMINGWAY (Tonight) This is strenuous experimentalism, but not without a point: Mr. Mahanthappa's flinty alto saxophone tone should abrade effectively against Mr. Dresser's probing bass playing and Mr. Hemingway's textural percussion. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $10.

(Chinen) COOPER-MOORE (Sunday) Cooper-Moore is an extreme polyglot, even by avant-garde standards, as he demonstrates in two afternoon sets: first singing, manipulating electronics and playing percussion with the cellist Nioka Workman and the keyboardist Matt Motel; then playing piano and a host of other instruments, alongside Assif Tsahar on reeds and Chad Taylor on drums. 1:30 and 3 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681; cover, $10 per set; $7 for students; free for children 14 and under.

But he has only rarely led his own group in a New York club residency, which makes this quartet engagement -- with the pianist Michael Weiss, the bassist John Webber and the drummer Lewis Nash -- a sort of landmark event. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum.

Monday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Bernard Holland) 'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' (Tomorrow) Alfano's elegant, ambling ''Cyrano'' returns for a matinee, with Antonio Barasorda once again filling in for Plácido Domingo in the title role. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6200; $220 tickets remain.(Holland) 'RIGOLETTO' (Wednesday) The soprano Anna Netrebko and the tenor Rolando Villazón, opera's hottest vocal couple of late, bring star appeal and impressive artistry to the Met's 1989 Otto Schenk production of Verdi's ''Rigoletto.'' With her dusky-toned and exciting voice, Ms. Netrebko gives an unusually emotional portrayal of Gilda. Mr. Villazón infuses the role of the Duke of Mantua with an ardent voice, Verdian style and virile energy. The baritone Carlo Guelfi makes a stolid but finally sympathetic Rigoletto. Plácido Domingo, who knows a thing or two about the lead tenor role, conducts. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The soprano Angela Gheorghiu, who first gained international attention for her portrayal of Verdi's Violetta in performances conducted by Georg Solti, sings the role at the Met. Like others before her, she will have to contend with Franco Zeffirelli's overblown production. Still, she should be abetted by Jonas Kaufmann, a handsome and highly touted German tenor, who is making his Met debut. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Tuesday. (Tommasini) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tonight) The Metropolitan Opera evidently thinks that Julie Taymor's pageant of a ''Zauberflöte,'' with its wonderful puppets and game-show-style sets, is attraction enough that it can fill it with a less-known, largely homegrown cast. The spectacle is undeniable and sometimes beautiful, but ultimately seems empty without stronger musical values, though Mary Dunleavy does her best as a capable Pamina. Still, the Met is evidently right, because tonight's performance will probably be sold out. 8, Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; returned tickets may be available. (Anne Midgette) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the city's more inviting settings for chamber music.

(Eichler) MICHAEL GORDON (Tomorrow) This inventive composer has undertaken several collaborations in recent years with the filmmaker Bill Morrison, whose preferred medium at the moment is disintegrating silent film stock from around the 1920's. The poor condition of the film creates imagery of its own -- bubbles, blobs and amorphous shapes that recall those of the psychedelic light shows of the late 1960's. More to the point, it usually matches the impulses of Mr. Gordon's eclectic music. The program includes the premiere of ''Who by Water,'' as well as two older works, ''Light Is Calling'' and ''Gotham.'' 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20.

(Eichler) STEVEN ISSERLIS (Tuesday) A distinctive and quirky artist, this cellist is joined by the pianist Ana-Maria Vera for his New York recital debut, a program with an intriguing twist: every composer on the program acted as a mentor to the one after him, from Mendelssohn and Schumann to Suk and Martinu. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Midgette) JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) In the spirit of its idiosyncratic founder, Jens Nygaard, this feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and major works. This week the ensemble's guests are Désirée Halac, a mezzo-soprano; Philippe Quint, a violinist; and Benjamin Hochman, a pianist, who will collaborate on a tasty program that includes songs by Brahms, the Schumann Piano Trio No. 2, a wind sextet by Reinecke and a string quintet by Zemlinsky. 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259; $10 to $25. (Kozinn) STEVEN MACKEY (Thursday) At his best, this American composer writes pieces that draw from his training as a rigorous modernist and his experience as a dynamic rock guitarist. He will talk about this, while introducing and participating in a program of his works in one of Carnegie Hall's Making Music programs. The Brentano String Quartet and the Prism saxophone quartet are among the performers. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20. (Tommasini) EKATERINA MECHETINA (Sunday) This 20-something Russian pianist, who studied in Moscow, won the World Piano Competition in Cincinnati in 2004, and this weekend claims a New York recital as her prize. Her advance billing advertises a strikingly full program, with works by eight composers, from Mozart to Shchedrin. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $15 and $20. (Midgette) THOMAS MEGLIORANZA (Thursday) Working with a pianist and a violinist, this adventurous young baritone offers works by Aaron Jay Kernis, Jorge Martín, John Rommereim and others.

This weekend and Tuesday, Jeffrey Kahane conducts and is the soloist for two piano concertos, and also leads the E-flat Sinfonia Concertante. Beginning Thursday, Lorin Maazel conducts four performances of the last three symphonies. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6000; $26 to $94. (Holland) ORLANDO CONSORT (Tuesday) This a cappella ensemble has made several beautifully sung thematic recordings for Harmonia Mundi, with texts so copious that the label has produced them as miniature hard-cover books. The latest, ''The Rose, the Lily and the Whortleberry,'' explores the use of floral imagery by medieval and Renaissance composers to describe both physical and heavenly love. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $25. (Kozinn) EMMANUEL PAHUD and YEFIM BRONFMAN (Tuesday) Mr. Pahud, the popular Swiss flutist, is joined by the accomplished pianist for sonatas by Reinecke, Brahms and Prokofiev. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $44 to $52.

It continues tomorrow with Dawn Upshaw, the Kronos Quartet and the Andalucian Dogs on a program of arrangements and original music by Mr. Golijov including his ''Ayre,'' a heady song cycle that draws on the folk and pop traditions of the Mediterranean.

Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street; Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $65 tomorrow, $45 on Wednesday.

The program includes songs by Liszt, Beethoven, Falla, Schumann and others. 8 pm., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; sold out, but returned tickets may be available.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Art Fairs '10TH ANNIVERSARY BLACK FINE ART SHOW' Most of the significant names in African-American art history will be represented in a fair that is unique in New York for its dedication to black artists. The general quality is usually uneven, but chances are you will find lots of interesting things, including works by 19th-century landscape painters like Edward Bannister and Henry Tanner; Harlem Renaissance artists like Aaron Douglas and Hale Woodruff; modernists like Romare Beardon and Norman Lewis; and postmodernists like Danny Simmons and Carrie Mae Weems. The Puck Building, 295 Lafayette Street, at Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 925-5257, through Sunday. Hours: Today, noon to 8 p.m.; tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $15; students, $10. (Ken Johnson) Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and Icon,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045. (Holland Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average lifespan was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness was a shot in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) * New York Public Library: 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS,' through Feb. 12. Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069. (Smith) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) * P.S. 1: 'The Painted World,' through March 13. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. (See above.) (Johnson) The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through April 16. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray, and artworks in various media relating to chess by Dorothea Tanning, Alberto Giacometti and John Cage, whose chessboard incorporates musical notation for a piano composition that you can hear on headphones. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Johnson) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century., right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. Too, he was a superb colorist, assigning psychological properties to each color, red in particular, which he considered symbolic of power and energy. Among the best works here are his last ones, landscapes that have the magic of Expressionist theater, with houses, trees and the like assuming almost human presences. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) (Johnson) Galleries: Uptown The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter) Galleries: 57th Street * Maria Elena González This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. González encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter) * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea MIKE CLOUD Mike Cloud is a young artist of the moment, with a project exhibition at P.S. 1, photo-collages in ''Frequency'' at the Studio Museum in Harlem, and new paintings in a solo at Protetch. The work, and his Protetch show in particular, is a tough nut to crack. But rude, funny and meaty, it's well worth the attempt. Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6999, through Feb. 11. (Cotter) ORI GERSHT: 'THE FOREST' This briefly mesmerizing film consists of silent, panning shots of immense trees interrupted at intervals by the sight and sound of one of them falling violently and slowly to the ground. The mood is somber, even tragic, but in the end, too easily won. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766; through Feb 11. (Smith) * Warren Isensee Could this be Mr. Isensee's breakout show? His glowing grid, striped and concentric rectangle paintings play adroitly with conventions of Modernist abstraction and are almost hallucinogenically beautiful. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, (212) 223-2227, through Feb. 11. (Johnson) ERWIN OLAF The large, carefully staged photographs of people in midcentury American clothes and environments by this successful Dutch commercial photographer look like the dreams of a deeply depressed Norman Rockwell. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) ROXY PAINE The main attraction of this extraordinarily inventive sculptor's show is a computer-controlled sandblaster that is slowly sculpturing a piece of sandstone into something resembling a topographical model of a Southwestern landscape. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) AMY RATHBONE: 'UNBENT' Operating somewhere between Richard Tuttle and Ree Morton, this artist embeds wires of different lengths and colors in the wall to create whiskery textures, clustered hoops or trailing lines. The resulting wall drawings are endearing, if a bit too close to abstract New Yorker cartoons. Priska C. Juschka Fine Art, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-4320; through Feb. 11. (Smith) Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Feb. 11. (Johnson) Other Galleries JOHN BRATTIN: 'THE TRIUMPH OF NIGHT' John Brattin's short film ''The Triumph of Night'' is like a basement-tapes version of ''Wuthering Heights.'' Written and directed by Mr. Brattin, its title lifted from a book of Edith Wharton ghost stories, it delivers a Hollywood-ready Victorian plot in an ingeniously homespun package. Participant Inc., 95 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 254-4334, through Feb. 12. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty Downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu, and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her death bed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot-tall weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) *'DAVID HAMMONS: THE AUTHORIZED RETROSPECTIVE' How do you do a show if you don't have art? Use copies. How do you get copies? Find photographs of the original art. That's what Triple Candie has done with David Hammons's work. The gallery photocopied illustrations of existing, or once existing, Hammons pieces from books and magazines and downloaded others from the Internet. They then taped the 8 1/2 -by-11 prints to the gallery wall. The result: an homage that is very much in this important artist's maverick, dematerialized spirit. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783, through Feb. 12.(Cotter) Last Chance * 'Constructing Realities' See this conceptually ambitious exhibition for Andy Warhol's amazing, rarely seen 1965 film of an 83-year-old performer named Paul Swan who dances and recites poetry in exotic, Middle Eastern-style costumes with wonderfully un-self-conscious verve. A one-act play on video by Mike Kelley; videos transmitted from cellphones for a project by Robert Whitman; a multiscreen video portrait of a man by Gary Hill; Stan Douglas's well-known film ''Der Sandemann''; and a selection of classic Diane Arbus photographs round out the show. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 421-3293; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * Katy Grannan: 'Mystic Lake' Ms. Grannan makes exceptionally intimate photographs of nonprofessional models posing outdoors partly or fully unclothed. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) Kim Levin: 'Notes and Itineraries, 1976 - 2004' The longtime art critic for The Village Voice is the subject of a fascinating retrospective that views her career, as well as the history of the New York art scene, through the lens of ephemera that she has accumulated over the past 25 years, including postcard announcements, news releases and handwritten exhibition lists. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3232; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION' With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' (A complete retrospective of Pixar animated films concludes with ''The Incredibles'' (2004), the Oscar-winning story of the Parr family, superheroes trying not to be so super.) In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as those films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; closes Monday. (Smith) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE' For 40 years, Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above); closes Sunday. (Kimmelman)"

Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, (212) 307-4100. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RING OF FIRE' The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico García Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CHRISTINE JORGENSON REVEALS' Bradford Louryk meticulously lip-syncs a fascinating hourlong interview about gender and sexuality with Ms. Jorgenson, whose sex-change operation in the 1950's was big news (1:00). The Studio Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Zinoman) 'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who retailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'FAMILY SECRETS' Performing old jokes with meticulous detail, Sherry Glaser in her solo show brings to life three generations of a Jewish family (1:30). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman) 'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka) 'GREY GARDENS' As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' A solid revival of one of Shakespeare's problem plays in which the director Beatrice Terry has opted to emphasize the humor, especially in the scenes of comic relief. A staging with handsome costumes and that for the most part boasts a fine cast, whose members have made some smart choices (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Wilborn Hampton) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Honor Moore) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) * 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON' A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Moore) 'WALK THE MOUNTAIN' Jude Narita's one-woman show ''Walk the Mountain,'' about the hellish effects of the Vietnam War, offers nuanced accounts rather than a mere litany of horrors. (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Laura Weinert) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'SAVAGES' Lurking somewhere in this stiff new play by Anne Nelson is a compelling op-ed piece yearning to be set free. Examining a little-known episode from the Philippines-American war at the turn of the last century, the author of the popular play ''The Guys'' argues that the United States involvement in Iraq echoes that previous mess. Unfortunately, the play has too much information to impart to allow time for nuanced drama to emerge (1:30). Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) '33 TO NOTHING' A band break up while playing break-up music in Grant James Varjas's comic, sometimes poignant play. Music performed by the actors. Argo Theater Company, at the Bottle Factory Theater, 195 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gwen Orel) 'WE USED TO GO OUT' Jason Mantzoukas and Jessica St. Clair revive the tradition of male-female comedy team in this appealing sketch about a disintegrating romance (1:00). UCB Theater, 306 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9176. ( Zinoman) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BLUFF' Jeffrey Sweet's mostly comic tale of a young New York couple whose tentative romance is disrupted by a boorish stepfather has great fun playing with the audience through direct address and such, but it is executed with too much smirking (1:25). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) * 'FAT BOY' John Clancy's knockabout satire is blessed by a roaring performance by Del Pentecost as the round, murdering title character (1:30). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. ( Zinoman) 'HEDDA GABLER' In the title role of Ibsen's destructively dissatisfied heroine, Cate Blanchett is giving roughly a dozen of the liveliest performances to be seen this year, all at the same time, in the Sydney Theater Company's visiting production. A mere one or two at this level of intensity would have been enough. But she remains compellingly watchable in Robyn Nevin's hyped-up, spasmodic production (2:25). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'MEASURE FOR PLEASURE' A mock-Restoration comedy by David Grimm. Seeking to do a little restoration work of his own, he inserts great chunks of fresh dirt into every nook, cranny and convention of an old form. Acted to the hilt by a first-rate company under the direction of Peter DuBois, this tirelessly ribald comedy will tickle, offend or simply bore in measures that will vary according to your taste for blatantly vulgar sexual comedy (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday.(Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque, a k a the singer JoJo) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly.(Neil Genzlinger) Ask the Dust (R, 117 minutes) A story about being young and hungry -- for fame, for women, for food -- in Los Angeles during the 1930's. Robert Towne wrote and directed this adaptation of the John Fante novel, and Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek star. (Manohla Dargis) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott) 'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott) 'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Dargis) * 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Holden) * Duck Season (R, 87 minutes) Two boys, one girl, a pizza-delivery man and a pan of pot brownies equals one charmingly low-key film about friendship and the ecstasy of communion. The Mexican filmmaker Fernando Eimbcke is a talent to watch. (Dargis) * 'FIND ME GUILTY' (R, 124 minutes) This gripping courtroom drama, directed by Sidney Lumet, now 81 and near the top of his game, is based on the 1987-88 trial of 20 members of the New Jersey-based Lucchese crime family on multiple counts. Vin Diesel turns in a sensational performance as Giacomo DiNorscio, better known as Jackie Dee, who broke from the ranks of his fellow defendants to be his own defense lawyer. (Holden) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) * 'PUZZLEHEAD' (No rating, 81 minutes) In a bleak and barren future, a lonely scientist builds a robot companion called Puzzlehead and trains him to spy on the pale, jittery salesgirl whom the scientist has been secretly coveting. Mining the Frankenstein myth and finding psychosexual gold, the writer and director James Bai creates a doomed love triangle around cannibalistic themes, Freudian passions and the understanding that even a tin man can have a heart. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'SHADOW: DEAD RIOT' (No rating, 90 minutes) An experimental women's prison is overrun by zombies in this berserk little B movie, the low-budget love child of ''The Evil Dead'' and ''Reform School Girls.'' (Nathan Lee) 'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Lee) '16 BLOCKS' (PG-13, 105 minutes) If Richard Donner's presence suggests that his new action flick, ''16 Blocks,'' is a throwback to the 1980's, so does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally. Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. (Dargis) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist in the 1940's, arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis) 'ULTRAVIOLET' (PG-13, 80 minutes) The latest in movies structured around eyewear and abdominals, ''Ultraviolet'' stars Milla Jovovich as a genetically modified human -- part vampire, part chameleon, all model -- and one of the many victims of a government experiment to improve on nature. Directed by Kurt Wimmer with a fine eye for the preferences of 12-year-old boys, ''Ultraviolet'' cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly. (Catsoulis) 'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-''dumb'' future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon (winner of the Academy Award for best actress), who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work continues this weekend with Joseph von Sternberg's ''Shanghai Express'' (1932), in which Wong and Marlene Dietrich play ladies of the evening whose train is hijacked; ''The Flame of Love'' (1930), about a dancer in pre-Revolutionary Russia; and ''Daughter of the Dragon'' (1931), about the avenging daughter of Fu Manchu. 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10.

Gregg Allman, the band's keyboardist and main singer, is more than ever its center, since its co-founder Dickey Betts is estranged from the band.

(Sinagra) DESTROYER (Tuesday) The Vancouver malcontent and Destroyer mastermind Dan Bejar's pointy vocal delivery and disjointed tantrums are not mitigated by his recent move toward indie-pop lushness, but they're so self-possesed, you wouldn't want them to be. 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $14.

(Sinagra) EISLEY (Wednesday) Four of the waifs in this pop quartet are siblings, home-schooled in a small town in Texas by Christian parents who supported their Radiohead obsession.

The Brazilian Seu Jorge may be best known here for his lilting samba covers of David Bowie songs in Wes Anderson's movie ''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.''

(Sinagra) LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES (Tonight) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960's boogaloo, 70's Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rapping, while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-on's somewhere between charm and smarm. Midnight, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $20. (Pareles) LOVE IS ALL (Tonight and tomorrow) One of the most exciting discoveries of the year, this Swedish band evokes the angular spunk of 1970's feminist post-punk bands like Liliput.

Opera 'LA BOHÈME' (Tonight) James Robinson's production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. At the first performance, Kelly Kaduce made an appealing Mimi, pairing her character's physical weakness with focused vocal strength. Gerard Powers sang Rodolfo with a solid top but a thinner middle range. Grant Youngblood was a robust Marcello and Shannah Timms a suitably sassy Musetta. Steven White kept things on track in the pit. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $110.(Jeremy Eichler) 'FIDELIO' (Tonight and Tuesday) The director Jürgen Flimm's strikingly contemporary and deeply humane production of Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' which opened at the Met in 2000, is back. So is the soprano Karita Mattila, who gives a courageous and vocally radiant portrayal of Leonore, opera's most valiant and devoted wife. The conductor Paul Nadler has taken over for the injured James Levine, who has withdrawn for the rest of the season, and though Mr. Nadler is no Mr. Levine, he does honorable work. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini) 'DON GIOVANNI' (Sunday and Thursday) Neither objectionable nor particularly fresh or insightful, Harold Prince's 1989 staging of this great Mozart opera is a good, basic presentation of the work. The New York City Opera's opening cast includes Christopher Schaldenbrand in the title role; Robert Gierlach as Leporello; Hanan Alattar as Zerlina; Orla Boylan as Donna Anna. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $110. (Allan Kozinn) 'LYSISTRATA' (Tomorrow) The composer Mark Adamo's fantastical operatic adaptation of Aristophanes' antiwar comedy had its premiere last year at the Houston Grand Opera. That production is now playing at the New York City Opera. Mr. Adamo's score is bustling and hyper-rhythmic, but sometimes too dense. And the vocal writing is needlessly punishing. Still, he takes seriously the story of Athenian and Spartan women who join forces to refuse their husbands and lovers sex until the men stop waging a seemingly endless war. At its best the opera becomes a somber meditation on the intertwining of passion and aggression. The production is delightful and the youthful cast, despite the challenges of singing the music, wins you over. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 to $110. (Tommasini) 'MAZEPPA' (Tomorrow, Monday and Thursday) Tchaikovsky's epic 1884 opera about the ruthless 17th-century Ukrainian separatist Ivan Mazeppa is an anguished, probing and noble work. The Metropolitan Opera deserves thanks for presenting its first production of this neglected masterpiece, inspiringly conducted by Valery Gergiev. A cast of mostly Russian singers bring conviction and palpable authority to their work, especially the baritone Nikolai Putilin as the wizened Mazeppa and the soprano Olga Guryakova as his impressionable wife. The musical performance is so compelling you can almost ignore Yuri Alexandrov's jumbled and trashy projection, which clutters the opera with symbolism. Tomorrow and Monday at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $320. (Tommasini) METROPOLITAN OPERA GRAND FINALS CONCERT (Sunday) Opera professionals have descended on New York in their annual spring migration to hear (and judge) the latest round of talent gleaned from the nationwide Metropolitan Opera Council Auditions. Ben Heppner is the host of the concert of finalists (with a couple of ringers from past years thrown in), and the winners are announced at the end of the show. 3 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; remaining tickets, $25 to $100. (Anne Midgette) 'LUISA MILLER' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Barbara Frittoli canceled the run. Neil Shicoff was sick on opening night. Veronica Villarroel got sick for a subsequent performance. So who knows whom you can expect to hear in Verdi's midperiod opera this week? Ms. Villarroel and Mr. Shicoff are supposed to sing tomorrow, and on Wednesday, the journeyman Eduardo Villa will join a soprano whom even the Met says is yet to be determined. What is sure: Carlos Alvarez, who pumps out sound in a warm unvaried baritone, and James Morris, who takes ''stentorian'' off the pitch chart altogether. Maurizio Benini adds what excitement he can in the pit. Tomorrow and Wednesday night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $36 to $320 tomorrow, $26 to $320 on Wednesday. (Midgette) 'THE MOST HAPPY FELLA' (Tomorrow) Frank Loesser thought of his 1956 masterpiece ''The Most Happy Fella'' as a ''musical with a lot of music,'' not as an opera. Still, this musically sophisticated and disarming musical is a good fit for the New York City Opera, whose charming production directed by Philip Wm. McKinley ends tomorrow night. The actor Paul Sorvino, making his City Opera debut, inhabits the title role of Tony Esposito, the paunchy, insecure but good-hearted Italian immigrant vineyard owner in Napa Valley of the late 1920's. Mr. Sorvino's voice, though, is pretty raw and shaky. He's at his best when he doesn't care about how he sounds and just lets go. The rest of the cast, mostly from the musical theater world, is wonderful. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $45 to $110. (Tommasini) 'ORPHEUS DESCENDING' (Tonight through Sunday) Bruce Saylor's opera, based on the play by Tennessee Williams and with a libretto by J. D. McClatchy, opened in 1994 and hasn't been seen since. College conservatories are becoming a safe haven for the protection of new operatic work: Queens College, where Mr. Saylor is a professor, is now presenting the work's first-ever revival. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, Sunday afternoon at 3, Goldstein Theater, Colden Center, Queens College, Kissena Boulevard and the Long Island Expressway, Flushing, (718) 793-8080; $20 on Friday and Sunday, $22 tomorrow, $2 discount for 65+. (Midgette) Classical Music * BACH COLLEGIUM JAPAN (Monday) This Japanese period-instrument ensemble, led by its founder, Masaaki Suzuki, gave an extraordinarily powerful account of its namesake's ''St. Matthew Passion'' at its Carnegie Hall debut in 2003. It returns without its chorus this time, for an all-Bach program that includes the Orchestral Suite No. 2, the Harpsichord Concerto in D minor, the Concerto for Two Violins and Orchestra in D minor and the ''Brandenburg'' Concerto No. 5. 7:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $42 to $55. (Kozinn) BASICALLY BACH (Tonight and Tuesday) This four-concert festival celebrating the 321st anniversary of Bach's birth got under way last week and concludes with two programs shared by Bach and Handel. Tonight, Richard Westenburg leads the Musica Sacra Orchestra and Elem Eley, a baritone, in selections from the Anna Magdalena Bach Notebook, as well as Bach's ''Brandenburg'' Concerto No. 2 and Handel's ''Water Music'' Suite in G. On Tuesday, the program includes Handel's ''Water Music'' Suite in F along with a motet, cantata and orchestral suite by Bach. 8 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 868-4444; $15 to $75. (Kozinn) * KRONOS QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday) Probably the best things the Kronos Quartet brings to concert life are a breadth of interest in contemporary music and an inventive approach to presenting it. The first of its three concerts this weekend includes Alexandra Du Bois's ''Night Songs,'' a meditation on the early 1940's diaries of Etty Hillesum; Michael Gordon's ''Sad Park,'' which includes recordings of children talking about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the String Quartet No. 3 by the Polish composer Henryk Gorecki. In the second concert, the Kronos is joined by David Barsamian and Howard Zinn, who will speak about the music that the Kronos is performing, with the group making its repertory choices based on the directions the conversation takes. Also among the guests are the composer-performers Walter Kitundu and Tanya Tagaq Gillis, whose music will be heard. And in the third program, the group explores recent music from Azerbaijan, including works by Franghiz Ali-Zadeh and Rahman Asadollahi, both of whom will perform with the quartet. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35. (Kozinn) JAIME LAREDO AND LEON FLEISHER (Wednesday) Two distinguished musicians, the violinist Jaime Laredo and the pianist Leon Fleisher, play all three of Brahms's violin sonatas, sublime and exciting works that complement each other on a program. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Tommasini) * MAGNUS LINDBERG (Tonight) This fantastic Finnish eclectic is the subject of a Composer Portrait concert that includes his Clarinet Quintet (1992), ''Related Rocks'' (1997), ''Linea d'Ombra'' (1981) and Duo Concertante. Timothy Weiss conducts the International Contemporary Ensemble. 8, Miller Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $20. (Kozinn) SEYMOUR LIPKIN (Monday) A veteran Beethoven interpreter and an eminent pianist who teaches at the Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute of Music, Seymour Lipkin continues his exploration of Beethoven's keyboard works with a recital presented by the American Beethoven Society. The program offers the wildly inventive Fantasy in G minor and the monumental Variations on a Theme of Diabelli. 7 p.m., Lang Recital Hall, Hunter College, North Building, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 772-4448; $15, $10 seniors/students, $8 members of the American Beethoven Society. (Tommasini) LONDON PHILHARMONIC (Sunday) ''Musical conductors'' is a popular game this spring season: lots of conductors are canceling, and Kurt Masur is the latest casualty. Replacing him in this weekend's concert is Yan Pascal Tortelier, who will accompany the pianist Garrick Ohlsson in Schumann's Piano Concerto in A, then essay Mahler's First with this fine orchestra. 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69. (Midgette) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT (Tonight) This young chamber group takes on Central European music old and new: Brahms and Schumann, then Schoenberg and Webern. 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $30.(Bernard Holland) NEW YORK COLLEGIUM (Tonight) Andrew Parrott and his early music ensemble in a program that focuses on the relationship between Telemann and Handel, with Telemann's ''Donner-Ode'' and Part II from Handel's ''Alexander Feast.'' 8 p.m., Church of St. Vincent Ferrer, Lexington Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 717-9246; $30 to $50, students $20, 65+ $27.

(Holland) SKAMPA STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) This acclaimed ensemble of young musicians from Prague is being presented by the People's Symphony Concerts in a program of quartets by Beethoven and Mozart and, with the violist Scott St. John joined in, Mozart great String Quintet in C, K. 515.

(Cash only.) (Dunning) TERE O'CONNOR DANCE (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Audiences and reviewers tend to feel passionately about Mr. O'Connor's choreography, loving or hating it with equal intensity. Somehow Mr. O'Connor has lived through it all and continued to produce dances. This one is called ''Baby,'' which he describes as exploding the metaphor of time passing. You decide. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25. (Dunning) OLLOM DANCE THEATER (Thursday) John Ollom celebrates Women's History Month with ''Anatomy of Woman,'' which tells three stories in dance about women. 8 p.m., Clark Studio Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 592-0103; $45.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. Her works do not lend themselves to easy deciphering, but her magic with materials and her daring compositional imagination draw you in. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Roberta Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff) NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work, from his dense, Cubist-style oil, ''When God Considered the Creation of the Plants'' (1913), to a beautifully stylized rendering of the jazz singer and dancer Josephine Baker (1927) to labyrinthine compositions like ''Or the Mocked Mocker'' (1930). 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck) P.S. 1: Jessica Stockholder: 'Of Standing Float Roots in Thin Air,' through May 1. A soaring, cannily designed installation -- made of airborne plastic bins, electric lights, orange extension cords and an old armchair topping a wooden tower -- by a sculptor known for orchestrating productive collisions of formalism and consumerism. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Ken Johnson) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. Beauty is hard to come by. Check out, among other things, Paul Chan's digital animation of shadowy objects like cellphones and bicycles, floating upward, Wizard of Oz-like, while bodies tumble down, the work cast as if it were light from a tall window slanting onto the floor of a dark room. And also Pierre Huyghe's film, shot in Antarctica and Central Park. It's really gorgeous: crosscut between day and night, fiction and reality, it encapsulates the show's operative but ultimately airy metaphor about the slippery state of art now. (''Day for Night'' is the biennial's first-ever title, after the François Truffaut film.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown Tony Cragg: 'Five Bottles' In the early 1980's, this eminent English sculptor made flat, mosaiclike works out of found colored plastic objects and fragments. This show presents a set of five wall-works, each representing a different giant colored bottle composed of toys, combs, cigarette lighters and other pieces of ordinary commercial detritus. Vivian Horan, 35 East 67th Street, (212) 517-9410, through April 21. (Johnson) Jim Shaw: 'My Mirage 1986- 91' This amazingly inventive California-based artist first became widely known for a series of about 170 works, all measuring 17 by 14 inches, that chronicles the life of a white suburban boy named Billy, from innocent youth to druggy degradation to born-again salvation. The 30 pieces from the series in this show variously imitate comic strips, acid-rock posters, thrift store paintings, comic greeting cards and many other pop culture forms. Skarstedt, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 737-2060, through April 1. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea * MARK LECKeY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark, and adds another twist to the convoluted history of appropriation art. GBE@Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, (212) 627-5258, through April 22. (Smith) Rachel Whiteread: 'Bibliography' Cardboard boxes cast in plaster are displayed in monotonous profusion singly and in groups by this British sculptor who once made a concrete cast of the inside of a whole house. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through April 1. (Johnson) Other Galleries * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed; punk and new wave rock assailed the ears; graffiti spread like kudzu; and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. Granted that much of Downtown was throwaway stuff, too ephemeral and experimental to last, for better or for worse, it helped to change the definition of what art and artists might be. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) Last Chance * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' . The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040; closes Sunday. (Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS' Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400; closes Sunday. (Smith) * William Nicholson Though less well known than his son, the British abstract painter Ben Nicholson, Sir William Nicholson was a successful artist in his day. The mostly small landscapes, portraits and Chardinesque still lifes in this beautiful show offer transporting fusions of paint and imagery. Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 563-4474; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) Barbara Probst Ms. Probst displays pairs and groups of photographs made using electronically connected cameras able to shoot scenes from different angles at exactly the same time. Seeing a family crossing the street in black and white from the top of a building and close-up in color from street level creates a philosophically intriguing collapse of the normal space-time continuum. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-7372; closes tomorrowthrough March 25. (Johnson) THE STUDIO VISIT The studio visit, a time-honored ritual that everyone in the art world has both endured and learned from, is taken to its limit in Exit Art's latest exhibition marathon. Each of the 160 mostly short videos represents one artist's idea of, play on, or substitute for, a studio visit. It is a show that often cries out for a fast-forward button, but there are some notable gems -- for example, by Joyce Pensato, Cynthia von Buhler, Ida Applebroog, Bruce Pearson, Lance Wakeling, Taylor McKimens, Paul Wirhun, Elisabeth Kley, Christy Gast and Kim Jones. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745; closes tomorrow. (Smith)"

Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL' This Theater for a New Audience production inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production in which there is nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role. Darko Tresnjak and his cast find a way to make the play's troubled romance, between the adoring Helena and the disdaining Bertram, psychologically credible and even touching (2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico García Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Zinoman) 'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'GREY GARDENS' As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'HEDDA GABLER' In the title role of Ibsen's destructively dissatisfied heroine, Cate Blanchett is giving roughly a dozen of the liveliest performances to be seen this year, all at the same time, in the Sydney Theater Company's visiting production. A mere one or two at this level of intensity would have been enough. But she remains compellingly watchable in Robyn Nevin's hyped-up, spasmodic production (2:25). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger) 'INDOOR/OUTDOOR' A comedy by Kenny Finkle about a housecat torn between affection for her human companion and a sexy tomcat promising a tour of the great outdoors. Directed by Darren Goldstein and energetically performed by a cast of four, it's essentially just another dysfunctional relationship tale, with little kitty whiskers drawn on (1:50). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' A pair of interlocking monologues surrounding a little parody of an opera, with text by Wallace Shawn and music by his brother Allen. Written two decades ago and shelved when the authors failed to find a producer, this is a minor-key, underrealized work that hits a few elegiac notes but steps too gingerly around the psychosexual trauma at its core (1:45). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, the play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Honor Moore) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) * 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON' A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Moore) Off Off Broadway 'EL QUIJOTE' Sancho Panza is the real star of this often rollicking but uneven adaptation of Cervantes's ''Don Quijote.'' Caution: no windmills. In Spanish with simultaneous English translation (1:40). Repertorio Español, at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (George Hunka) 'THE TRAVELING LADY' A small but affecting production of Horton Foote's 1954 play, produced by Ensemble Studio Theater in association with Baylor University, where Marion Castleberry's staging originated. Like ''The Trip to Bountiful,'' of roughly the same vintage, this is a delicately drawn portrait of an anxious spirit in search of home, in this case a young wife looking to reunite with her ne'er-do-well husband (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ACTS OF MERCY: PASSION-PLAY' If there is a coherent story to Michael John Garcés' ''Acts of Mercy: passion-play,'' it is resolutely kept from the audience. As the efforts of two brothers to reconcile with a dying father progress, it seems possible that viewers are meant to discern the consequences of family trauma from punchy monosyllabic combat and repeated expletives, but their efforts to connect are continually frustrated (2:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, west of Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Moore) 'CLEAN ALTERNATIVES' Brian Dykstra's improbable comedy details the good fight fought by a businesswoman turned environmental activist taking on a toxin-spreading megacorporation. The play also depicts the moral transformation of a rapacious lawyer into a love-smitten puppy dog. Call it a fairy tale for our time (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street; closing Sunday. (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529; closing tomorrow. (Brantley) 'THE WOODEN BREEKS' The line dividing inspired whimsy from tedious nonsense can be a fine one, and much of this new play by Glen Berger falls on the wrong side of it. An elaborately conceived comedy seeking to celebrate the consolations of storytelling, it unfolds the tale of a Scottish tinker who dreams up imaginary worlds to keep despair at bay (2:00). MCC Theater, at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque, a k a the singer JoJo) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly.(Neil Genzlinger) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott) 'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott) 'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Manohla Dargis) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'LITTLE FISH' (R, 114 minutes) In this tough, savvy Australian film, Cate Blanchett sinks deeply into the role of a 32-year-old recovering heroin addict trying to rebuild her life and fighting the temptation to relapse. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoon-worthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World Tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE SHAGGY DOG' (PG, 98 minutes) Tim Allen is a prosecutor who is going, as it were, to the dogs in this revisiting of the old Disney film, which is far livelier than its namesake. Scenes in which Mr. Allen tries to fight off his inner canine while a no-nonsense judge played by Jane Curtin is holding a trial are comic gems.(Genzlinger) '16 BLOCKS' (PG-13, 105 minutes) If Richard Donner's presence suggests that his new action flick, ''16 Blocks,'' is a throwback to the 1980's, so does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally. Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. (Dargis) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist in the 1940's, arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the movie rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis) 'ULTRAVIOLET' (PG-13, 80 minutes) The latest in movies structured around eyewear and abdominals, ''Ultraviolet'' stars Milla Jovovich as a genetically modified human -- part vampire, part chameleon, all model -- and one of the many victims of a government experiment to improve on nature. Directed by Kurt Wimmer with a fine eye for the preferences of 12-year-old boys, ''Ultraviolet'' cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly.(Jeannette Catsoulis) 'Unknown White Male' (PG-13, 88 minutes) The British filmmaker Rupert Murray tells the bizarre story of his old friend Doug Bruce, who in 2003 walked into a Coney Island hospital claiming not to know who he was, thereupon becoming either a heart-wrenching casualty of a medical anomaly or the prime suspect in a mystery yet to be solved. (Dargis) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon (winner of the Academy Award for best actress), who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work continues this weekend with two silents directed by Richard Eichberg: ''Song'' (1928), in which Wong plays a dancer in love with a knife thrower, and ''The Pavement Butterfly,'' about a woman who runs away to the French Riviera after she is framed for murder. Both films will be accompanied by live music. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through Monday) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films, which has run five weeks this year, concludes on Monday with ''A Model for Matisse: The Story of the Vence Chapel'' (2005), about Henri Matisse's friendship and special project with a French Dominican nun. This weekend's films include ''The Tenth Planet: A Single Life in Baghdad'' (2004), about an Iraqi secretary's everyday life; ''Bachelor Farmer'' (2005), about gay men in small-town Idaho; and ''Les Petits Soldats'' (2004), about children who fought during civil unrest in Liberia. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) MAN IN THE DUNES: DISCOVERING HIROSHI TESHIGAHARA (Through March 19) BAMcinématek's tribute to Teshigahara (1927-2001), the artist, filmmaker and flower arranger, continues this weekend with ''Summer Soldiers'' (1972), a drama about two American soldiers who go AWOL while on leave in Tokyo, and ''The Face of Another'' (1966), a psychological thriller starring Tatsuya Nakadai as an accident victim who is given an artificial face. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) PRIX JEAN VIGO (Through Dec. 30) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with a series of 41 films from directors who have won the prize that bears his name. This weekend's feature is ''Qui Êtes-Vous, Polly Maggoo?'' (1965), William Klein's satire about the French fashion world, shown with ''Des Filles et des Chiens'' (1991), Sophie Fillières's short about adolescent friendship. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) RECENT FILMS FROM FINLAND (Through March 22) Scandinavia House continues its four-month program of Scandinavian films with a series of Finnish features. Anastasia Lapsui and Markku Lehmuskallio's ''Fata Morgana'' (2004), a documentary about the indigenous people of the Chukchi Peninsula, will be shown on Wednesday. 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates) SOME KIND OF HORROR SHOW (Through March 30) BAMcinématek's annual festival of horror movies continues on Monday and Tuesday with Kaneto Shindo's ''Kuroneko'' (1968), about the murderous spirits of two women killed by samurai in feudal Japan. On Thursday, ''Innocent Blood'' (1992), the adventures of a modern-day vampire who bites only bad people, will be shown, along with Michael Jackson's 13-minute ''Thriller'' video (1983). John Landis, who directed both, will hold a question-and-answer session afterward. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ALASH ENSEMBLE WITH KONGAR-OOL ONDAR (Monday) These Tuvan musicians stretch the definition of throat singing, the traditional, polyphonic technique, by adding some Western music elements. 9:30 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $12. (Laura Sinagra) THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND (Tonight, tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) The archetypal Southern rock band is still on the road. Gregg Allman, the band's keyboardist and main singer, is more than ever its center, since its co-founder Dickey Betts is estranged from the group. His replacement, Warren Haynes, shares the twin-guitar passages with Derek Trucks, the drummer Butch Trucks's nephew and a jam-band leader in his own right. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $49.99 to $84.99. (Jon Pareles) THE BATS (Sunday and Wednesday) Having just released its first album in a decade, this pastoral New Zealand guitar pop band continues to make the loose yet ornately pretty music that defined Kiwi-pop's 1980's heyday. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sinagra) JAMES BLUNT (Tuesday and Wednesday) With a Rod Stewart vocal tone that can also flip into transporting falsetto, this British artist writes songs in the ethereal but angsty Elliott Smith vein, only with more forceful alt-pop production. His song ''No Bravery'' is an antiwar lament that clings. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Both shows sold out.) (Sinagra) CRISTINA BRANCO (Tomorrow) The Portuguese songs called fado (fate) balance sorrowful melodies and lyrics about tragic destiny in a gleaming cat's cradle of finger-picked Portuguese guitars. It's music that frames a singer's voice while it mercilessly exposes every nuance of sorrow and determination. Cristina Branco is one of Portugal's most celebrated young fadistas. 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 992-8484; $32. (Pareles) ISOBEL CAMPBELL (Monday) This feather-voiced former member of Belle and Sebastian has made her own music as the Gentle Waves but also does so under her own name; she recently collaborated on some atmospheric music with Mark Lanegan of Screaming Trees. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $15. (Sinagra) THE CLOUD ROOM, FILM SCHOOL (Tomorrow) The new-wave-influenced naïf rockers the Cloud Room garnered wild, though deeply underground, buzz when their best song, ''Hey Hey Now,'' written during the frontman's grave illness, was given lots of wish-you-wells but never broke into larger indie-pop consciousness. The wistful rock band Film School also plays. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) DILATED PEOPLES, LITTLE BROTHER (Wednesday and Thursday) The straightforward rap of the Los Angeles group Dilated Peoples tries to offer a tough-guy corrective to gangsta bullying and shallow pop hip-hop. The result is short on fun. Little Brother's soul-grounded Carolina rap forgoes Southern crunk in favor of blending the free-form experimentation of Outkast with the kind of jazzy tracks that characterized East Coast hip-hop of the mid-1990's. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $25. (Sinagra) TOM DUNNE AND FRIENDS: A TRIBUTE TO PADDY CRONIN (Tonight) The Irish music traditionalist and multi-instrumentalist Tom Dunne pays tribute to the County Kerry fiddle legend Paddy Cronin. He is joined by the guitarist John Dillon and other musicians. 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950; $15; free to Ireland House members and N.Y.U. students. (Sinagra) EARLY MAN, PRIESTESS, THE SWORD (Tomorrow) The Ohio band Early Man is a heavy-metal duo that harks back to genre polestars like Judas Priest. Likewise, the Texans in the Sword do a great approximation of Black Sabbath's slow menace, at points also revealing hard-core punk underpinnings with intermittent thrash bravura. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, (201) 653-1703; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra) DEBORAH GIBSON (Tomorrow) Back in the 1980's she was Debbie Gibson, a teenage pop star correlate to Molly Ringwald, charming her way up the charts with hits like ''Shake Your Love'' and ''Lost in Your Eyes.'' Now she's a grown-up who does Broadway and hosts VH1 shows about, what else, teenage stars. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, SoHo, (212) 941-8100; $30. (Sinagra) HOT CHIP (Tomorrow) London's literate electro-poppers Hot Chip find room in their techno-savvy spectrum for wiseacre hat-tips to rap, R&B, indie rock and hip, wispy folk. 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sinagra) JANIS IAN (Tuesday) The singer-songwriter Janis Ian is still most famous for the folkie lament ''Society's Child'' and the ugly-duckling anthem ''At Seventeen,'' but the work of this rich-voiced musician is more varied than these, never shying away from the painful nuances of aging and loss, but always seeking redemption. Tuesday, she celebrates the release of her 20th major-label album, ''Folk Is the New Black.'' 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra) NISHAT KHAN (Tonight) The sitar player Nishat Khan comes from a long line of Indian virtuosos, including his father, Ustad Imrat Khan. The tabla player Abhijit Banerjee will join him in his performance of various ragas tonight. 8:30, Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 501-1390, (212) 247-7800; $30 and $42. (Sinagra) BETTYE LaVETTE, MARCIA BALL (Thursday) Bettye LaVette of Detroit released her first recording when she was 16, and soldiered on through a career that carried her through 15 labels, minor rhythm-and-blues hits like ''He Made a Woman Out of Me'' and years in Europe. But her tough, knowing voice and sense of drama could rival Tina Turner's. Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, knowing voice about all the trouble men and women can get into on the way to a good time. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $26.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) SONDRE LERCHE, PAUL BRILL (Tonight) Since making an indie cabaret-rock splash in 2002, the music of the Norwegian guitarist-crooner Sondre Lerche has suggested life experience beyond its confident purveyor's tender years. Lately he has taken a break from the baroque, applying his breathy yet urgent voice to a batch of lighthearted, stripped-down jazzy tunes. The local songwriter Paul Brill opens. 7:30, Housing Works Bookstore Café, 126 Crosby Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-3324; $25. (Sinagra) LES SAVY FAV (Tonight) The rockers Les Savvy Fav play revved-up punk with coiffed and stylish contours. 8, Warsaw at the Polish National Home, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 645-5156; $16.50. (Sinagra) LILYS (Tomorrow) This Philadelphia indie rock band is rendered consistently fascinating by the mercurial nature of its frontman (and only constant member), Kurt Heasley, who has exuded recalcitrant charisma as both an early-1990's shoe gazer and, later, an Anglophilic retro-rocker. 8 p.m., Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, near Henry Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069; $10. (Sinagra) SAMARA LUBELSKI, MI & L'AU (Tonight) Samara Lubelski, best known for her collaborations with the psychedelic outfits Hall of Fame and Tower Recordings, goes solo here. The Finnish singer Mi and the French musician L'au, after becoming a couple in Paris, moved to the woods in Finland to record what they will showcase here, a cache of austere, wintery bedroom folk. 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10. (Sinagra) MARAH (Tonight) This Philly-bred band has, in its decade-plus existence, pushed beyond scruffy alt-country into the realms of quirky bar rock and lo-fi 70's folk. 9, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12. (Sinagra) METRIC (Tonight) Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Hanes, this band finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Hanes's shuddering alto functions alternately as a weapon and a whip-cracking come-on. 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) THE POGUES (Thursday) Before every beer-brewing ethnicity spawned a punk band modernizing its traditionals with lashing, distorted guitar and aggressive, often hilarious howls, there was Ireland's Pogues. Its leader, Shane MacGowan, a man of tossed-off wit, ubiquitous slurring and few teeth, picked up in the 00's where he left off before the band's 90's hiatus. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $50. (Sinagra) QUEEN WITH PAUL ROdGERS (Sunday) Paul Rodgers, the swaggering lead singer of Free, Bad Company and the Firm, can't scale the falsetto highs of Queen's histrionic legend, Freddie Mercury, so he doesn't try. What results is a more democratized and meaty take on the band's worthy hits. 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000; $35 to $125. (Sinagra) Jane Siberry (Tomorrow) Jane Siberry is always trying another collaboration or another musical strategy. Her sweetly tousled voice, her sly intelligence, her determination to explore and her playful fascination with family, archetype and myth can all lead to intimate epiphanies. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 501-1390; $32 to $38. (Pareles) ALLEN TOUSSAINT: NEW ORLEANS BENEFIT BRUNCH (Sunday) The legendary New Orleans songwriter, producer and pianist Allen Toussaint, at one point rumored missing after Hurricane Katrina, performs for the benefit of continuing hurricane relief efforts in the Crescent City. Noon, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Avenue, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $30 for adults; $15 for children under 12. (Sinagra) JERRY JEFF WALKER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jerry Jeff Walker wrote the hit ''Mr. Bojangles,'' but around his home-stomping grounds of Texas, he's the easygoing, gruffly avuncular icon of the cosmic cowboy mentality, all about spacing out in the wide-open spaces. 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35 in advance, $40 at the door. (Pareles) WALTER (WOLFMAN) WASHINGTON (Wednesday) Mr. Washington, a New Orleans guitarist, has been a trusty funky collaborator for the likes of Bobby (Blue) Bland and Irma Thomas. His shows are usually rump-shaking affairs. 9 p.m., Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $17.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) * Barbara Cook (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) This Broadway legend is loose and down-home and, as always, magnificent singing a 25-year retrospective of songs she has performed at the Café Carlyle. 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100; dinner required at the 8:45 shows. (Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Tomorrow) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 7 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) Samantha Sidley (Tonight and tomorrow night) This budding 20-year-old winner of the Oak Room's young artist competition, accompanied by fellow students from the Berklee College of Music, is a charmingly sunny but still half-formed jazz interpreter. 9 and 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50, with a $50 prix fixe dinner at the early shows, or $20 minimum at the late shows. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. J. D. ALLEN (Wednesday) Mr. Allen is a probing tenor saxophonist, but he's not averse to digging into a groove; his rhythm section here includes the bassists Meshell Ndegeocello and Neal Caine and the drummer Gerald Cleaver. 10 p.m., Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $20. (Nate Chinen) RAN BLAKE/CHARLES GAYLE (Tonight) Mr. Blake is a pianist with an attraction to cinematic imagery and spooky silence; Mr. Gayle, better known as a fiery saxophonist, has his own rumbling touch at the keys. Each has a new solo piano album on Tompkins Square Records, and each plays in that format here. 8 (Mr. Blake and Mr. Gayle) and 10 (Mr. Gayle alone), the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) * CELEBRATING THE MAGIC OF TOOTS THIELEMANS (Thursday) Early in his 60-year career, the Belgian harmonica virtuoso Toots Thielemans invented an improvisational voice for his instrument. This tribute concert emphasizes the flexibility of his lyrical style, with a roster of special guests, including the saxophonists Joe Lovano and Paquito D'Rivera, the singers Al Jarreau and Ivan Lins, the guitarist Oscar Castro-Neves and the pianists Herbie Hancock, Eliane Elias and Kenny Werner. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $18 to $66. (Chinen) GERALD CLEAVER'S UNCLE JUNE (Wednesday) Dealing less in rhythm than in pulse, Mr. Cleaver's drumming perfectly suits the fluid requirements of jazz's post-everything avant-garde; this ruminative project features the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the violinist Mat Maneri, the keyboardist Craig Taborn and the bassist Drew Gress. 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) SHANE ENDSLEY GROUP (Thursday) Mr. Endsley, a progressive-minded but lyrical trumpeter, pursues a floating pop sensibility in this ensemble, with Matt Moran on vibraphone, Erik Deutsch on keyboards and Todd Sickafoose on bass, among others. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8.

(Chinen) BEN GERSTEIN COLLECTIVE (Monday) The trombonist Ben Gerstein has led this free-improvising ensemble since 2000, enlisting some of the brightest young inside-outside players in the city; here the group consists of seven pieces, including the saxophonist David Binney, the trombonist Jacob Garchik and the keyboardist Jacob Sacks. 7 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; no cover. (Chinen) ROY HARGROVE QUINTET + 1 (Tuesday through March 19) Mr. Hargrove, a sharp and energetic trumpeter, has led this hard-bop combo for years; as on a forthcoming album, ''Nothing Serious'' (Verve), its ranks are augmented here by the veteran trombonist Slide Hampton. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables and a $5 minimum, or $20 at the bar with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) * ROY HAYNES QUARTET (Tuesday through March 19) Now in his 80's, Mr. Haynes is irrefutably an elder statesman, but his drumming, like his sartorial sense, evinces a boldly contemporary swagger. He has lost nothing, it seems, to the years; what he has gained is unmatched experience and a legend commensurate with his talent. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) JACOB FRED JAZZ ODYSSEY (Tonight and tomorrow) This groove-minded piano trio put out a spacey but solid album, ''The Sameness of Difference'' (Hyena), last year; they boost their considerable jam-band appeal here with a pair of guests, the percussionist Mike Dillon and the saxophonist known as Skerik. 12:30 a.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $15, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) JUILLIARD JAZZ QUINTET (Tuesday through March 19) Commemorating a century of music education at Juilliard, this ensemble is led by the tenor saxophonist Victor Goines and the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon, conductors of the five-year-old Juilliard Jazz Orchestra; the pianist Ted Rosenthal, the bassist Ben Wolfe and the drummer Carl Allen make up the rhythm section. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) DAVE LIEBMAN'S DIFFERENT BUT THE SAME (Tonight) An incantatory saxophonist working in the post-Coltrane idiom, Mr. Liebman digs in with several fellow adventurers: the saxophonist Ellery Eskelin, the bassist Tony Marino and the drummer Nasheet Waits. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $15, including two drinks. (Chinen) JOE LOVANO QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Lovano has become one of the stalwart saxophonists in modern jazz, equally inspired by John Coltrane's harmonic inquiry, Ornette Coleman's off-kilter lyricism and Ben Webster's heart-rending croon; this band, his newest, includes James Weidman on piano, Esperanza Spalding on bass and Francisco Mela on drums. 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) ORCHESTRA SLANG (Monday through March 18) This ensemble has as many pieces as a conventional big band, but looks well beyond big-band conventions (or any others). Its chief architects are the drummer Kenny Wollesen, the trumpeter Jonathan Haffner and, in the role of philosophical guide, the conductor and cornetist Lawrence (Butch) Morris. 7 and 9 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, near North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934; no cover. (Chinen) MARIO PAVONE'S ORANGE BAND (Thursday) Mr. Pavone, a bassist-composer with an expansive worldview, leads a cadre of fellow colorists: Ron Horton on trumpet, Tony Malaby on saxophones, David Berkman on piano and Gerald Cleaver on drums. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen) PHILADELPHIA: CITY OF BROTHERLY JAZZ (Tonight and tomorrow night) Continuing its salute to American jazz cities, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra looks to the vibrant legacy of Philadelphia. Special guests include the saxophonist Jimmy Heath and his brother, the drummer Albert (Tootie) Heath; the post-bop guitar hero Pat Martino; the Hammond B-3 organ whiz Joey DeFrancesco; and the trumpeter Duane Eubanks. 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, www.jalc.org; $105.50 and $135.50.(Chinen) CHRIS POTTER'S UNDERGROUND (Through Sunday) The saxophonist Chris Potter has an improvisational approach that is intellectual and athletic in equal measure; his band Underground dives headlong into edgy fusion, with Adam Rogers on guitar, Craig Taborn on Fender Rhodes piano and Nate Smith on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20 and $25. (Chinen) TO PREZ WITH LOVE, 2006 (Sunday) The Lester Young Memorial Celebration, an annual benefit for the Jazz Ministry at St. Peter's Church, is a sprawling affair by design; this edition, the 22nd, boasts a lineup of several dozen musicians and advocates, like the pianists Billy Taylor and Hank Jones, the clarinetist Don Byron and the historian and radio personality Phil Schaap. 7 p.m., St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 935-2200; suggested donation, $15. (Chinen) MARCUS PRINTUP (Tonight) Mr. Printup's trumpet style has more than a little in common with that of Wynton Marsalis, his bandleader in the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra; out on his own, he goes for flashier, more avowedly modern exertions. 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $15. (Chinen) MARC RIBOT AND HENRY GRIMES (Thursday) Mr. Ribot is a vagabond poet on solo electric guitar, as he proved with the album ''Saints'' (Atlantic) five years ago. Here he plays both solo and in a duo with Mr. Grimes, a bassist and long-lost titan of the avant-garde; there's no knowing which setting will sound better. 8 p.m., Issue Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org; cover, $10. (Chinen) EDWARD SIMON'S VENEZUELAN PROJECT (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Simon, a pianist whose most recent credits include work with the Brazilian singer Luciana Souza, turns his focus here toward the country of his birth. His serious sextet consists of the saxophonist Mark Turner, the flutist Marco Granados, the cuatro and guitar player Aquiles Báez, the bassist John Patitucci and the drummer Adam Cruz. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25.(Chinen) * BOBO STENSON TRIO (Wednesday through March 18) With ''Goodbye'' (ECM), the Swedish pianist Bobo Stenson offered one of last year's most beautifully somber piano trio recordings. Here he plays his only live performances with the same personnel from the album: his longtime bassist Anders Jormin, a fellow Swede, and the august and inscrutable New York drummer Paul Motian. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) YOSVANY TERRY GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Terry, a saxophonist and percussionist, chases contemporary post-bop ideals without fighting the rhythmic pull of his native Cuba; this seven-piece ensemble is only slightly smaller than the one on his excellent new album, ''Metamorphosis'' (Kindred Rhythm), and no less fierce. 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15. (Chinen) THE TUBA PROJECT (Tomorrow) Though the name may suggest otherwise, there's only one tuba player in this ensemble; given that it's Bob Stewart, the instrument's greatest improviser, one should be enough. As on the new album ''The Tuba Project'' (CIMP), he's joined by the pianist Lucian Ban, the baritone saxophonist Alex Harding, the tenor saxophonist J. D. Allen and the drummer Derrek Phillips. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) DAVID WEISS (Tonight and tomorrow; Wednesday) This weekend, Mr. Weiss, a literate and industrious trumpeter, leads his post-bop quintet; on Wednesday, he assembles Endangered Species, a 12-piece ensemble stocked with serious talent and dedicated to the music of Wayne Shorter. Tonight and tomorrow at 12:30 a.m. , Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $10, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. Wednesday at 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) The Amato Opera's reputation is that it conveys the spirit and love of Italian opera, though the full impact is impossible to achieve in a 102-seat theater with a cast that changes at every performance. And against the odds, all the principals at a recent performance of ''Aida'' managed to make it through to the end, demonstrating a true love of the piece, if not always of the pitch. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) 'LA BOHÈME' (Sunday and Thursday) City Opera has a refreshing take on Puccini's perennial classic, updating it to the eve of World War I and presenting some of its regulars, including Kelly Kaduce and Shannah Timms. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 tickets remaining on Sunday; $16 to $120 on Thursday. (Midgette) 'DARKLING' (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) In an adventurous move, American Opera Projects is presenting a brave and sensitive, if at times frustrating, multimedia work. With a score by Stefan Weisman, ''Darkling'' is an ''operatic fantasia on themes of emotional fragmentation,'' in the words of the director Michael Comlish, who conceived the idea of adapting for the stage Anna Rabinowitz's book-length poem about a restless Polish couple who marry hastily before the invasion of the Nazis. 8 p.m., East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $45. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) It's tempting to say that ''Forza'' has the most numbingly witless libretto of any Verdi opera, but with such stiff competition, who can say? Giancarlo del Monaco's drab staging, first seen in 1996, offers little help, but the Met has a solid first cast, with Deborah Voigt as Leonora, Salvatore Licitra as Don Alvaro and Mark Delavan as Don Carlo. On Wednesday, Elena Zelenskaya replaces Ms. Voigt, and Mark Rucker takes over for Mr. Delavan. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Wednesday. (Allan Kozinn) 'LUISA MILLER' (Monday) None of Verdi's Schiller operas are very Schiller-like; this one becomes melodrama in the silent-movie sense, with the miller's beautiful daughter, an evil henchman and thwarted love. The Met's casting doesn't preserve much of the fresh-faced innocence of the story, but offers established singers: Veronica Villarroel as Luisa, and Neil Shicoff as Rodolfo. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Midgette) 'MAZEPPA' (Tonight and Tuesday) Tchaikovsky's epic 1884 opera, about the ruthless 17th-century Ukrainian separatist Ivan Mazeppa, is an anguished, probing and noble work. The Met deserves thanks for presenting its first production of this inexplicably neglected masterpiece, inspiringly conducted by Valery Gergiev. A cast of mostly Russian singers brings conviction and palpable authority, especially the baritone Nikolai Putilin as the wizened Mazeppa, and the soprano Olga Guryakova as his adolescent and impressionable wife. The musical performance is so compelling that you can almost ignore Yuri Alexandrov's jumbled and trashy production, which clutters the opera with symbolism. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205. (Tommasini) 'THE MOST HAPPY FELLA' (Tonight and tomorrow) Frank Loesser thought of his 1956 masterpiece as a ''musical with a lot of music,'' not as an opera. Still, this sophisticated and disarming musical is a good fit for the New York City Opera, which has opened its spring season with a vibrant and charming production by Philip Wm. McKinley. Paul Sorvino, making his City Opera debut, inhabits the title role of Tony Esposito, the paunchy, insecure but good-hearted Italian immigrant vineyard owner in the Napa Valley of the 1920's. His voice, though, is pretty raw and shaky. He's at his best when he doesn't care about how he sounds and just lets go. The rest of the cast, mostly from the musical theater world, is wonderful. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 1:30 and 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 to $120. (Tommasini) Classical Music KATE ALDRICH (Monday) Tapping exciting young singers is a tradition the Opera Orchestra of New York hopes to continue. This one is a strong young mezzo-soprano who has already appeared with the group, offering a recital of Berlioz, Britten, Chausson, Dvorak, Mozart and Strauss. 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35. (Midgette) ATLANTA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) Between Lincoln Center's Golijov festival and his recent appearances leading the New York Philharmonic, Robert Spano seems to be spending nearly as much time in New York as with his own orchestra in Atlanta. He gets to have it both ways tomorrow, when he leads the Atlanta Symphony and its chorus in the Verdi Requiem. The vocal soloists are Andrea Gruber, Stephanie Blythe, Frank Lopardo and Greer Grimsley. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $23 to $79. (Kozinn) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Tonight, the Waterville Trio plays music by Rachmaninoff, Chopin and Lachert. Tomorrow and Sunday, the veteran cellist Colin Carr is joined by the pianist Thomas Sauer for a recital of works by Prokofiev, Beethoven and Chopin. Thursday, the versatile folk-jazz-classical fiddler Mark O'Connor brings his Edgeffect Ensemble (a piano trio) for its first New York performance, featuring his own compositions. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m.; Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Eichler) JONATHAN BISS AND THE MENDELSSOHN STRING QUARTET (Tonight) The Mendelssohn Quartet opens with the Andante and Scherzo (Op. 81) by its namesake and also plays Beethoven's ''Harp'' in E flat. The superb pianist Jonathan Biss -- whose mother, Miriam Fried, is one of the Mendelssohn players -- joins for the Dvorak A major Piano Quintet. 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Kozinn) JESSE BLUMBERG (Sunday) The Marilyn Horne Foundation, in its continuing effort to keep the tradition of the song recital flourishing, presents young singers in a monthly series of informal recitals. Mr. Blumberg, a New Jersey-born baritone who recently appeared as Papageno with the Milwaukee Opera Theater, will sing a varied program with the pianist Martin Katz. 3 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue and 50th Street, (212) 378-0248; $20; $15 for 65+; free to students. (Tommasini) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Wednesday) The Orion String Quartet performs Mendelssohn's Quartet No. 6 and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's Quartet No. 2. But the most ear-opening score on the program may be the String Sextet of Erwin Schulhoff, a German-speaking Czech Jew and victim of Nazism, whose fantastically eclectic body of work includes a Dadaist ''Sonata Erotica'' and a cantata setting of ''The Communist Manifesto.'' 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $30 to $52. (Eichler) VLADIMIR FELTSMAN (Tomorrow) The Peoples' Symphony Concerts are a great deal if you're looking to hear big-name performers without breaking the bank. This weekend, the formidable pianist Vladimir Feltsman plays works by Haydn, Beethoven and Schumann. 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, 16th Street and Irving Place, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9 (Eichler). JERUSALEM SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Leon Botstein brings his new out-of-town orchestra to Carnegie Hall. Martinu's ''Memorial to Lidice'' will be the item of interest, along with music by Prokofiev and Strauss. 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $20 to $80. (Bernard Holland) OLGA KERN (Thursday) This dynamic young Russian pianist, who shared a gold at the Van Cliburn Competition in 2001, plays Mendelssohn, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Liszt. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $20 to $50. (Eichler) KIROV ORCHESTRA (Sunday and Monday) To mark the Shostakovich centenary, Lincoln Center has invited Valery Gergiev to lead all 15 symphonies -- no, not in one stretch, though you wouldn't put it past Mr. Gergiev to try. The conductor will split his survey between his two ensembles: the Kirov Orchestra, here this week, and the Rotterdam Philharmonic, arriving next month. Sunday's program features the Symphonies Nos. 1, 2 and 10; Monday brings Nos. 7 and 9. Sunday at 3 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69. (Eichler) MARGARET LATTIMORE, STEPHANIE NOVACEK, MARY PHILLIPS, JAKE HEGGIE, RICKY IAN GORDON and EUGENIA ZUCKERMAN (Tuesday) The idea is simpler than the long roster of names would suggest: music by Mr. Gordon and Mr. Heggie, accompanied by the composers on the piano and by a flute, sung by three mezzo-sopranos, with just a soupçon of Ned Rorem and Stephen Sondheim. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $32. (Midgette) ALEXANDER LONQUICH (Wednesday) Though widely respected in Europe, this 45-year-old German-born pianist, now living in Italy, is not well known in the United States. For this, his American recital debut, he plays the New York premiere of Wolfgang Rihm's ''Tombeau'' and works by Mozart, Schumann, Chopin and C. P. E. Bach. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Tommasini) JEANNE MALLOW (Tomorrow) Though this violist comes from a distinguished family of string players (including her grandmother, the violist Lillian Fuchs, and her great-uncle, the violinist Joseph Fuchs), she has built her career on her own, with notable performances and recordings. For this program she will play works by Vivaldi, Schumann, Rachmaninoff and William Keith Rogers, with the pianist Vladimir Valjarevic. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Tommasini) SOHEIL NASSERI (Tomorrow) This young Californian pianist has both a magnificent technique and an inventive interpretive spirit, qualities that served him well in the early installments of his two-season Beethoven cycle. Mr. Nasseri has chosen not to present the sonatas in chronological order, so his concluding program actually leaves him among relatively early works: Nos. 8 (the ''Pathétique'') through 11, and 16. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $33 and $45. (Kozinn) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) After canceling last week because of bad health, Christoph von Dohnanyi plans to return to conduct a program that includes Bartok's ''Bluebeard's Castle'' with Anne Sofie von Otter and Matthias Goerne. 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94. (Holland) ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Monday) Bach has been a good venture for this conductorless group, which has been joined this year by the conductorless Bach Choir and started a series of Bach cantatas with members of the choir in the appropriate setting of the Metropolitan Museum's Medieval Sculpture Hall. On the program: Cantatas 18, 157, and 193. 8 p.m., the Metropolitan Museum, (212) 570-3949; $60. (Midgette) CHARLES ROSEN (Sunday) Mr. Rosen is as renowned for his insightful books and essays as for his probing piano performances, but his playing is by no means bookish: as concerned as he is with the details of style and structure, he is also intent on showing composers as animated by passions and desires, and working within a historical context that includes influences and competitors. Mr. Rosen will explore the influence of Bach and Haydn on Mozart in a program that includes selections from Bach's ''Art of Fugue'' and ''Musical Offering,'' as well as Haydn's Sonata No. 43 and Divertimento in F, and Mozart's Gigue in G and Sonata in A minor. 1:30 p.m. (lecture) and 3 p.m. (recital), 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Kozinn) NADJA SALERNO-SONNENBERG (Tuesday) It is the season of Brahms violin sonatas: Less than a month after Christian Tetzlaff played all three in Alice Tully Hall, Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg tackles the same program on the same stage. Given their radically different performance styles, the overlaps should end there. The pianist Anne-Marie McDermott joins. 8 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Eichler) JORDI SAVALL AND HESPÈRION XXI (Wednesday and Thursday) A fantastic performer on the viola da gamba and also one of the early-music world's most inventive ensemble leaders, Mr. Savall presides over what promises to be an illuminating master class on Wednesday. The next night, he leads in his flagship ensemble, Hespèrion XXI, in variations by Diego Ortiz, Lucas Ruiz de Ribayaz, José Marín, Juan Hidalgo, Gaspar Sanz and Antonio Martín. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $25 on Wednesday, in Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium; $60 on Thursday, in the Medieval Sculpture Hall (sold out); $25 for a preconcert discussion on Thursday at 6 p.m. with Mr. Savall and David D'Arcy, in the Rogers Auditorium. (Kozinn) JEAN-YVES THIBAUDET (Wednesday) In the hearts of the French, Ravel and Schumann are kindred spirits. Mr. Thibaudet here plays piano music by both. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $72. (Holland) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

(Anderson) * YVONNE MEIER (Thursday) Ms. Meier is returning after eight years to her enjoyably anarchic improvisational choreography. For her new pieces ''this is not a pink pony'' and ''Gogolorez,'' she has enlisted the aid of downtown-dance stars like Miguel Gutierrez, Jennifer Monson, Nami Yamamoto and Jeremy Wade. (Through March 18.) 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 14, www.thekitchen.org; $12. (Dunning) * BENJAMIN MILLEPIED & COMPANY (Tuesday through Thursday) One of the smartest and liveliest of New York City Ballet dancers, Mr. Millepied will lead his company, whose roster includes several bright young City Ballet performers and the American Ballet Theater star Gillian Murphy, in a new work by Aszure Barton and in three new dances of his own. They are set to scores that include piano music by Philip Glass, played by Pedja Muzijevic, and accompaniment cued by the dancers' motions. (Through March 19.)

(John Rockwell) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Sunday) An annual event concludes with the Francesca Harper Project in ''Modo Fusion,'' a multimedia work that Ms. Harper, a dancer, singer and choreographer, conceived in collaboration with Brian Reeder, a former dancer with American Ballet Theater.

(Dunning) * STAN WON'T DANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) The United States debut of this promising-looking troupe, led by two former dancers of the DV8 Physical Theater in London. Their piece ''Sinner'' is, according to a news release, ''designed to shatter the limits of physical and emotional endurance.'' (Through March 18.) 8 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288, www.ps122.org; $20; members, $10. (Rockwell) SUMMERFEST '06: ANDREA HAENGGI/AMDAT (Tonight and tomorrow night) With the aid of dance and video, Andrea Haenggi's ''escalator'' transforms lobbies and moving stairways into four magical theaters, each evoking a mood of its own. 7 and 8:30, World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505 or www.worldfinancialcenter.com; free.

(Rockwell) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. Her works do not lend themselves to easy deciphering, but her magic with materials and her daring compositional imagination draw you in. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.)(Nicolai Ouroussoff) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith) P.S. 1: Jessica Stockholder: 'Of Standing Float Roots in Thin Air,' through May 1. A soaring, cannily designed installation -- made of airborne plastic bins, electric lights, orange extension cords and an old armchair topping a wooden tower -- by a sculptor known for orchestrating productive collisions of formalism and consumerism. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Ken Johnson) P.S. 1: 'Ricky Swallow,' through March 20. Extraordinarily realistic and symbolically portentous sculptures carved from wood by Australia's representative to last summer's Venice Biennale, in which three of the five works on view here were included. (See above.) (Johnson) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'LANDSCAPE,' through Sept. 18. With only 20 works dispersed throughout the Whitney's second floor, this startlingly fresh installation of recent art from the museum's collection uses space in an extravagant, exhilarating way, while weaving a cat's cradle of intersecting meanings, emotions, forms and processes through the landscapes of American art and history. It turns out that the less you look at, the more you can see, especially in an arrangement orchestrated by someone who believes that the best tool for coaxing out an artwork's polymorphous content is another piece of art. This someone is Donna De Salvo, the museum's new associate director for programs and curator of collections; her Whitney debut should be seen by anyone interested in the craft and art of a curator. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. Beauty is hard to come by. Check out, among other things, Paul Chan's digital animation of shadowy objects like cellphones and bicycles, floating upward, Wizard of Oz-like, while bodies tumble down, the work cast as if it were light from a tall window slanting onto the floor of a dark room. And also Pierre Huyghe's film, shot in Antarctica and Central Park. It's really gorgeous: crosscut between day and night, fiction and reality, it encapsulates the show's operative but ultimately airy metaphor about the slippery state of art now. (''Day for Night'' is the biennial's first-ever title, after the François Truffaut film.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown Tony Cragg: 'Five Bottles' In the early 1980's, this eminent English sculptor made flat, mosaiclike works out of found colored plastic objects and fragments. This show presents a set of five wall-works, each representing a different giant colored bottle composed of toys, combs, cigarette lighters and other pieces of ordinary commercial detritus. Vivian Horan, 35 East 67th Street, (212) 517-9410, through April 21. (Johnson) Jim Shaw: 'My Mirage 1986- 91' This amazingly inventive California-based artist first became widely known for a series of about 170 works, all measuring 17 by 14 inches, that chronicles the life of a white suburban boy named Billy, from innocent youth to druggy degradation to born-again salvation. The 30 pieces from the series in this show variously imitate comic strips, acid-rock posters, thrift store paintings, comic greeting cards and many other pop culture forms. Skarstedt, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 737-2060, through April 1. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea 'MetLife' The curator and publisher Geoffrey Young has organized an enthralling show of small works by 12 artists who favor exacting craftsmanship and surrealistic imagination. Some, like Oona Ratcliffe, Cary Smith and Patricia Fabricant, tend toward abstraction; others, like Chris Zitelli and Morgan Bulkeley, create dreamlike narrative and symbolic images. Morgan Lehman, 317 10th Avenue, near 28th Street, (212) 268-6699, through April 1. (Johnson) * William Nicholson Though less well-known than his son, the British abstract painter Ben Nicholson, Sir William Nicholson was a successful artist in his day. The mostly small landscapes, portraits and Chardinesque still lifes in this beautiful show offer transporting fusions of paint and imagery. Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, through March 25. (Johnson) Other Galleries * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) THE STUDIO VISIT The studio visit, a time-honored ritual that everyone in the art world has both endured and learned from, is taken to its limit in Exit Art's latest exhibition marathon. Each of the 160 mostly short videos represents one artist's idea of, play on, or substitute for, a studio visit. It is a show that often cries out for a fast-forward button, but there are some notable gems -- for example, by Joyce Pensato, Cynthia von Buhler, Ida Applebroog, Bruce Pearson, Lance Wakeling, Taylor McKimens, Paul Wirhun, Elisabeth Kley, Christy Gast and Kim Jones. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 966-7745, through March 25. (Smith) 'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson) Last Chance Stan Brodsky 'Evidence of Things' At 80, this painter, based in Huntington, N.Y., is making abstractions of uncommon liveliness and material richness. With their craggy, calligraphic forms glowing and flickering against fields of lush, generously applied color, Mr. Brodsky's paintings evoke the idea of an Abstract Expressionist who traded in his angst for hedonistic jouissance. June Kelly, 591 Broadway, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 226-1660; closes Tuesday. (Johnson) * DAVID DUPUIS/JESSICA JACKSON HUTCHINS In complementary shows, Mr. Dupuis cultivates his Surrealist-Symbolist penchant for small, visionary landscapes, while branching out into grotesquely detailed self-portraits, and Ms. Hutchins offers macabre spoofs of ceramics, social rituals and craftsmanship, with crudely made tea bowls and serving platters perched on topographically suggestive pedestals. Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-6411; through tomorrow. (Smith) * RICHARD GREAVES: ANARCHITECTURE; MARIO DEL CURTO: PHOTOGRAPHS Mr. del Curto's sympathetic black-and-white photographs introduce Mr. Greaves's bristling huts and environments, built during the last decade in the wilds of Canada. Materials include parts of salvaged barns and farm houses joined with baling wire into sagging, swaying, psychologically potent forms that qualify as outsider architecture, site-specific installation art and settings for fairy tales -- especially those about witches. Andrew Edlin Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9723; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * DAINA HIGGINS In an art world knee-deep in feats of realism, these small paintings of urban scenes stand out. They are made with spray paint and stencils, based on photographs taken by the artist, a technique that gives the gritty subjects a transcendental immateriality, as if the world were made of varying tones of light. Elizabeth Harris Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-9666; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Jerry Kearns: 'Forever More' For many years Mr. Kearns has been making illustrative paintings combining Pop-Surrealist style, leftist politics and anti-consumerist social commentary, with humor and obviousness often battling to a draw. His new paintings feature muscle-bound Jesus figures, hysterical hermaphrodites, creepy children, magical birds, fast-food products and heavenly blue skies. Michael Steinberg, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-5770; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500; closes Sunday.

Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RING OF FIRE' The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico García Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CHRISTINE JORGENSON REVEALS' Bradford Louryk meticulously lip-syncs a fascinating hourlong interview about gender and sexuality with Ms. Jorgenson, whose sex change operation in the 1950's was big news (1:00). The Studio Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Zinoman) 'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'FAMILY SECRETS' Performing old jokes with meticulous detail, Sherry Glaser in her solo show brings to life three generations of a Jewish family (1:30). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737.(George Hunka) 'GREY GARDENS' As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'HEDDA GABLER' In the title role of Ibsen's destructively dissatisfied heroine, Cate Blanchett is giving roughly a dozen of the liveliest performances to be seen this year, all at the same time, in the Sydney Theater Company's visiting production. A mere one or two at this level of intensity would have been enough. But she remains compellingly watchable in Robyn Nevin's hyped-up, spasmodic production (2:25). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' A solid revival of one of Shakespeare's problem plays in which the director Beatrice Terry has opted to emphasize the humor, especially in the scenes of comic relief. A staging with handsome costumes and that for the most part boasts a fine cast, whose members have made some smart choices (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Wilborn Hampton) 'MEASURE FOR PLEASURE' A mock-Restoration comedy by David Grimm. Seeking to do a little restoration work of his own, he inserts great chunks of fresh dirt into every nook, cranny and convention of an old form. Acted to the hilt by a first-rate company under the direction of Peter DuBois, this tirelessly ribald comedy will tickle, offend or simply bore in measures that will vary according to your taste for blatantly vulgar sexual comedy (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' A pair of interlocking monologues surrounding a little parody of an opera, with text by Wallace Shawn and music by his brother Allen. Written two decades ago and shelved when the authors failed to find a producer, this is a minor-key, underrealized work that hits a few elegiac notes but steps too gingerly around the psychosexual trauma at its core (1:45). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Honor Moore) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) * 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON' A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Moore) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'BLUFF' Jeffrey Sweet's mostly comic tale of a young New York couple whose tentative romance is disrupted by a boorish stepfather has great fun playing with the audience through direct address and such, but it is executed with too much smirking (1:25). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'EL QUIJOTE' Sancho Panza is the real star of this often rollicking but uneven adaptation of Cervantes's ''Don Quijote.'' Caution: no windmills. In Spanish with simultaneous English translation (1:40). Repertorio Español, at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. ( Hunka) * 'FAT BOY' John Clancy's knockabout satire is blessed by a roaring performance by Del Pentecost as the round, murdering title character (1:30). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo, (212) 868-4444. ( Zinoman). 'SAVAGES' Lurking somewhere in this stiff new play by Anne Nelson is a compelling op-ed piece yearning to be set free. Examining a little-known episode from the Philippines-American war at the turn of the last century, the author of the popular play ''The Guys'' argues that the United States involvement in Iraq echoes that previous mess. Unfortunately, the play has too much information to impart to allow time for nuanced drama to emerge (1:30). Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) '33 TO NOTHING' A band break up while playing break-up music in Grant James Varjas's comic, sometimes poignant play. Music performed by the actors. Argo Theater Company, at the Bottle Factory Theater, 195 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gwen Orel) 'WE USED TO GO OUT' Jason Mantzoukas and Jessica St. Clair revive the tradition of male-female comedy team in this appealing sketch about a disintegrating romance (1:00). UCB Theater, 306 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9176). ( Zinoman) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance * 'ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL' This Theater for a New Audience production inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production in which there is nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role. Darko Tresnjak and his cast find a way to make the play's troubled romance, between the adoring Helena and the disdaining Bertram, psychologically credible and even touching (2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'INDOOR/OUTDOOR' A comedy by Kenny Finkle about a housecat torn between affection for her human companion and a sexy tomcat promising a tour of the great outdoors. Directed by Darren Goldstein and energetically performed by a cast of four, it's essentially just another dysfunctional relationship tale, with little kitty whiskers drawn on (1:50). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE LAST NIGHT OF SALOME' More an acting exercise than a play, this Italian import is a showcase for the body language and physical comedy of a teacher of movement theater, Lydia Biondi, who portrays an unhappy middle-aged bar owner in 1950's Rome who meets and briefly bonds with a famous actress played by Carla Cassola. In Italian with English supertitles (1:05). LaMaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closing Sunday.(Andrea Stevens) 'OFFSPRING' Jimmy Barden's play about a rich white woman consorting with a young black radical recalls Tom Wolfe's cynical take on Leonard Bernstein's 1970 party for the Black Panthers. The comic moments don't, alas, redeem the characters' tired and tiresome politics (2:00). Presented by the Negro Ensemble Company, at the 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday.(Miriam Horn) 'PARADISE LOST, THE MUSICAL' This earnest -- probably too earnest -- musical take on Milton's epic shows off some good voices in the young cast of 20, but there's something purgatorial about it (2:00). The Producer's Club II, 616 Ninth Avenue, between 43rd and 44th Streets, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. ( Genzlinger) 'THE TRAVELING LADY' A small but affecting production of Horton Foote's 1954 play, produced by Ensemble Studio Theater in association with Baylor University, where Marion Castleberry's staging originated. Like ''The Trip to Bountiful,'' of roughly the same vintage, this is a delicately drawn portrait of an anxious spirit in search of home, in this case a young wife looking to reunite with her ne'er-do-well husband (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque, a k a the singer JoJo) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly.(Neil Genzlinger) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott) 'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott) 'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Manohla Dargis) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE SHAGGY DOG' (PG, 98 minutes) Tim Allen is a prosecutor who is going, as it were, to the dogs in this revisiting of the old Disney film, which is far livelier than its namesake. Scenes in which Mr. Allen tries to fight off his inner canine while a no-nonsense judge played by Jane Curtin is holding a trial are comic gems.(Genzlinger) '16 BLOCKS' (PG-13, 105 minutes) If Richard Donner's presence suggests that his new action flick, ''16 Blocks,'' is a throwback to the 1980's, so does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally. Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. (Dargis) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist in the 1940's, arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the movie rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis) 'ULTRAVIOLET' (PG-13, 80 minutes) The latest in movies structured around eyewear and abdominals, ''Ultraviolet'' stars Milla Jovovich as a genetically modified human -- part vampire, part chameleon, all model -- and one of the many victims of a government experiment to improve on nature. Directed by Kurt Wimmer with a fine eye for the preferences of 12-year-old boys, ''Ultraviolet'' cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon (winner of the Academy Award for best actress), who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work continues this weekend with ''The Thief of Bagdad'' (1924), the movie that made her career (she plays a double-crossing slave opposite Douglas Fairbanks Sr.); ''Chu Chin Chow'' (1934), a retelling of the story of Ali Baba and the 40 thieves; and ''A Study in Scarlet'' (1933), a Sherlock Holmes mystery in which Wong plays a very suspicious widow. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates) CANADIAN FRONT 2006 (Through Monday) The Museum of Modern Art's annual exhibition of recent films from Canada includes Amnon Buchbinder's ''Whole New Thing'' (2005), a coming-of-age story about an adolescent writer who develops an attachment to his gay English teacher; Carl Bessai's ''Unnatural and Accidental'' (2006), a drama about a serial killer of aboriginal women; and Allan King's ''Memory for Max, Claire, Ida and Company'' (2005), a documentary set at a Jewish home for the elderly in Toronto. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) DON SIEGEL (Through April 13) Siegel, who died in 1991, was a master of several genres, including science fiction, westerns and police thrillers. Film Forum's four-week, 25-movie retrospective of his work begins today with ''Charley Varrick'' (1973), starring Walter Matthau as a small-time crook whose bank heist appears to be too successful.

(Gates) MAN IN THE DUNES: DISCOVERING HIROSHI TESHIGAHARA (Through Sunday) BAMcinématek's tribute to Teshigahara (1927-2001), the artist, filmmaker and flower arranger, concludes this weekend with ''Woman in the Dunes'' (1964), his masterpiece drama about an entomologist trapped in the desert. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ANIMAL COLLECTIVE (Thursday) These moody junkyard folk-poppers find a kind of romance in wails and clatter. Their cracked progressive-rock jams and urban pastoral chant-alongs map a landscape where fantastical beasts gather for ritual rocking around trashcan campfires. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sold out.) (Laura Sinagra) ANNIE (Monday) This Norwegian singer's happy dance pop takes on darker aspects as a result of her associations with the minimalist techno club scene and work with bands like the glitchy Royksopp and the art-poppy St. Etienne. 7 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra) THE ARK, PRINCESS SUPERSTAR (Thursday) The Swedish band the Ark plays fast and loose with glam regalia, trafficking in party music with titles like ''Let Your Body Decide.'' The cheeky trash-rapper Princess Superstar's raps about the joys of juvenile delinquency, like ''Bad Babysitter,'' have gained her a reputation as the female Eminem. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13. (Sinagra) BLACK 47 (Tonight) Black 47 represents Irish rock, New York style, where memories of jigs and reels and Irish history run into immigrant tales, politics and hip-hop. 6:30 and 10, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Jon Pareles) SIR RICHARD BISHOP (Wednesday) As part of the long-running trio of Bay Area jazz, folk and rock collagists Sun City Girls, the guitarist Sir Richard Bishop has had a sympathetic outlet for his brand of sonic expression -- which can veer from Middle Eastern modes to jazzy vamps to John Fahey-like rambles. He plays solo here. 8 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484; $8. (Sinagra) CHRIS BROWN (Tonight) Riding rough beats with a childlike sweetness on the single ''Run It,'' the teenage R & B singer Chris Brown snags both the adult hip-hop crowd and younger fans who liked Usher's ''Yeah.'' 8, Bergen Performing Arts Center, 30 North Van Brunt Street, Englewood, N.J., (201) 816-8160; $35 to $55. (Sinagra) EXENE CERVENKA AND THE ORIGINAL SINNERS (Wednesday) The doyenne of Los Angeles punk rock and co-lead singer of the seminal rock group X does her own thing with this band. 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) CHIEFTAINS (Tonight) The Chieftains spearheaded a revival of Irish traditional music, playing only the oldest instruments: fiddle, harp, wooden flute, uileann pipes, bodhran, tin whistle. Then they decided that Irish tradition wasn't enough and started to look further afield: to Spain, to China, to rock. Their concerts started to rely more on personality and gimmicks than on music. But they have been returning to their Irish core, and there's a great ensemble behind the shtick. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $75. (Pareles) JOHN DOE (Tonight) The singer-songwriter John Doe has followed his years fronting the seminal punkers X with albums that are more low-key yet just as intimate. 9, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; $12. (Sinagra) THE GO! TEAM (Monday) This British group brilliantly merges the wistful nostalgic wing of sample-based post-rock with live junkyard bash, the sassy girl rap of MC Ninja, and cheerleader chants. Themes, hooks and digressions overlap. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) JOSE GONZALEZ (Wednesday) This singer-songwriter, a Swede of Argentinean descent, is one of those many devotees of Elliot Smith (who died at 34 in 2003) who do the intimate acoustic guitar and lulling vocal thing, but don't quite find the pathos. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $15. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) JOE HURLEY'S ALL STAR IRISH ROCK REVUE (Tonight) For the seventh year, Joe Hurley and his band spend St. Patrick's night backing up an assortment of singers, including Michael Cerveris, James Chance, John S. Hall, Mary Lee Kortes, Joe McGinty, Andy Shernoff and Tammy Faye Starlite, who will perform Irish gems by the likes of Thin Lizzy, U2, Van Morrison, Sinead O'Connor, Morrisey and the Pogues. The music starts at 7:15 with the Itinerants, followed by Joe Hurley & the Gents at 8. The Irish Review starts at 9. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sinagra) JENNY LEWIS & THE WATSON TWINS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Jenny Lewis is the frontwoman of Rilo Kiley, and her solo material is inspired by Laura Nyro-style 1970's white soul. Her combination of school-recital fussiness and barely-caught cry is in fine form, but it's her vocal tone and phrasing that make her special. Especially here, where her pointy songbird desperation is augmented by the gospel-tinged Watson Twins. 8:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $19.

(Sinagra) THE POGUES, THE WALKMEN (Tonight through Sunday) Before every beer-brewing ethnicity spawned a punk band modernizing its traditionals with distorted guitar and aggressive, often hilarious howls, there was Ireland's Pogues. Its leader, Shane MacGowan, a man of tossed-off wit, ubiquitous slur and few teeth, has picked up where he left off before the band went on hiatus in the 1990's. Mr. McGowan is also DJ-ing a special St. Patrick's Day show at Southpaw that's sure to be wild. (See www.spssounds.com for details.) The Walkmen were part of the rock is back scene of a few years ago and are back to say it's still back. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com, (212) 307-7171; $50. (All shows sold out.) (Sinagra) THE PRODIGY (Wednesday) The hard-edged techno of pulverizing songs like ''Firestarter'' were given theatrical flair by the group's leader, Liam Howlett, whose mercurial antics have made him a standout in the impersonal world of dance music. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com, (212) 307-7171; $35. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) MATT POND PA(Tuesday) This band has lots of nicely formed indie-pop songs, none very memorable. Live, however, the band, which features a cello, delivers with a forceful crispness. Doors open at 8 p.m., show at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $12. (Sinagra) SAM PREKOP (Sunday) Part of the Chicago group of musicians that pioneered mid-1990's jazz and electronic post-rock music, the singer and guitarist Prekop is a smooth, if overly genteel, singer and a fluid player. His group the Sea and Cake benefited from his light touch and wistful vocals. 7:30 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, between Sterling Place and St. John's Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $15. (Sinagra) THE RAKES, TOWERS OF LONDON (Tuesday) The Rakes' jagged riffs and tempos suggest the Strokes, though these London boys also recall their hometown's snarkier 1970's punkers. Towers of London play dedicated glam-rock à la the Darkness. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 (sold out). (Sinagra) SILVER JEWS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Few songwriters express their misery as poetically as the Silver Jews' David Berman. You really can't argue with lines like ''Sometimes a pony gets depressed'' and ''I wanna be like water if I can/ Cause water doesn't give a damn.'' His recent album, ''Tanglewood Numbers'' (Drag City), is his best. 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, (212) 353-1600; $20. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) STEREOLAB (Tonight and tomorrow night) The blip-blip movement of the 1990's never had such soothing purveyors of machine love, cooing socialist come-ons and retro-futurist airport lounge reveries. 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $25 and $35. (Sinagra) LEROY THOMAS AND THE ZYDECO ROADRUNNERS (Tomorrow) Straight from the bayou comes Leroy Thomas, who's part of zydeco's youth movement: singing in English and playing piano accordion, as well as the older-style single-row accordion while the rub board clatters merrily. 9 p.m., Connolly's on 45th, 121 West 45th Street, second floor, Manhattan, (212) 597-5126 or (212) 685-7597; $20.

(Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) * Barbara Cook (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) This Broadway legend is loose, down-home and, as always, magnificent, singing a 25-year retrospective of songs she has performed at the Café Carlyle. 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tomorrow night at 10:45, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $85; dinner required at the 8:45 shows.(Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. ALL THAT JAZZ: NOW THAT'S HIP! (Tuesday) This annual concert, sponsored by the HIP Health Plan of New York, traditionally features the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis with his bluesy septet; this edition also benefits from the inclusion of Curtis Stigers, a charismatic singer and saxophonist with a broadminded approach to repertory and a retro-stylized stage persona. 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, www.jalc.org; $105.50 and $135.50. (Nate Chinen) BILLY BANG GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) As a violinist and composer, Mr. Bang favors the astringency and formal tension of the 1970's loft scene; his frontline partner here is the equally adventurous saxophonist and flutist James Spaulding. 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) PATRICIA BARBER (Wednesday) Ms. Barber's lyrical verbosity and arch intellectualism are uncommon traits for a jazz singer; she also plays piano in her working band, which features the often-impressive guitarist Neal Alger. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42. (Chinen) KENNY BARRON TRIO (Tuesday through March 26) Mr. Barron is the leading practitioner of an elegant, economical and rhythmically surefooted piano style that thrives in any mainstream setting; he'll most likely explore at least a few different styles here, with Kiyoshi Kitagawa on bass and Francisco Mela on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) PAUL BOLLENBACK QUINTET (Wednesday) As on his self-assured new album, ''Brightness of Being'' (Elefant Dreams), the guitarist Paul Bollenback brings a sleek post-bop ethos to material ranging from Ray Charles to Puccini, with a strong ensemble including Gary Thomas on tenor and soprano saxophone, Chris McNulty on vocals and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) * ANTHONY BRAXTON 12+1(TET) (Tonight through Sunday night) Mr. Braxton, the saxophonist and composer, is a monumental but often puzzling figure in the avant-garde; yet his influence has resonated clearly with a bright new generation of players, a dozen of whom will perform his music here. 8 and 10, with an 11:30 show tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) IGOR BUTMAN QUARTET (Wednesday through March 25) Mr. Butman is a powerfully proficient tenor and soprano saxophonist and Russia's most accomplished jazz musician; he teams up with one of his countrymen (the pianist Andrei Kondakov) and a pair of top-flight Americans (the bassist Eddie Gomez and the drummer Lenny White). 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) ELLERY ESKELIN TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Eskelin is a tenor saxophonist known for gruff abandon; his longtime band with the accordionist Andrea Parkins and the drummer Jim Black handles abstraction as well as groove. 8:30, Roulette at Location One, 20 Greene Street, below Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen) GREAT AMERICAN SONGWRITERS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Few musicians are better equipped to luxuriate in songbook standards than the pianist Bill Charlap; here he takes a look at the music of Vernon Duke (''April in Paris,'' ''Autumn in New York'') with the vocalist Ethel Ennis and the tenor saxophonist Houston Person. 7:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, www.lincolncenter.org; $105.50 to $135.50. (Chinen) * ICP ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) The acronym stands for Instant Composers Pool, which conveys both the immediacy and the structural integrity of this 10-piece ensemble's creations; the group also happens to contain Amsterdam's finest improvisers, like the pianist Misha Mengelberg, the drummer Han Bennink and the saxophonist and clarinetist Michael Moore. 8 and 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $12, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) JASON KAO HWANG/EDGE (Tuesday) Mr. Hwang, a probing violinist and composer, marks the release of his new album on the Asian Improv label; as on the album, he enlists Taylor Ho Bynum on cornet, Ken Filiano on bass and Andrew Drury on drums. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10.(Chinen) CHRIS LIGHTCAP QUINTET (Tonight and Sunday night) A bassist with credentials in both straight-ahead and experimental circles, Mr. Lightcap fronts a group well suited to split the difference: Mark Turner and Tony Malaby on tenor saxophones, Craig Taborn on Fender Rhodes and Gerald Cleaver on drums. Tonight at 9 , Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. Sunday at 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934; no cover. (Chinen) DOM MINASI TRIO +1 (Thursday) Minasi is an estimable guitarist in experimental circles; as on his jangly new album, ''Vampire's Revenge'' (CDM), he augments his working trio with special guests -- in this case, the gutsy trombonist Steve Swell. 8 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) TED NASH AND ODEON (Tuesday) Mr. Nash is an expansively gifted saxophonist, equally at home finessing standards or chasing progressive forms of his own design. His Odeon band -- a flea-market assemblage of violin, accordion, woodwinds, brass and drums -- exposes the underlying affinities between many strains of low- and high-minded music. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) THE PARK AVENUE WHIRL (Tuesday through March 25) This exuberant swing-minded confab pairs Daryl Sherman, the irrepressible standards singer, with Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks, New York's most transporting little big band. 8:30 p.m., Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095; cover, $71, with a $40 minimum. (Chinen) EDWARD SIMON TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow night) As a pianist and composer, Mr. Simon is both harmonically resourceful and rhythmically advanced, traits that should serve him well as he leads a trio with the bassist John Patitucci and the drummer Nasheet Waits. 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen) BOBO STENSON TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow night) With ''Goodbye'' (ECM), the Swedish pianist Bobo Stenson offered one of last year's most beautifully somber piano trio recordings. Here he plays the only live performances with the same personnel from the album: his fellow Swede and longtime bassist Anders Jormin, and the august and inscrutable New York drummer Paul Motian. 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) MARCUS STRICKLAND'S TWI-LIFE (Wednesday) Mr. Strickland, a thoughtful young tenor saxophonist, leads an ensemble of fellow up-and-comers: Lage Lund on guitar, Matt Brewer on bass, and E. J. Strickland, his twin brother, on drums. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen) TRIBUTE TO LUCKY THOMPSON (Wednesday through March 25) Thompson, who died last year at 81, was a bebop enigma, and his music has yet to be absorbed into jazz culture; next week the tenor and soprano saxophonist Chris Byars investigates that legacy in four ensembles, including a quartet (on Wednesday, with the former Thompson sideman John Hicks on piano) and a trio (on Thursday). 8 and 10 p.m. and 1:30 a.m., Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $15. (Chinen) MANUEL VALERA QUARTET (Thursday) On his new album, ''Melancolía'' (Mavo), the Cuban pianist Manuel Valera pursues a sophisticated strain of Latin jazz, occasionally tempered by classical romanticism; his message is in good hands with the tenor saxophonist Yosvany Terry, the bassist Hans Glawischnig and the drummer Ernesto Simpson. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $12 (members, $10).(Chinen) ABBY WHITESIDE FOUNDATION JAZZ TRIBUTE (Tuesday) This recital, under the auspices of a venerable school of piano pedagogy, will feature the radiant solo playing of Barry Harris and Fred Hersch (two of the foundation's current teachers), as well as that of Gregg Kallor, Michael Kanan and Pete Malinverni. 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Tonight through Sunday) The Amato Opera's reputation is that it conveys the spirit and love of Italian opera, though the full impact is impossible to achieve in a 102-seat theater with a cast that changes at every performance. And against the odds, the principals at a recent performance of ''Aida'' managed to make it through to the end, demonstrating a true love of the piece if not always of the pitch. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for 65+, students with ID, and children. (Anne Midgette) 'DARKLING' (Tonight and tomorrow night) In an adventurous move, America Opera Projects is presenting the premiere production of ''Darkling,'' a brave and sensitive, if at times frustrating, multimedia music theater work. With a score by the composer Stefan Weisman, ''Darkling'' is an ''operatic fantasia on themes of emotional fragmentation,'' in the words of the director, Michael Comlish, who conceived the idea of adapting for the stage the poet Anna Rabinowitz's book-length poem about a restless Polish couple who marry hastily before the invasion of the Nazis and who independently flee to the United States. 8, East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $45. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'FIDELIO' (Monday) The director Jürgen Flimm's grippingly updated production of Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' was a deserved popular success when it was first presented in 2000. It returns with the radiant soprano Karita Mattila again singing the role of Leonora, and Richard Margison as Florestan. (Paul Nadler will replace the conductor James Levine, who has withdrawn from the rest of the Met's season because of a shoulder injury.) 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $320. (Tommasini) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) It's tempting to say that ''Forza'' has the most numbingly witless libretto and the dippiest score of any Verdi opera, but with such stiff competition, who can truly say? Giancarlo del Monaco's drab staging, first seen in 1996 and hidden away in storage since then, offers little help, but the Met has a vocally solid cast, with Deborah Voigt as Leonora, and Salvatore Licitra as Don Alvaro. Mark Rucker sings Don Carlo tomorrow, and Mark Delavan returns to the role on Wednesday. Gianandrea Noseda conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $320 tomorrow; $26 to $320 on Wednesday. (Allan Kozinn) 'LUISA MILLER' (Tonight and Tuesday) Barbara Frittoli canceled, and Neil Shicoff was sick on opening night, so the Metropolitan Opera was left with the journeymen Veronica Villarroel and Eduardo Villa carrying Verdi's opera on their reliable if not very exciting shoulders. Mr. Shicoff is supposed to take over again when he recovers, joining Carlos Alvarez, who pumps out sound in a warm, unvaried baritone, and James Morris, who takes ''stentorian'' off the pitch chart altogether. (Karen Slack replaces Ms. Villarroel tonight.) 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $320. (Midgette) 'MAZEPPA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Tchaikovsky's epic 1884 opera ''Mazeppa,'' about the ruthless 17th-century Ukrainian separatist Ivan Mazeppa, is an anguished, probing and noble work. The Metropolitan Opera deserves thanks for presenting its first production of this inexplicably neglected masterpiece, inspiringly conducted by Valery Gergiev. A cast of mostly Russian singers brings conviction and palpable authority to the work, especially the baritone Nikolai Putilin as the wizened Mazeppa, and the soprano Olga Guryakova as his adolescent and impressionable wife. The musical performance is so compelling that you can almost ignore Yuri Alexandrov's jumbled and trashy projection, which clutters the opera with symbolism. (On Wednesday night the soprano Elena Evseeva sings the role of Maria.) Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $320. (Tommasini) 'THE MOST HAPPY FELLA' (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) Frank Loesser thought of his 1956 masterpiece ''The Most Happy Fella'' as a ''musical with a lot of music,'' not as an opera. Still, this musically sophisticated and disarming musical is a good fit for the New York City Opera, which has opened its spring season with a vibrant and charming production directed by Philip Wm. McKinley. The actor Paul Sorvino, making his City Opera debut, inhabits the title role of Tony Esposito, the paunchy and insecure but good-hearted Italian immigrant vineyard owner in the Napa Valley of the late 1920's. Mr. Sorvino's voice, though, is pretty raw and shaky. He's at his best when he doesn't care about how he sounds and just lets go. The rest of the cast, mostly from the musical theater world, is wonderful. Tonight at 8, tomorrow and Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 (final performance on March 25), New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570; $25 to $120. (Tommasini) 'OTELLO' (Thursday) Vincent La Selva is one of the best Verdi conductors around, but his arena these days is his own New York Grand Opera, playing free in Central Park or churches with variable (sometimes decent) singers, rather than standard opera houses. But it tends to be the tenor, not the conductor, that makes or breaks Verdi's ''Otello,'' and Edward Perretti may not be quite up to it. 7:30 p.m., Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, corner of West End Avenue and West 86th Street, (212) 245-8837; free. (Midgette) Classical Music * AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Steven Sloane leads this new-music orchestra in a concert that explores the recent influence of pop technology -- including electronica, D.J.'s and turntablists, along with computer programming -- on classical composers.

(Kozinn) ESTONIAN PHILHARMONIC CHAMBER CHOIR (Sunday) Two of Estonia's best-known musical exports, Arvo Pärt and this choir, join in this weekend's concert. Mr. Pärt's music, accessible, meditative, bell-like, forms the centerpiece of a choral and organ concert that includes a New York premiere (''Anthem of St. John the Baptist''). It's juxtaposed with excerpts from Rachmaninoff's ''All-Night Vigil'' and a set of songs by an Estonian composer and ethnomusicologist of an older generation, with the euphonious name of Cyrillus Kreek. 4 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue, at 84th Street, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Midgette) RICHARD GOODE (Sunday) What was to have been the sixth event in the pianist Richard Goode's Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, originally scheduled for Jan. 14 but postponed because of the withdrawal of one of the participants, will take place on Sunday afternoon, bringing this engrossing series to a close. The mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford will sing a selection of Schubert lieder with Mr. Goode at the piano, setting up his performance of Schubert's late Sonata in B flat. Then the tenor Matthew Polenzani joins the pianist for Janacek's haunting dramatic song cycle ''The Diary of One Who Disappeared.'' 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $44 to $52.

(Eichler) MATT HAIMOVITZ (Sunday) This itinerant power-cellist has made headlines for bringing classical music into clubs like CBGB's. This weekend, he performs the first of three shows at the Knitting Factory, with guests D.J. Olive, a cello band called Uccello and Constantinople, a period-instrument ensemble that specializes in early music from Europe and the Middle East. The program draws from Mr. Haimovitz's new Bartok-themed album called ''Goulash'' 7:30 p.m., the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $20 to $25. (Eichler) LONDON PHILHARMONIC (Sunday and Monday) The ailing Kurt Masur has dropped out of these programs. Neemi Jarvi is the replacement in New Jersey, and Roberto Minczuk conducts at Lincoln Center. Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; $22 to $76. Monday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69.

(Bernard Holland) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow) Xian Zhang, the bright young assistant at the New York Philharmonic, conducts a morning concert of Rossini, Tchaikovsky and Paganini. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $23 to $76. (Holland) ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S (Sunday) Ian Bostridge joins this fine orchestra and its music director, Donald Runnicles, for Lutoslawski's ''Paroles Tissées'' and arias from Handel's ''Ariodante.'' Mr. Runnicles also leads his players in Stravinsky's ''Dumbarton Oaks'' Concerto and Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $74. (Kozinn) PRISM QUARTET (Tonight) This fine veteran saxophone ensemble plays music by the much respected yet seldom heard Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino. 8:30, Thalia Theater, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $21; students and 65+, $18. (Eichler) * THOMAS QUASTHOFF (Tonight and tomorrow) The great German bass-baritone Thomas Quasthoff performs Schubert's ''Schöne Müllerin'' tomorrow night at Carnegie Hall with his frequent accompanist, the elegant pianist Justus Zeyen. Tonight a Young Artists Concert at Weill Hall presents four selected singers with their pianist partners, emerging musicians who were coached by Mr. Quasthoff this past week in two public master classes. In an indirect way, this concert should also provide insights into Mr. Quasthoff's probing artistry. Tonight at 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall; $23 to $79. (Tommasini) PAULA ROBISON (Tomorrow) This series by the flutist Paula Robison looks at Vivaldi's concertos and has so far offered some rarely heard ones in graceful, shapely performances in the cavernous Temple of Dendur. 7 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $60. (Kozinn) * CHARLES ROSEN (Sunday) Charles Rosen is as renowned for his insightful books and essays as for his probing performances. He is celebrating the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth by looking at composers who influenced him and composers who felt his influence. The current installment looks at Beethoven's fascination with Mozart by way of his Piano Sonata No. 32 (Op. 111) and his Variations on ''Bei Männern, Welche Liebe Fühlen'' from ''The Magic Flute,'' for which Fred Sherry joins him on the cello. Also, Mozart's Fantasia (K. 475) and Sonata in C minor (K. 457). 1:30 p.m. (a lecture) and 3 p.m. (the recital), 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Kozinn) TOKYO STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Tokyo continues its close ties to the 92d Street Y and its celebration of the Mozart year with two string quartets and the E flat Piano Quartet with Alexander Lonquich. 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $40. (Holland) * WALL TO WALL STRAVINSKY (Tomorrow) What better way to celebrate a prodigious musical life than with acornucopia of music? This year's installment of Symphony Space's ''Wall to Wall'' series of free 12-hour marathons focusing on one composer spotlights Igor Stravinsky, who aroused reactions from shock to adoration in his lifetime. His work ranges from the very early (like the 1904 song ''The Mushrooms Go to War'') to the greatest hits (like ''Symphonies of Wind Instruments''). Participating artists include the pianist Jeremy Denk, the singers Lucy Shelton and Marni Nixon, the Ying Quartet and, yes, Richard Thomas and Leonard Nimoy playing, in ''Story of a Soldier,'' the Soldier and the Devil. 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-1414, ext. 286; free. (A limited number of reserved seats will be available for donors of $125 or more.) (Midgette) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. LES BALLETS AFRICAINS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Also known as the National Ensemble of the Republic of Guinea, the company will celebrate its half-century of existence with ''Jubilee,'' a selection of its golden oldies in music and dance. 8, Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 545-7536 or worldmusicinstitute.org; $35 and $45; students, $15. (Jennifer Dunning) JANE COMFORT AND COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Comfort's new ''Fleeting Thoughts: Mr. Henderson's 3 a.m.'' is set to vocal music by Joan La Barbara. The work explores extremes of timing, spatial relationships and language. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Dunning) COMPLEXIONS (Tonight through Sunday and Thursday) This exuberant modern-dance company will perform a program that includes a tribute to Nina Simone and a piece set to music by Earth, Wind and Fire. (Through March 26.) Tonight and Thursday night at 7; tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 5 p.m. New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 563-2266, www.newvictory.org; $10 to $30. (Dunning) * SALLY GROSS AND COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Gross calls her program ''Seeing Winter Out,'' and the poetic title says a lot about this most eloquent minimalist. Among the new works is ''With Words #2,'' a solo Ms. Gross dances to a rehearsal tape by Joseph Chaikin. 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $15. (Dunning) KINETIC ARCHITECTURE (Tonight through Sunday) Shannon and Rob Davidson describe their new ''Grios,'' an investigation of Celtic culture and mythology, as a cross between Buster Keaton and Butoh. 8 p.m., Center for Remembering and Sharing, 123 Fourth Avenue, near 12th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, www.theatermania.com; $12; students and 65+, $10. (Dunning) * SUSAN MARSHALL AND COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Marshall celebrates her company's 20th anniversary with ''Cloudless,'' an impressive new piece that addresses human relationships and the surreal edge of everyday life with psychological, theatrical and visual complexity. 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25. (Dunning) * YVONNE MEIER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Meier is returning after eight years to her enjoyably anarchic improvisational choreography. For her new pieces ''this is not a pink pony'' and ''Gogolorez,'' she has enlisted the aid of downtown-dance stars like Miguel Gutierrez, Jennifer Monson, Nami Yamamoto and Jeremy Wade. 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, www.thekitchen.org; $12. (Dunning) BENJAMIN MILLEPIED (Tonight through Sunday) One of the smartest and liveliest of New York City Ballet dancers, Mr. Millepied will lead his company, whose roster includes several bright young City Ballet performers and the American Ballet Theater star Gillian Murphy, in a new work of his own, set to a score by Philip Glass, played by Pedja Muzijevic, as well as in new works by the choreographers Aszure Barton, Andonis Foniadakis and Luca Veggetti. The last piece has an accompaniment cued by dancers' motions. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, www.joyce.org; $42. (Dunning) TERE O'CONNOR DANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) Audiences and reviewers tend to feel passionately about Mr. O'Connor's choreography, loving or hating it with equal intensity. Somehow Mr. O'Connor has lived through it all and continued to produce dances. This one is called ''Baby,'' which he describes as exploding the metaphor of time passing. You decide. (Through April 1.) 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25. (Dunning) SUMMERFEST '06: CHRISTINE JOWERS/MOVING ARTS PROJECTS (Wednesday) Ms. Jowers will present her ''Isadora and the Dancing Goddesses of NYC'' in a free performance by the Projects, which she describes as a ''sisterhood'' that includes such dance luminaries as Ann Carlson and Margie Gillis. 12:30 and 8 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505. (Dunning) * PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) The company's annual City Center season concludes with four final repertory programs. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, www.nycitycenter.org; $15 to $80. (John Rockwell) * TCHAIKOVSKY PERM BALLET AND ORCHESTRA (Tonight) These exquisite dancers from the Perm Ballet, which has a direct lineage to the Maryinsky, know how to tell a vivid story in the purest classical dance. Here they are in a traditional staging of ''Swan Lake'' by Natalia Makarova that includes Sir Frederick Ashton's haunting fourth act. 7:30, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $20 to $56. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. Her works do not lend themselves to easy deciphering, but her magic with materials and her daring compositional imagination draw you in. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff) NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's Klee's impact began to be felt in the United States. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work, from his dense, Cubist-style oil, ''When God Considered the Creation of the Plants'' (1913), to a beautifully stylized rendering of the jazz singer and dancer Josephine Baker (1927) to labyrinthine compositions like ''Or the Mocked Mocker'' (1930). 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck) P.S. 1: Jessica Stockholder: 'Of Standing Float Roots in Thin Air,' through May 1. A soaring, cannily designed installation -- made of airborne plastic bins, electric lights, orange extension cords and an old armchair topping a wooden tower -- by a sculptor known for orchestrating productive collisions of formalism and consumerism. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Ken Johnson) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. Beauty is hard to come by. Check out, among other things, Paul Chan's digital animation of shadowy objects like cellphones and bicycles, floating upward, Wizard of Oz-like, while bodies tumble down, the work cast as if it were light from a tall window slanting onto the floor of a dark room. And also Pierre Huyghe's film, shot in Antarctica and Central Park. It's really gorgeous: crosscut between day and night, fiction and reality, it encapsulates the show's operative but ultimately airy metaphor about the slippery state of art now. (''Day for Night'' is the biennial's first-ever title, after the François Truffaut film.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown Tony Cragg: 'Five Bottles' In the early 1980's, this eminent English sculptor made flat, mosaiclike works out of found colored plastic objects and fragments. This show presents a set of five wall-works, each representing a different giant colored bottle composed of toys, combs, cigarette lighters and other pieces of ordinary commercial detritus. Vivian Horan, 35 East 67th Street, (212) 517-9410, through April 21. (Johnson) Jim Shaw: 'My Mirage 1986- 91' This amazingly inventive California-based artist first became widely known for a series of about 170 works, all measuring 17 by 14 inches, that chronicles the life of a white suburban boy named Billy, from innocent youth to druggy degradation to born-again salvation. The 30 pieces from the series in this show variously imitate comic strips, acid-rock posters, thrift store paintings, comic greeting cards and many other pop culture forms. Skarstedt, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 737-2060, through April 1. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Tjorg Douglas Beer: 'Hirnwaschanlage BrainWashing Plant' Something resembling a large-scale, Cubist puppet theater that looks as if it were designed and built by elementary school students is the main attraction of this German artist's first United States solo exhibition. Populated by robotic figures of cardboard and aluminum foil, with glowing light bulbs for eyes, which wield medieval weapons, it is supposed to be based on the Donkey Kong video game and to represent the interior of a brain under the influence of social brainwashing. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, through March 25. (Johnson) Jeff Chien-Hsing Liao: 'Habitat 7' The winner of the second annual ''Capture the Times'' photography contest of The New York Times Magazine presents a series of vividly clear and colorful, wide-angle pictures of outdoor scenes shot along the No. 7 subway line, which runs through Queens. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410, through March 25. (Johnson) * MARK LECKY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark, and adds another twist to the convoluted history of appropriation art. GBE@Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, (212) 627-5258, through April 22. (Smith) * William Nicholson Though less well known than his son, the British abstract painter Ben Nicholson, Sir William Nicholson was a successful artist in his day. The mostly small landscapes, portraits and Chardinesque still lifes in this beautiful show offer transporting fusions of paint and imagery. Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, through March 25. (Johnson) Barbara Probst Ms. Probst displays pairs and groups of photographs made using electronically connected cameras able to shoot scenes from different angles at exactly the same time. Seeing a family crossing the street in black and white from the top of a building and close-up in color from street level creates a philosophically intriguing collapse of the normal space-time continuum. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through March 25. (Johnson) Rachel Whiteread: 'Bibliography' Cardboard boxes cast in plaster are displayed in monotonous profusion singly and in groups by the British sculptor who once made a concrete cast of the inside of a whole house. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through April 1. (Johnson) Other Galleries * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed; punk and new wave rock assailed the ears; graffiti spread like kudzu; and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) THE STUDIO VISIT The studio visit, a time-honored ritual that everyone in the art world has both endured and learned from, is taken to its limit in Exit Art's latest exhibition marathon. Each of the 160 mostly short videos represents one artist's idea of, play on, or substitute for, a studio visit. It is a show that often cries out for a fast-forward button, but there are some notable gems -- for example, by Joyce Pensato, Cynthia von Buhler, Ida Applebroog, Bruce Pearson, Lance Wakeling, Taylor McKimens, Paul Wirhun, Elisabeth Kley, Christy Gast and Kim Jones. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 966-7745, through March 25. (Smith) Last Chance * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * 'EXQUISITE CORPSE-CADAVRE EXQUIS' The Surrealist drawing game provided this show's organizers -- the gallery's owner and the independent curator Robert Nickas -- with their call-and-response selection process, as well as their theme. The three dozen small works tend to focus on the body, mostly beautiful and often sexual, which only increases the fascination of the almost always illuminating aesthetic couplings they have devised. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Birdie Lusch: 'Collages' The self-taught Lusch (1903-1988) worked in a ball-bearing factory in Columbus, Ohio, and began making art as a teenager. This show presents 24 delightful pages from a 1983 album of collages representing flowers in vases. KS Art, 73 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-9918; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) P.S. 1: 'Ricky Swallow,' Extraordinarily realistic and symbolically portentous sculptures carved from wood by Australia's representative to last summer's Venice Biennale, in which three of the five works on view here were included. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084; closes Monday.

Broadway * 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LESTAT' A musical sleeping pill, adapted from Anne Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' and featuring songs by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, that could well give the makers of Ambien a run for their money. Dare to look upon this tale of the undead and keep your eyelids from growing heavier and heavier and heavier (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotes from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka) 'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'THE CONTRAST' Royall Tyler's slender 1787 romantic comedy -- one of the first professional American plays ever produced -- should be of more interest to historians than to theatergoers (2:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman) 'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Scott Ellis's underpowered production of Joe Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which stars Alec Baldwin in a comedy sketch of a performance, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Hunka) 'GUARDIANS' Peter Morris's play juxtaposes the moral decline of two disparate characters caught up in the destructive tailwinds of the American invasion of Iraq: a cold-blooded tabloid journalist in London and a soldier in the United States Army. Lee Pace and Katherine Moennig give persuasive performances as the sleazy hack and the scapegoated grunt, but Mr. Morris's play is more flashily provocative than truly thoughtful (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Isherwood) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plotline -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST' Lynn Redgrave is an unusually vigorous Lady Bracknell in Sir Peter Hall's new production of Oscar Wilde's peerless comedy from 1895. A satisfactory production that works effectively as a romantic farce but more erratically as a vehicle for Wilde's paradox-perfumed wit. (2:25) Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Isherwood) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SORE THROATS' Howard Brenton's scabrous 1979 drama about the bilious aftermath of a British marriage. Laila Robins and Bill Camp are a middle-aged, newly divorced couple warring over the past and the future. The play's insights into the irreducible conflict between human needs and the constraints of civilization are a little murky (2:10). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'ADVENTURES OF CAVEMAN ROBOT: THE MUSICAL' A disjointed but vivid homage and musical parody, by Jeff Lewonczyk and Debby Schwartz, of comic books and superheroes. Sloppy and long, too (2:10). Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, at Lorimer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 907-3457. (Hunka) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.( Lawrence Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'MACRUNE'S GUEVARA' The Young Mirror arm of Mirror Repertory revives John Spurling's odd 1969 play about an artist who left behind a wall full of drawings of Che Guevara, and the man who saw something profound in them. Parts of the play read today like a funny sendup of art critics who see too much brilliance in outsider-art gibberish; other parts seem a bit like gibberish of their own (2:15). St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing Wednesday. (Genzlinger) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. (Dana Stevens) * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Stephen Holden) * 'THE DEATH OF MR. LAZARESCU' (R, 154 minutes, in Romanian) This Romanian film follows the grueling final hours of an ailing, alcoholic 62-year-old man in Bucharest, as he is shuttled among four city hospitals. A sustained triumph of ensemble acting, the film seems so absolutely real that it absorbs you into its world in the same way that a documentary like Frederick Wiseman's ''Hospital'' seeps into your consciousness.(Holden) 'GUYS AND BALLS' (R, 106 minutes, in German) In the German soccer comedy ''Guys and Balls,'' a baker's son (Maximilian Brückner) who is gay forms an all-gay team to defeat his hometown homophobes. Groaning with double-entendres and flaming gay stereotypes, the movie's climactic game offers some of the most sustained -- and literal -- gay bashing in movie history, even if the outcome is no more surprising than that of any other underdog comedy. Adam Sandler is probably already in training.(Jeannette Catsoulis) 'HOW I KILLED A SAINT' (No rating, 82 minutes, in Macedonian and English) Set in Macedonia during the 2001 civil conflict with the country's ethnic Albanians, ''How I Killed a Saint'' views the crisis through the eyes of two deeply troubled siblings. Filmed in a covert, voyeuristic style that's virtually devoid of close-ups, the movie successfully conveys the pervasive anxiety of a country teetering on the brink of civil war. (Catsoulis) 'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis) * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Manohla Dargis) 'LADY VENGEANCE' (R, 111 minutes, in Korean) Park Chanwook completes his ''vengeance trilogy'' with this kinder, gentler exercise in pulp pyrotechnics and empty virtuosity. (Nathan Lee) * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis) 'THE LOST CITY' (R, 143 minutes) Andy Garcia's ode to the Havana of pre-Communist Cuba is a romantic epic manqué that swoons across the screen for nearly 2 1/2 hours without saying much beyond the fact that life sure was peachy before Fidel Castro came to town and ruined everything. (Holden) * 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis) 'SCARY MOVIE 4' (PG-13, 83 minutes) This parasitic franchise is back to feed on last year's disposable distractions, proving, if nothing else, that there's a laugh or two left in ''Brokeback Mountain'' parodies and Viagra overdoses. (Lee) 'RV' (PG, 102 minutes) Nowadays, no family movie is complete without a values-oriented agenda and a bountiful supply of fecal matter, and ''RV'' supplies both. Robin Williams is an overworked executive trying to reconnect with his family on a mobile-home vacation. Barry Sonnenfeld directs with one eye on the production and the other on the clock, producing a movie that feels as clapped-out as the titular vehicle itself. (Catsoulis) 'THE SENTINEL' (PG-13, 108 minutes) The question is why: why would a star of Michael Douglas's stature and obvious intelligence attach himself to a Washington thriller as deeply ridiculous, suspense-free and potentially career-damaging as ''The Sentinel''? (Holden) * 'SIR! NO SIR!' (No rating, 84 minutes) In this smart, very timely documentary, the filmmaker David Zeiger revisits one of the memorable and least revisited chapters of the Vietnam War, the antiwar movement inside the military.(Dargis) * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Lee) 'SUITE HABANA' (No rating, 80 minutes, in Spanish) Fernando Pérez tracks a day in 10 ordinary lives in Havana. It may not be a representative portrait of the city, but its most compelling subjects, especially a widower and his disabled son, linger in the mind. (Neil Genzlinger) 'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis) * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis) 'THE WHORE'S SON' (No rating, 86 minutes, in German) Michael Sturminger's unsentimental German-language debut feature fearlessly plumbs the depths of an intense mother-son relationship, in which Ozren (appearing at ages 3, 8 and 16) becomes more aware, as the years pass, that his beloved mother, Silvija, is a high-class prostitute. (Laura Kern) 'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis) Film Series ROBERT ALTMAN (Through June 8) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work continues this weekend with features including ''Thieves Like Us'' (1974), starring Keith Carradine and Shelley Duvall as Bonnie and Clyde types; ''Secret Honor'' (1983), with Philip Baker Hall as Richard M. Nixon; and three episodes of ''Tanner '88,'' the pseudodocumentary mini-series with Michael Murphy as a golden but fictional presidential candidate. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates) B-NOIR (Through June 15) Film Forum's six-week festival of 70 low-budget American thrillers from the 1940's and 50's begins with two double features. Robert Aldrich's Mickey Spillane crime drama ''Kiss Me Deadly'' (1955), with Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer, and Stanley Kubrick's classic heist picture ''The Killing'' (1956) will be shown today and tomorrow. Two Robert Wise films, ''The Set-Up'' (1949), with Robert Ryan as an over-the-hill boxer, and ''The Captive City'' (1952), about a seemingly peaceful town under the thumb of a local tycoon and his gangsters, will be shown on Sunday. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates) A BRIEF ENCOUNTER WITH NOËL COWARD On Wednesdays in May, the Donnell Media Center is screening Coward films from the 1940's, his most prolific period. Next Wednesday's feature is ''In Which We Serve'' (1942), a war drama about a British destroyer, starring and directed by Coward (1899-1973). The series will also include ''This Happy Breed'' (1947), ''Blithe Spirit'' (1945) and, of course, ''Brief Encounter'' (1945). 20 West 53rd Street, (212) 621-0609; free. (Gates) THE FILMS OF MIKIO NARUSE (Through Wednesday) BAMcinématek's tribute to Naruse (1905-69), the Japanese realist filmmaker, continues this weekend with three films. ''Summer Clouds'' (1958) is about a rural war widow who has an affair with a newspaper reporter. ''Floating Clouds'' (1955) is Naruse's masterpiece about a typist and an engineer in postwar Tokyo. ''When a Woman Ascends the Stairs'' (1960) is the story of an aging bar hostess in the Ginza bar district. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) REDISCOVERING ROSCOE: THE CAREER OF FATTY ARBUCKLE (Through May 15). The Museum of Modern Art's 54-film retrospective of the acting and directing career of the scandal-ridden Arbuckle (1887-1933) continues this weekend with a program of silent films directed by Arbuckle, including ''Fatty's Reckless Fling'' (1915) and a program of four 1917 films starring Arbuckle and Buster Keaton. (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: DISCOVERING SYRIAN CINEMA (Through May 18) A series of Syrian features, documentaries and shorts, sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and ArteEast, begins today. This weekend's films include Oussama Mohammad's ''Stars in Broad Daylight'' (1988), a drama about a double wedding; Mohammad Malas's ''Dreams of the City'' (1983); and Abdellatif Abdul-Hamid's ''Nights of the Jackals'' (1989), about a peasant family with a neighborhood noise problem. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. BAMBOOZLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) Somehow it is appropriate that this two-day festival, a cluster of a few dozen bands with a big presence on MySpace.com, is taking the form of a huge, flat sprawl in the Meadowlands parking lots: an endless web of fans and bands blending together. Fall Out Boy headlines tomorrow, followed by, among many others, All American Rejects, Hawthorne Heights, Thursday, Mewithoutyou, Minus the Bear, Motion City Soundtrack, Relient K, Armor for Sleep, Keating, the Killing Sequence and Streetlight Manifesto. On Sunday, Taking Back Sunday headlines, with AFI, Captured by Robots, From Autumn to Ashes, Him, Moneen, Saves the Day, Panic! at the Disco, Say Anything, Poison the Well and the festival's token hip-hop star, Method Man. At 11:30 a.m., Meadowlands Sports Complex, Routes 3 and 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900 or (212) 307-7171; $32 both days. (Ben Sisario) BLACK LIPS, SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE (Tonight) Fresh from their appearances opening up for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at the cavernous Roseland, the Black Lips, from Atlanta, have a gig that is more their size. The band plays a grisly version of 1960's garage rock that sounds deliberately damaged. With Soldiers of Fortune -- which includes members of the garage-metal-experimental band Oneida, Jah Division and the countryish Oakley Hall -- and Mountains of Mattalama. At 10, Place, Norman and Kingsland Avenues, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, www.toddpnyc.com; $8. (Sisario) * THE BOOKS (Tonight) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of seemingly incongruous elements: disembodied vocal samples, a few plucks from a banjo or another string instrument, and unclassifiable noises that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening to their music is trying to figure out just why it all works so wonderfully and wittily. Their performance will incorporate video as well as audio, and their opening act is the always adventurous violinist Todd Reynolds, of the string quartet Ethel. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; sold out. (Sisario) BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Wednesday) This tuneless headache of a band, modeled on the jangly psychedelic rock of Britain and Los Angeles in the mid-1960's as well as the self-destructive persona of Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, was on its way into obscurity when, two years ago, it was featured in a hit documentary, ''Dig!,'' and a legend was created. Since then the band has toured widely, to large audiences who wait for its leader, Anton Newcombe, to lash out in paranoia and, as he did in the film, kick a fan in the head. With the Lilys. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20. (Sisario) CLEM SNIDE (Tomorrow and Monday) With a homely, nasal tenor and a few lonesome strums on his guitar, Eef Barzelay, the lead singer and chief songwriter of the band Clem Snide, can picture heartache and regret in trompe-l'oeil precision or, if the mood strikes him, simply goof off. In one song on his new solo album, ''Bitter Honey'' (SpinArt), he takes on the persona of a woman whose rear end makes an appearance in a video: ''It was on screen for a second but was kind of hard to miss.'' With Elvis Perkins, a band from Rhode Island that borrows Clem Snide's spacious sound without Mr. Barzelay's quirks. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. Monday at 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sisario) CONCRETES (Monday) This eight-piece group from Stockholm specializes in the kind of breezy, nostalgic chamber-pop popularized by Belle and Sebastian, with hummable and carefully orchestrated hymns to innocence and sunshine. Opening the show is the Australian singer and songwriter Sally Seltmann, performing under the stage name New Buffalo. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sisario) EVAN DANDO (Tonight) Mr. Dando, the lead heartthrob of the Lemonheads -- who by many reports did a surprisingly credible job singing with the reunited MC5 two years ago, though most fans had none of it -- plays a solo show. With the Hymns. At 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $15. (Sisario) * FAUN FABLES, BARBEZ (Tomorrow) On a bed of ghostly acoustic folk, Faun Fables's Dawn McCarthy and Nils Frykdahl build an astonishing and unpredictable kind of pop theater, at once grandiose and nightmarish and silly. Their new album, ''The Transit Rider'' (Drag City), is a creepily obsessive song cycle about the commuting life, which the band will perform in costume, with films and a cast of four. Barbez, from New York, finds an enticing middle ground between Kurt Weill's cabaret, droning avant-garde rock and the twinkling perpetual-motion pieces of Erik Satie. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario) PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive rock curriculum at his school in Philadelphia, teaching youngsters the canon as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. For three weekends this month, his students will visit CBGB to show off their mastery of the classics. The residency begins with the music of Frank Zappa, which received a spirited reading in the film. (Next are the Beatles and AC/DC.) 4 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $10. (Sisario) INXS (Tonight) Last year ''Rock Star: INXS,'' the reality series on CBS, picked a new singer for the onetime hit makers of INXS, whose original singer and only recognizable member, Michael Hutchence, died in 1997. The winner was one J. D. Fortune, a former Elvis impersonator who became -- this was reality TV, remember -- a Michael Hutchence impersonator. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; $49.50 to $79.50. (Sisario) YUNGCHEN LHAMO (Tonight) Long exiled from Tibet, Ms. Lhamo sings tender and mournful prayers about struggle and forgiveness, set to a soothing New Age sound that incorporates foamy electronics, electric guitars and assorted world-music instruments, like the African kora. Tonight she appears with some guests from her new album, ''Ama'' (Real World), including the British singer Joy Askew. At 8, Lerner Hall Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 115th Street, Morningside Heights, (866) 468-7619; $25; $21 for members of Tibet House; $17 for students and Tibetans. (Sisario) * LIGHTNING BOLT (Sunday) At first it is hard to believe that all the glorious chaos of Lightning Bolt -- a stalwart of the big noise-punk scene in Providence, R.I. -- is being made by only two people, the bassist Brian Gibson and the drummer and vocalist Brian Chippendale. But as the sound comes into focus, a playful give-and-take becomes clear, as Mr. Gibson and Mr. Chippendale toss back and forth gigantic metal riffs and giggly high notes, creating rainbows of dissonance. This concert, before the band goes on a European tour, is a benefit for Tarantula Hill, a performance space in Baltimore that was recently damaged by a fire. Also on the bill are the Brooklyn sludge-rockers Double Leopards, the Baltimore duo Nautical Almanac and Kites, a one-man noise factory from Providence. At 7 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Richards Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007; $10. (Sisario) MASTERS OF INDIAN MUSIC (Tonight) U. Shrinivas is not only a virtuoso on the electric mandolin but also a clever innovator: he made modifications on his instrument to adapt it for the Carnatic classical style of southern India. Born in 1969, he has long bridged classical and pop styles, first as a prodigy at jazz festivals and later with John McLaughlin and his group Remember Shakti. He appears in a World Music Institute concert with his brother U. Rajesh, who also plays the mandolin. At 8, Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, (212) 545-7536; $30; $15 for students. (Sisario) MATMOS (Tonight) M. C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel of the San Francisco electronic group Matmos make music out of almost any found sounds: playing cards being shuffled, the slurping of liposuction, even melting ice. The effect can be lighthearted and playful or eerily disconcerting, as on one track on the group's latest album, ''The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of the Beast'' (Matador), in which robotic voices discuss ''pain in someone else's body'' over the mechanical ticking of typewriters. At 7, Whitney Museum of American Art, (800) 944-8639; free with pay-what-you-wish museum admission, but a $75 season pass to the Whitney Live series guarantees a seat. (Sisario) MINDLESS SELF INDULGENCE (Thursday) Bands merging high-adrenaline industrial rock with a carnival-of-freaks theatricality had a pretty good run in the 90's, the era of Ministry, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult and Marilyn Manson. But fans are not ready to put away their black lipstick just yet, if the grass-roots success of this New York group is any indication. This show kicks off four nights at Avalon, two already sold out. 8 p.m., 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) THURSTON MOORE (Wednesday) Mr. Moore, one of the guitarists in Sonic Youth and an eternal symbol of casually omnivorous eclecticism, plays two sets of improvisations, the first solo and the second with unnamed guests. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; $10 per set. (Sisario) NORTEC COLLECTIVE (Tonight) A loose confederation of musicians and visual artists, the Nortec Collective is devoted to the cutting, rearranging and pasting of norteño -- the vibrant border style of accordions and oompah brass known on this side of the border as Tex-Mex. At midnight, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) * PELICAN, MONO (Tuesday) It's almost a misnomer to call Pelican a metal band. This four-piece instrumental group does indeed play loud, chunky power chords in the Melvins tradition, but with a sense of tragic drama that keeps the songs at a slow, reflective pace. With Mono, an instrumental group from Japan that flies from light turbulence into magnificent storms of noise. 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; $15 in advance, $16 at the door. (Sisario) PINBACK (Tuesday and Wednesday) This band from San Diego, centered on Zach Smith and Rob Crow, makes modesty a virtue. Its songs move at deliberate speed with glimmers of twanged guitar or electronic blips; its vocals are conversational, full of disappointment and wistful hopes. With Pleaseeasaur. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; sold out. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16 in advance and $18 at the door. (Jon Pareles) * JOSH RITTER, HEM (Tonight) A guileless, boy-next-door voice is the first clue that Mr. Ritter doesn't need a lot of fancy tricks to make a point. Powerfully minimal songwriting is another. But there is no limit to the depth and ambition of his songs, whether he is confessing a simple crush or following his thoughts on a long, Whitmanesque incantation, as he does for more than nine minutes on ''Thin Blue Flame'' from his new album, ''The Animal Years'' (V2). Hem plays somewhat prosaic alt-country, but in such delicate, sensuous arrangements that it doesn't matter. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) SAW DOCTORS (Thursday) The Saw Doctors sing earnest, folk-rocking anthems of small-town life ''for those who feel they've been mistreated/Discriminated, robbed or cheated.'' In Ireland their populism has brought them a huge national following; even in New York City, there should be plenty of voices with brogues singing along. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $26.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) OBIE TRICE (Tuesday) Obie Trice emerged a few years ago as a solid protégé of Eminem; 50 Cent made his appearance around the same time, though, and most of the world forgot about Eminem's other protégés. But Mr. Trice has remained a good soldier. His new single, ''Snitch,'' is a humorless warning to a stool pigeon: ''This act is not permitted.'' Gulp! 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. * KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) This regal cabaret singer and the brassy songs of Kander and Ebb that she is offering in her new show may not be an obvious fit. But Ms. Akers locates the heart inside the brass and sass. At 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; cover, $60, with a $20 minimum; $60 prix fixe dinner required on Thursdays and at the early shows tonight and tomorrow. (Stephen Holden) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Holden) BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. At 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. MEMORIAL FOR DEREK BAILEY (Through May 31) The iconoclastic guitarist Derek Bailey had originally intended to perform with many of the artists he assembled for this monthlong run, which now serves as a fitting tribute. Highlights in the coming week include a percussion duo of Cyro Baptista and Billy Martin (tomorrow), an evening with the noise-rock guitarist Thurston Moore (Wednesday) and a group called Audible Means, led by the bassist Lisle Ellis (Thursday). At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Nate Chinen) STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Led by the slide trumpeter Steven Bernstein, this little big band dusts off an obscure swing-era repertory with showmanship and irreverence. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $12. (Chinen) ANDY BEY (Through Sunday) Intimacy is a hallmark of Mr. Bey's vocal style, which alternates between a rich baritone and a burnished falsetto. He's also a fine pianist, as he'll demonstrate with this quartet featuring the guitarist Paul Meyers. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25 and $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) BISHOP-CLEAVER-FLOOD (Wednesday) As on his new album, ''Time and Imaginary Time'' (Envoi), the saxophonist Andrew Bishop engages in a communicative exchange with the drummer Gerald Cleaver and the bassist Tim Flood, expanding compositional frames and exploring open space. At 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) GERALD CLEAVER'S VIOLET HOUR (Tomorrow) Mr. Cleaver's suggestive pulse as a drummer has served him well in both conventional and experimental settings. His less heralded compositional vision guides this project, with the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, the saxophonists J. D. Allen and Andrew Bishop, the pianist Ben Waltzer and the bassist Chris Lightcap. At 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) KRIS DAVIS QUARTET (Sunday night) As on her new album, ''The Slightest Shift'' (Fresh Sound/New Talent), Ms. Davis applies her keyboard playing and compositions to a group consisting of Tony Malaby on tenor saxophone, Eivind Opsvik on bass and Jeff Davis on drums. At 8:30, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $8, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) THE DIPLOMATS (Wednesday) Diplomacy takes on an exuberant character in this experimental trio: the alto saxophonist Rob Brown, the trombonist Steve Swell and the drummer Harris Eisenstadt. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) DAVE DOUGLAS QUINTET (Through Sunday) The trumpeter Dave Douglas always seems on the verge of forming a new band, but this one -- with Uri Caine on piano and Fender Rhodes; James Genus on bass; and Clarence Penn on drums -- has been a solid entity for several years. Here they celebrate a new album, ''Meaning and Mystery'' (Greenleaf), and a valuable new member, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; tonight and tomorrow, $25; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) SCOTT FEINER'S PANDEIRO JAZZ (Tomorrow) Mr. Feiner treats the pandeiro, a tambourinelike Brazilian hand drum, as an expressive jazz instrument; he sets out to prove his point in this ensemble, with the saxophonist Joel Frahm, the guitarist Freddie Bryant and the bassist Doug Weiss.

(Chinen) FLY (Tuesday through May 14) The tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jeff Ballard make up this collaborative trio, which eschews the usual horn-plus-rhythm hierarchy in the service of an elastic group ideal.

(Chinen) KENNY GARRETT QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Garrett is a bulldozer on the alto saxophone, which he applies to blazing post-Coltrane calisthenics; he's also an introspective artisan on the soprano, with which he investigates East Asian folk timbres. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30 and $40 , with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) DAVID GILMORE GROUP (Tomorrow) Mr. Gilmore favors the clean guitar tone of George Benson, but his playing tends more toward an African rhythmic concept and a slippery melodic sense. He works with players equal to the task: Ravi Coltrane on tenor and soprano saxophones, Luis Perdomo on piano, Brad Jones on bass and Terreon Gully on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen) STEFON HARRIS AND KENNY BARRON (Wednesday) Mr. Barron is the leading practitioner of an elegant, economical piano style that thrives in any mainstream setting; Mr. Harris is a firecracker of a vibraphonist with a brightly dynamic style. They should make for fascinating duet partners. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330.; $25. (Chinen) FRED HERSCH AND NANCY KING (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Hersch, the pianist, has worked memorably with the elite jazz vocalists of our era; Ms. King isn't reflexively included in those ranks, but that's certainly through no fault of her own.

At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25.

At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen) MCCOY TYNER TRIO WITH SAVION GLOVER (Tuesday through May 14) The rumbling sweep of Mr. Tyner's piano playing provokes a strong response from Mr. Glover, the paragon of rhythmic tap dance. It also interacts powerfully with the accompaniment of Charnett Moffett on bass and Eric Kamau Gravatt on drums.

Opera * 'LOHENGRIN' (Tomorrow) The revival of Robert Wilson's 1998 production is not the same show that earned the director lusty boos at its premiere. The abstract sets, with luminous bars of white light against a mystical blue backdrop, are as haunting as ever. But this time the singers seem far more comfortable with the glacial movements and stylized hand and arm gestures, which have been simplified. The German tenor Klaus Florian Vogt, in his Met debut appearances, sings the title role, taking over for Ben Heppner. The charismatic soprano Karita Mattila, as Elsa, is in glorious voice. The conductor Philippe Auguin draws pulsing and incisive playing from the Met orchestra. 7:15 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 and $220 tickets remaining.(Anthony Tommasini) 'RIGOLETTO' (Tuesday) Though Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón, the opera world's hottest soprano-tenor couple, have moved on to other things, Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' is still with us at the Met, but with an entirely new cast from the one that sang it earlier this season. Paolo Gavanelli sings the title role, with Norah Amsellem as Gilda and Roberto Aronica as the Duke, Italian opera's most caddish character. Asher Fisch conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175.(Tommasini) * 'TOSCA' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) Deborah Voigt will not be everyone's idea of a Tosca. Her bright and penetrating singing recalls the Nordic sound and temperament of Birgit Nilsson's in the role. But Ms. Voigt invests the character with personal touches, bringing out Tosca's vulnerability, and sings with daring abandon during the intense confrontation with the villainous Scarpia, here the veteran bass James Morris, who sounds terrific. The tenor Franco Farina is an ardent if sometimes bellowing Cavaradossi. (On Thursday, Eduardo Villa takes over for Mr. Farina and Greer Grimsley replaces Mr. Morris.) Carlo Rizzi conducts. Tonight at 8, Monday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205 tonight, with limited availability; sold out Monday; $100 and $175 tickets remaining on Thursday.

(Jeremy Eichler) * IAN BOSTRIDGE AND LEIF OVE ANDSNES (Tomorrow) In a series of EMI recordings together, the British tenor Ian Bostridge and the Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes have proved to be a remarkably eloquent team, and of course, they have done wonders on their own as well. In this joint recital, they share the spotlight, with Mr. Andsnes opening the program with Beethoven's Sonata No. 31 and then joining Mr. Bostridge for a selection of Schubert songs. Mr. Andsnes is also giving a recital -- the same Beethoven sonata, as well as works by Schumann, Mendelssohn and Mussorgsky -- as part of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts series on Sunday afternoon. Mr. Bostridge and Mr. Andsnes perform tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out.

But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. They are performing them all, in chronological order. The fourth of five programs offers Nos. 10, 11 and 12. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60.

At 2 p.m., West Park Presbyterian Church Sanctuary, Amsterdam Avenue between West 86th and 87th Streets, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444; $20; $10 for children under 12; free for children 2 and under. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000.(Glueck) * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. (See above.) (Smith) DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'Stories to Tell: Masterworks from the Kelly Collection of American Illustration,' through May 21. During the Golden Age of Illustration -- the 1880's to the 1930's -- images made by painters for magazines and books captivated the collective American psyche. Original works by some of the best of those artists, including J. C. Leyendecker, N. C. Wyeth and Charles Dana Gibson, are included in this extensive and well-selected exhibition. 580 Madison Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Ken Johnson) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' through May 14. This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Michael Kimmelman) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' (See above.) (Glueck) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500.(Holland Cotter) * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this celebratory exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter) * The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. At the same time, the show is far from didactic. It's beautiful, sexy and, in the case of Raqib Shaw's painting and Kutlug Ataman's video of Sufi meditation, ecstatic. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter) NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman) Galleries: 57th Street * 'Great Pots: The Vessel as Art, 1900 to 2000' This extraordinarily rich and varied lobby show presents 164 works by 143 artists from the Newark Museum's famed ceramics collection. It focuses on utilitarian vessels -- vases, bowls, pots, mugs and platters -- but covers an enormous amount of aesthetic territory, taking in Pueblo Indian, Arts and Crafts, classical Japanese, European Modernist, Pop, funk and much more. The show includes great craftsmen like George Orr, Beatrice Wood, Peter Voulkos and Ron Nagel. The UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through May 19. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo 'The Garden Party' This crowded group show on the theme of the erotic garden looks as if it were produced by a college fraternity for its spring festival. It includes high-profile artists like Vanessa Beecroft, Olafur Eliasson and Yoko Ono. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, near Greene Street, (212) 343-7300, through May 13. (Johnson) Hanna Liden: 'Hairfaces, Scapegoats, Birds, Bloodsuckers, Squareheads & a Few Deaths' A Swedish artist who is in this year's Whitney Biennial, Ms. Liden produces staged color photographs that resemble stills from a low-budget gothic horror movie. With young people in tribal masks menaced by black shrouded figures of death in beautiful wilderness settings, they suggest a meeting of Ingmar Berman and ''The Road Warrior.'' Rivington Arms, 4 East Second Street, East Village, (646) 654-3213, through May 14. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Ed Clark: 'Rebirth' Mr. Clark, who turns 80 on May 6, uses push brooms to sweep great quantities of paint across medium-large canvases, creating bold, suave and sensuous Abstract Expressionist evocations of oceanic flux. G. R. N'Namdi, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 929-6645, through May 11. (Johnson) * Lisa Ruyter: 'I Am a Camera' This painter, known for colorful, photo-based, psychedelic cartoons, takes an exciting turn to black, white and many shades of gray in a series of large, psychologically resonant, finely outlined self-portraits. The nearly 16-foot-wide portrait of the artist, doubled in a mirror against an arboreal background, is a knockout. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219, through May 13. (Johnson) Robert Sholties: 'Evolution' A Pennsylvania postal worker with no formal art training, Mr. Sholties paints intensely detailed fantasy landscapes populated by wild and domestic animals and people who are often in South American costumes. Magical, allegorical and apocalyptic events occur, and themes of religion and ecological disaster are addressed in these visionary pictures. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, through May 13.(Johnson) Davor Vrankic With impressively skillful application of graphite on paper, this Paris-based Croatian artist creates darkly comical images of big-eyed, E.T.-like monsters who appear to be undergoing some terrible psychological suffering. The Proposition, 559 West 22nd Street, (212) 242-0035, through May 13. (Johnson) Other Galleries 'An American Abroad: Sandra Fisher and her School of London Friends' Fisher, who was married to the painter R. B. Kitaj, was an American who lived in London until her death in 1994 at age 47. This show of more than 60 drawings and paintings, mostly portraits or nudes, reveals a modestly talented traditionalist with a deft, painterly touch and a down-to-earth affection for her subjects. Also included are some portraits of Fisher by artists like Frank Auerbach, Avigdor Arikha and Mr. Kitaj. New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-6466, through May 13. (Johnson) Ken Butler: 'Instrumental Desire: Strings Attached' Trained as a classical musician and as a painter, Mr. Butler is a performance artist who produces electronically amplified music on unlikely stringed instruments that he constructs himself out of found objects and parts of real instruments. This jam-packed exhibition presents 79 instruments made from things like a rifle, an old sled, a leaf rake and a metal detector. Sideshow, 319 Bedford Avenue, at South Second Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8180, through May 14. (Johnson) Last Chance * ECHOES FROM THE STEPPES: MONGOLIAN 17TH-, 18TH- AND 19TH-CENTURY BRONZES AND PAINTINGS The bronzes represent the four styles of Mongolian religious sculpture, but the main event is the 77 sakhuis paintings -- small, finely wrought, richly colored portraits of Buddhist priests and protective or wrathful deities that the nomadic Mongols wore, framed in silver, as amulets. E. & J. Frankel, 1040 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 879-5733; closes tomorrow. (Smith) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL' This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400; closes on Monday. (Because of the popularity of the show, museum hours will be extended tomorrow to 8 p.m.) (Glueck) James Harrison: 'The Future is in the Past' Densely worked, visionary paintings and drawings like the ones in this fascinating show have made Harrison (1925-90) a figure of cultlike devotion for certain local artists. Luise Ross, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-2161; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) Gedi Sibony and Josh Smith These cool, dry hipsters provoke a mildly irate perplexity. Mr. Smith roughly paints his own name in large, blocky letters on collages and stretched store-bought fabric. Mr. Sibony has placed sheets of cardboard, plywood, sheetrock and perforated metal around the gallery; removed part of a gallery wall; and covered part of one room with nondescript carpet. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, at Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) Amy Sillman With sensuous verve Ms. Sillman mixes a number of different painterly languages in her appealing but uncertainly focused paintings: Abstract Expressionism, Cubism, Constructivism and primitivistic image-making. Sikkema Jenkins, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)"

Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Broadway * 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day-care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka) * 'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!' This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO' The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell) 'DARK YELLOW' Elias Koteas and Tina Benko star in this compelling one-act psychological thriller about a one-night stand that involves one shocking revelation after another (1:35). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Performances resume on Monday. 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'THE GOLD STANDARD' A successful alumnus, his trophy girlfriend and an eccentric Korean professor form a romantic triangle at a campus bar in Daniel Roberts's drama, which is occasionally original but often downright odd (2:30). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) 'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE A NATURAL DEATH' Melvin Van Peebles's 1971 Tony-nominated musical, ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,'' isn't so much performed at the club T New York, as erupted, like some sort of streetwise lava flow. This early precursor to hip-hop, rap and poetry slams is a get-down, roiling depiction of ghetto life, and we're not talking urbane bling (1:30) T New York, 240 West 52nd Street, (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban) 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'HAM LAKE' A gregarious 20-something man reveals more than he intends to in this 80-minute seriocomic barroom monologue by Sam Rosen and Nat Bennett. Mr. Rosen is a wry and skilled earbender. Huron Club at the SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Hunka) * 'WAITING FOR GODOT' Vladimir (Wendell Pierce) and Estragon (J. Kyle Manzay) wait and wait, but in this version they're soaking wet, their desolate plot being surrounded by water. A familiar play is injected with surprises (2:00). Harlem School for the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 864-4444. (Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Resumes performances on Tuesday at the Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BEAU BRUMMELL' Ian Kelly is funny, engaging and intensely sympathetic as the early-19th-century British fashion plate who spent his last years in exile (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Gates) 'COLUMBINUS' The grim ecosphere of the average American high school is analyzed with sympathy and precision in this new play by Stephen Karam and P J Paparelli, which aims to expose the cultural and personal pathologies that gave rise to the horrific events in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, when two students went on a murderous rampage at Columbine High School, killing a dozen students and a teacher before killing themselves. Well acted and stylishly directed, the play exudes earnestness, and a measure of self-importance, too (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'HAMLET' Theater by the Blind's modest, pared-down production offers an angry, sarcastic prince; an Ophelia who won't stop singing; and a Polonius who actually seems to know what he's saying (2:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Gates) 'HERAKLES VIA PHAEDRA' Making her annual excursion into Greek myth and history, Ellen Stewart presents the labors of Herakles and the tragedies of Theseus with an exhilarating, rough-hewn mix of flamenco, wildly beautiful puppets, acrobatic combat between men and magical beasts and a classical South Indian dance performed with a live snake (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closing on Sunday. (Miriam Horn) 'TROUT STANLEY' Claudia Dey's hysterically funny, deliciously lyrical piece of Canadian Gothic is about strange 30-year-old twin sisters and the mysterious man who arrives, D. H. Lawrence style, to upset the household's delicate balance (1:50). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Gates) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that inspires without being sappy. (Dana Stevens) * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (Scott) 'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott) * 'CAVITE' (No rating, 80 minutes, in English and Tagalog) Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in this gripping, no-budget political thriller shot on the fly with hand-held cameras that scour the teeming streets and squatter shacks of Cavite, a city on the outskirts of Manila. (Stephen Holden) * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Holden) 'THE CULT OF THE SUICIDE BOMBER' (No rating, 96 minutes) An engrossing if intellectually thin made-for-British-television documentary that purports to explain how suicide bombing -- which its narrator, Robert Baer, likens to a ''pathological virus'' -- evolved from a weapon of war into a weapon of terror and, finally in Iraq, a ''weapon of chaos.'' (Dargis) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden) * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis) 'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh uses clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis) * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden) * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis) 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis) 'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. But for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) 'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott) 'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott) 'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil'' the professional wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings.(Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Nathan Lee) * 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis) * '12 AND HOLDING' (R, 94 minutes) This poignant, beautifully acted film, directed by Michael Cuesta (''L.I.E.''), flashes a laser beam on the moment between childhood and adolescence, when unguarded emotions and fantasies still rule, but adult experience beckons. (Holden) 'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis) * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) Film Series B-NOIR (Through June 15) Film Forum's six-week festival of 70 low-budget American thrillers from the 1940's and 50's continues this weekend with two double features. Today and Saturday, the films, both directed by Phil Karlson, are ''Kansas City Confidential'' (1952), about a man framed for an armored-car robbery, and ''The Phenix City Story'' (1955), a docudrama about a corrupt Alabama town. The double feature for Sunday and Monday is ''Man in the Dark'' (1953), about a criminal who loses his memory in experimental brain surgery, and ''D.O.A.'' (1950), in which a poisoned, dying man searches for his killer. Edmond O'Brien stars in both. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10.(Anita Gates) HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL (Through June 22) The Film Society of Lincoln Center sponsors this annual festival. This weekend's features include the New York premieres of ''The Camden 28'' (2006), about early-1970's anti-Vietnam War activists; ''Dreaming Lhasa'' (2005), the adventures of a Tibetan filmmaker from New York; and ''Source'' (2005), a documentary from the Czech Republic about the oil boom in Azerbaijan.. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) STANLEY KUBRICK RETROSPECTIVE (Through July 9) The Museum of the Moving Image's five-week series, which includes all 12 of Kubrick's full-length features, continues with ''Killer's Kiss'' (1955), an indie-style film about a boxer; ''The Killing'' (1956), his acclaimed racetrack heist film; and ''La Ronde'' (1950), Max Ophuls's 1950 Vienna romance ''La Ronde,'' based on the same Arthur Schnitzler novel as Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut.'' 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's weekend series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues this weekend with ''Dersu Uzala'' (1975), his Oscar-winning Soviet-made drama about a hunter's friendship with a Russian military explorer. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FOURTH MOMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Through June 21) This monthlong program of preserved and restored films continues at the Museum of Modern Art. This weekend's features include ''Le Coupable'' (1917), a recently rediscovered French silent about a magistrate's illegitimate son, and two Satyajit Ray films, ''The Coward'' (1965), about a screenwriter and an old love, and ''The Holy Man,'' about a fake guru. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) THE VISION THAT CHANGED CINEMA: MICHELANGELO ANTONIONI (Through June 29) BAMcinématek's tribute to Antonioni continues with screenings of his biggest commercial success, ''Blow-Up'' (1966), starring Vanessa Redgrave and David Hemmings, through Tuesday. Two programs of Antonioni's short films will be shown on Wednesday and Thursday. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * ARCTIC MONKEYS (Wednesday) For nearly a year it's been pretty much impossible to read or even hear anything about this young group from Sheffield, England, without some fervid opinion about whether it is or is not, in fact, the greatest band on the planet. The pros have a decent case: the band's catchy, high-strung songs, with terse, punchy guitar riffs and caustic lyrics about the nightclubbing life, are, at the very least, one of rock's biggest new thrills. Appearing with We Are Scientists, a Brooklyn band playing a similar if less memorable kind of spiky disco-punk. At 6:45 p.m.; Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25. (Ben Sisario) BABY GRAMPS (Tomorrow through Wednesday) With a gray beard the size of small shrubbery, a raspy Popeye voice and manic skills on the steel guitar, Baby Gramps plays a cartoonish variation on the role of hobo troubadour in old-timey songs like ''Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' But where he really shines is in his hilarious and ingenious wordplay, as in his palindrome song (''Go hang a salami -- I'm a lasagna hog''). Tomorrow at 7 p.m.; Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $10. Sunday at 9 p.m., Hank's Saloon, 46 Third Avenue, at Atlantic Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (718) 625-8003; $8 donation. Monday at 7 p.m.; Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; free. Wednesday at 9:45 p.m., Naked Lunch, 17 Thompson Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0828; $10. (Sisario) JAMES BROWN (Tonight) He is the godfather of much more than soul: as the chief architect of funk, James Brown is one of the most influential figures in popular music since Louis Armstrong. He's a great dancer, too. At 8 p.m.; B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $80 in advance, $85 at the door. (Sisario) * CAMILLE (Monday and Tuesday) On her album ''Le Fil'' (Narada), Camille creates an astonishing vocal soundworld in miniature, with playful, brassy parts -- some in French, some in scatlike percussive syllables -- cleverly multitracked over a constant hummed drone. There is an elaborate musical intelligence at work, though the overall effect is simply that of an alluring siren song. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Tuesday at 9:30 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; sold out. (Sisario) * CAT POWER AND THE MEMPHIS RHYTHM BAND (Tonight and tomorrow night) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the burgundy-voiced figure of indie melancholy who performs as Cat Power, recorded in Memphis with a group of veteran soul players. The strutting rhythms, tender guitars and happy horns give her an expressive new vocabulary of sorrows, loves and joys; she hasn't sounded so inspired in years. With Dexter Romweber, who played rockabilly with passion and fury in the Flat Duo Jets. At 8; Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; sold out. (Sisario) GOGOL BORDELLO (Tonight) With an untamed stage persona a bit like Iggy Pop and a bit like a paranoid Kafka protagonist, the singer-contortionist Eugene Hutz leads a cultural mashup of dirty punk, raucous Gypsy music and vaudevillian theatrics. The band has been playing like there's no tomorrow for seven or eight years and shows no signs of slowing down or even taking a breath. With Kultur Shock, Dub Trio and Outernational. At 7:30; Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sisario) JAMES HUNTER (Wednesday) After years honing his style in London pubs, this dapper British singer has emerged with ''People Gonna Talk'' (Go/Rounder), recreating the smooth, slithery R & B of early-1960's American singers like Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and Little Willie John with care and affection. At 7:30 and 10 p.m.; Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500; sold out. (Sisario) McDONALD'S GOSPELFEST (Thursday) This competition and performance series puts amateurs and gospel's biggest stars on the same stage. This year those stars include Donnie McClurkin, the Rev.

These are rare chances to hear the songs from her excellent second album, ''Pretty Little Head,'' which has been in music purgatory since Ms. McKay was dropped by Columbia late last year. At 11:30 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario) NEW CARS, BLONDIE (Tonight) The summer touring season sometimes creates strange allegiances. Todd Rundgren is fronting the New Cars, which features two original members of the Cars. (Another two, including the singer Ric Ocasek, declined to participate, and the bassist Benjamin Orr died six years ago.) Mr. Rundgren fills the role of lead singer pretty well, which, considering his versatility, isn't a surprise. With Blondie, whose 2006 highlights include induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a sexy new song by Debbie Harry in tribute to Lil' Kim. At 7 p.m.; Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000 or (212) 307-7171; $20 to $65.(Sisario) MACEO PARKER (Wednesday and Thursday) As the alto saxophonist for James Brown in his prime funk years and later for George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic, Mr. Parker has an impeccable pedigree and the skills to match.

(Sisario) * RADIOHEAD (Tuesday and Wednesday) It's been three years since the last Radiohead album, and Thom Yorke, its singer, is releasing a solo record next month. Those are sometimes bad signs for a band, but there's nothing to worry about here: on this brief summer tour Radiohead is trying out material for a new album. At 8 p.m.; Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; sold out. (Sisario) SUSHEELA RAMAN (Tuesday) Ms. Raman, born in India and living in London, wanders East and West in her songs, often placing Indian-tinged melodies atop pop-jazz vamps. With Brisa Roché. At 7 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $18.(Jon Pareles) SONIC YOUTH (Tuesday) Conventional wisdom would say that Sonic Youth should have burned out years ago: the band has been treading the same shaggy avant-indie path since the early 1980's, and each of its members has had plenty of other interests to pursue. But since its 2002 album ''Murray Street,'' partly about life after 9/11, Sonic Youth has hit a wonderful new stride, sounding comfortable, focused and invigorated. The band begins a tour for its strong new album, ''Rather Ripped'' (Geffen), at CBGB. At 8 p.m.; 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; sold out. (Sisario) RALPH STANLEY (Wednesday) Ralph Stanley's stark, unflinching ''O Death'' leaped out of the soundtrack of ''O Brother, Where Are Thou?'' and introduced a few million new listeners to a gripping, venerable singer whose songs about sin, temptation and salvation are cornerstones of country music. Leading his own band, Mr. Stanley is more avuncular than apocalyptic, but his songs still have eerie moments. With Tres Chicas, featuring the singers Caitlin Cary, Lynn Blakey and Tonya Lamm. At 7 p.m.; Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, (212) 835-2789; free. (Pareles) STEW (Tomorrow) When he's not leading his band, the Negro Problem, Stew plays quieter, melodic pop songs that free-associate their way through wry situations and extravagant metaphors. At 9:30 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles) STIFF LITTLE FINGERS (Sunday) Before Rancid revived the political fervor and punk and ska momentum of the Clash, Stiff Little Fingers was around to insist that the Clash had the right ideas all along. At 8 p.m.; Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Pareles) ROB THOMAS, JEWEL (Tomorrow) On his solo album ''Something to Be'' (Atlantic), Rob Thomas, the lead singer of Matchbox Twenty, has reinvented himself as a dance-pop wiggler in the George Michael mode. Jewel has already gone through her electronic phase (on her forgettable album ''0304'') and, on her new ''Goodbye Alice in Wonderland'' (Atlantic), returned to her specialty, cooing guitar folk. At 7 p.m.; Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000 or (212) 307-7171; $20 to $65. (Sisario) TILLY AND THE WALL (Wednesday) This Omaha indie-rock band plays smart, tuneful anthems with some rough edges, like many indie-rock bands, but has one truly unusual (and effective) gimmick: its percussion comes from the manic tap-dancing of one of its members, Jamie Williams. With David Dondero. At 8 p.m.; Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14. (Sisario) UNCLE MONK (Tomorrow) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this new acoustic duo, singing tautly written songs -- much like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. At 8 p.m.; with Radio I-Ching (featuring Dee Pop of the Bush Tetras), Johnny Black and others. CB's 313 Gallery, 313 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $8. (Sisario) * RUFUS WAINWRIGHT (Wednesday and Thursday) He might well call it sacred music. With a 40-piece orchestra, Mr. Wainwright performs a track-by-track tribute to Judy Garland's 1961 live album ''Judy at Carnegie Hall,'' from ''The Trolley Song'' to ''Chicago.'' At 8 p.m.; Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out. (Sisario) GRETCHEN WILSON (Thursday) Ms. Wilson arrived two years ago as an unapologetic honky-tonker, and though her second album, ''All Jacked Up'' (Epic), deals with some morning-after complications, her appetites are undiminished. On ''Skoal Ring'' she identifies her preferred flavor of man by his chewing tobacco: ''That berry blend on his lips still turns me on.'' At 8 p.m.; Radio City Music Hall, (212) 247-4777; $46.50 to $96.50. (Sisario) 'ZAPPA PLAYS ZAPPA' (Monday) More than a decade after his death, Frank Zappa's transformation from rock composer to composer, period, seems about as complete as it can be. His vast output -- more than 60 albums -- is a repertory to be engaged and interpreted again and again, and for this tour, his son Dweezil is playing his music with a roster that includes the former Zappa employees Steve Vai, Napoleon Murphy Brock and Terry Bozzio. At 8 p.m.; Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $39.50 to $85. (Sisario) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden) ANDREA MARCOVICCI (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Marcovicci's new show, ''Just Love by Request'' is a kind of living room musicale that's one-half pre-set and one-half determined by audience suggestions. The singer's charm rules this unruly format. At 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30; Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $60 cover Tuesday through Thursday, $65 tonight and tomorrow; $60 prix-fixe dinner required for 9 p.m. shows; otherwise, a $20 minimum. (Holden) James Naughton (Tonight and tomorrow) His show is a personal history of cool that connects the crooning of Billy Eckstine and Joe Williams with early doo-wop sounds and the worlds of Tom Waits and Randy Newman. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095; $60, with a $40 minimum.

TOSHIKO AKIYOSHI: A LADIES SALUTE TO A PIONEER (Thursday) Ms. Akiyoshi is an accomplished composer, arranger and pianist, though not originally in that order: it was her pianism that brought her first into the spotlight, and then into the United States, some 50 years ago. She plays on and presides over this concert, which features a pair of pianists now following in her footsteps, Hiromi Uehara (known as Hiromi) and Tomoko Ohno, as well as the venerable tenor saxophonist and flutist Frank Wess. At 8 p.m.; Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, 695 Park Avenue, at East 68th Street, (212) 772-4448; $45. JVC Jazz Festival.(Nate Chinen) GREGG AUGUST SEXTET (Thursday) With his album ''Late August'' (Iacuessa), Mr. August, a bassist, proves himself a sensible small-group composer in the Cedar Walton vein; his band includes the saxophonists Greg Tardy and Myron Walden, the trumpeter John Bailey, the pianist Luis Perdomo and the drummer E. J. Strickland. At 9 p.m., 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.; Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662; no cover.

JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) JOHN HOLLENBECK'S CLAUDIA QUINTET (Tomorrow) This ensemble mounts a texturally oriented and often contrapuntal exploration; Mr. Hollenbeck's drumming is one color on a palette that also includes Chris Speed's clarinet and tenor saxophone, Ted Reichman's accordion and Matt Moran's vibraphone. At 8 p.m.; Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, www.schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12. (Chinen) AVISHAI COHEN TRIO/GROOVE COLLECTIVE/JACOB FRED JAZZ ODYSSEY (Thursday) Three species of pulse are represented on this bill, none greater than the others. Mr. Cohen, the bassist, leads his regular trio, with the keyboardist Sam Barsh and the drummer Mark Guiliana; their new album, ''Continuo'' (Razdaz), confirms their gift for cohesive drama. Groove Collective and Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey seek more straightforward fusions, respectively streetwise and spacey. At 8 p.m.; Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at East 15th Street, (212) 307-7171; $25. JVC Jazz Festival.

(Chinen) * ANDREW HILL TRIO (Thursday) With ''Time Lines'' (Blue Note), Mr. Hill delivered what is likely to be regarded as one of this year's best recordings, and perhaps one of the strongest of his distinguished career. Performing with the album's core personnel, John Hebert on bass and Eric McPherson on drums, he uses mysterious harmonies and an elliptical sense of time. At 7:30 p.m.; Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500; $20 at the door, $15 advance, $12 for members. JVC Jazz Festival.

At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25 and $30. (Chinen) DANIEL LEVIN QUARTET/FRED LONBERG-HOLM TRIO (Wednesday) Mr. Levin, a cellist, makes music full of pregnant pauses and gradual crescendos; celebrating the release of an album on Hat Hut Records, he works with his preferred instrumentation of trumpet (Nate Wooley), vibraphone (Matt Moran) and bass (Joe Morris). Mr. Lonberg-Holm, another cellist, plays a later set with a pair of veteran collaborators, the saxophonist Michaël Attias and the keyboardist Anthony Coleman.

(Chinen) JASON MORAN AND URI CAINE (Monday) Duets and solos by a pair of pianists who share affinities for emphatic articulation, tumbling rhythms, two-handed polyphony and conceptual experimentation.

(Chinen) GARY PEACOCK, PAUL MOTIAN, MARC COPLAND (Wednesday through June 10) Mr. Peacock, a bassist, and Mr. Motian, a drummer, have worked together in a handful of superb rhythm sections over the years, most famously with the pianist Keith Jarrett.

(Chinen) THE PHILADELPHIA STORY (Tuesday through June 18) Hard bop is the predominant sound of jazz in Philadelphia, and it will most likely serve as a common language for this all-star band, featuring five of that city's highly regarded native sons: the trumpeter Randy Brecker, the tenor saxophonist and flutist Lew Tabackin, the pianist Eric Reed, the bassist Dwayne Burno and the drummer Byron Landham. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays; Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) CHRIS POTTER TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Potter is among the small number of tenor saxophonists to have absorbed both Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane and emerged sounding like his own man. He appears here in the setting that both predecessors helped popularize, backed only by bass (Scott Colley) and drums (Jeff Ballard). At 10 p.m.; 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10.

(Bernard Holland) HAROLYN BLACKWELL (Wednesday) ''Landmark American Songs in a Great American Landmark,'' the epithet of a program officially titled ''Give My Regards,'' just about sums it up: this soprano offers tunes, classics of cabaret rather than de facto classics, by Gershwin, Cole Porter and their ilk.

There will be the New York premiere of Andrew Imbrie's Symphony No. 2, composed in 1970. Mr. Imbrie, celebrating his 85th birthday this year, writes works that mostly hew to formal classical structures, but speak in a gritty, astringent and arresting modern language. The Riverside Symphony has long championed this original composer's music. George Rothman, the music director, will also conduct the United States premiere of the Symphony No. 2 by the little-heard Danish composer Niels Gade, who worked under Mendelssohn at Leipzig in his youth and became an influential figure in Scandinavia in the late 19th century. Pairing this work with Grieg's ever-popular piano concerto makes sense. The pianist Terrence Wilson is the soloist. At 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 and $45.

Ms. Steinbacher has come far since she entered the Munich Conservatory at 9, the youngest student in its history. She has played concertos in Europe with the conductors Neville Marriner, Valery Gergiev and Yuri Temirkanov, and this spring made her American debut in California on tour with Kurt Masur and the London Symphony. But this recital, with the pianist Robert Kulek, will be her New York debut. The program includes works by Grieg, Schnittke, Brahms and Ravel. At 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 707-8787; free, but tickets are required. (Tickets are distributed starting at noon on the day of concert.)

(La Rocco) '4-ISH' (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This Dutch company presents ''4-ISH,'' a show that might be called hip-hop but is really hip-hop-ish and involves many kinds of urban derring-do, including quarter pipes (as in skateboarding), kung fu, electrified skate wheels and a live D.J. With a postshow dance party for teenagers tomorrow. Tonight and Thursday at 7 p.m., tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200, newvictory.org; $10 to $30. (Erika Kinetz) MIGUEL GUTIERREZ AND THE POWERFUL PEOPLE (Tonight and tomorrow) A rare second chance in the world of downtown dance to catch a thoughtful and compelling work.

(La Rocco) MYUNG SOO KIM DANCE PROJECT (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Kim, who channels ancient Korean shamanistic rituals through modern dance, will perform six solos in costumes inspired by vivid Korean traditional dress. (Through June 18.) At 8 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200 or telecharge.com; $35, $25 for students and 65+.

(Rockwell) * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tonight through Sunday; Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, is settling into the intimate Theater 80 through July 30. Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45.(Rockwell) Out Like That! Festival (Tonight and tomorrow) The Bronx Academy of Art and Dance continues its sixth annual summer festival for gay choreographers with Michael Leleux and Donnette Heath, the guest vocalist Nadia Ackerman and the visual artist Dan Price. Jule Ramirez and her troupe of young poets round out what will no doubt be a cozy, raucous performance. At 8 p.m., 841 Barretto Street, South Bronx, (718) 842-5223; $15. (LaRocco) MICHAEL PORTNOY (Tonight and tomorrow) In these politically correct times, we've apparently been reduced to making fun of mythical communities, as the choreographer Michael Portnoy and a diverse mix of performers do in ''The K Sound.'' The cast includes a diva-wizard who could be worth the price of admission all by her (his?) lonesome. At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 11; $12. (La Rocco) * ROD RODGERS DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) The company will present four programs, beginning with dances by its director, Kim Grier, and a retrospective of dances by Rodgers (tonight and tomorrow night), a program of dances by Martha Tornay and Nicole Wolcott performed by the East Village Dance Project (tomorrow afternoon) and a concert by the Rodgers Youth Program (Sunday afternoon).

(Dunning) NINA WINTHROP AND DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Winthrop will present her multimedia ''That's Me -- I'm the One Lying Down Over There,'' set to music by Jon Gibson.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery, and the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500.(Nicolai Ouroussoff) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) * MET: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. History is full of shifty characters, antique visionaries, cusp figures and half-crazy oddball innovators, later overlooked because they're hard to pigeonhole. Their independent cast of mind is the truest expression of how civilization advances. (See above.) (Kimmelman) 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN' Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. Museum of Arts & Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, through Sept. 3. (Smith) Museum of Modern Art : 'AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION,' through July 10. The latest collection assembled by the Museum of Modern Art bolsters its holdings of art world mavericks like Philip Guston, Jennifer Bartlett, Ken Price and Vija Celmins and includes first-timers like Robert Grosvenor, John Lees and Susana Solano. It also illuminates parts of the untold, or forgotten, stories of the art of the 1970's and 80's: the achievements of painters and sculptors who were not at the forefront of Post-Minimalism, photo appropriation or Neo-Expressionism. Some of their efforts may disappear into storage, but quite a few will shake up the Modern's conception of the complicated course of art since 1970. The Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) National Academy: '181st Annual: an Invitational Exhibition of Contemporary Art' This year's sprawling hodgepodge of an invitational presents works by 124 artists ranging from tightly focused realist painting to politically charged video installation. National Academy, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880. Through June 13. (Ken Johnson) New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Holland Cotter) Galleries: Uptown Peter Dayton: 'Surfboards by Clement Greenberg' For a witty spin on commodity-critique art, Mr. Dayton creates panel paintings combining the glossy surfaces, colorful banding and logos of surfboard design and the striped patterns of paintings by Kenneth Noland and Barnett Newman that were favored by the powerful formalist critic Clement Greenberg. Winston Wächter, 39 East 78th Street, (212) 327-2526, through June 24. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street 'Coup de Foudre' Four works loosely related by the metaphor of lightning. Emilie Halpern offers a white plastic lightning bolt and walls papered by heat-sensitive film. Small cutouts by Tim Noble & Sue Webster cast pornographic shadows; stick-on letters applied to the floor, walls and ceiling by Tamara Sussman spell out an erotic fantasy written in Web-based ''slash fiction'' style; and a surprisingly affecting, grainy, rambling video created by Enid Baxter Blader with a homemade camera explores stormy natural and emotional weather. Tina Kim, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 716-1100, through June 23. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING' This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck) * THOMAS ZIPP: URANLICHT An impressive solo debut pairs dark, nearly abstract landscapes and cursory botanical imagery with appropriated images of authoritarian bearded men, evoking a by-gone avant-garde and the reaction against it. A room-filling hand-built organ that Père Ubu might have loved completes the presentation. HarrisLieberman, 89 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290, through June 17. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea * 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson) * Mamma Andersson: 'Rooms Under the Influence' In haunting paintings of rooms and landscapes, this Swedish painter combines the sensuousness of Edouard Vuillard and the moody angst of Edvard Munch. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, through June 17. (Johnson) Willem de Kooning: 'Sketchbook' Twelve pages bearing spidery pencil drawings from a rare, intact sketchbook from the mid-1970's by this great Abstract Expressionist. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, through June 17. (Johnson) * NICOLE EISENMAN: 'PROGRESS: REAL & IMAGINED' This show is dominated by two mural-sized paintings of elaborately imagined, demonically energetic panoramas. One examines the artist's dilemma; the other takes a distinctly ahistorical view of life. But both represent real progress in Ms. Eisenman's determined struggle to flesh out her narrative style with color and texture, and a room of small paintings shows even more promise. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, (212) 334-9304, through June 17. (Smith) Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe If you know Mr. Gilbert-Rolfe only for his formidably cerebral art criticism (among other achievements, he is co-founder of the journal October), you may be surprised by his paintings. His four square canvases combining Color Field painting and vertical passages of grid painting appeal far more to sensory than to intellectual experience. Gray Kapernekas, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 462-4150, through June 17. (Johnson) 'Invisible Might: Works from 1965-1971' This luminous group show about the euphoric convergence of Minimalism and new technologies in the late 60's and early 70's includes a smoky glass cube by Larry Bell; a solid black plastic cube by John McCracken; a tall, clear acrylic prism by Robert Irwin; a beautiful aqua green light projection by James Turrell; a yellow molded plastic relief by Craig Kauffman; and a corner composition of elastic cords and bent metal rods by Fred Sandback. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212) 995-1785, through June 24. (Johnson) RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith) Last Chance * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) Museum of the City of New York: Sherril Schell: 'Unknown Modernist,' Though little known today, the photographer Sherril Schell (1877-1964) was critically recognized in the 1930's for his severely formalist photographs of New York architecture. This small exhibition presents 15 examples in which closely cropped views of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and other monuments of Manhattan emphasize compositional order, structure, pattern, light and shadow. Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672; closes on Tuesday. (Johnson)"

Bush's press secretary, he has begun to learn them. For instance, at some point in virtually every televised press briefing, a middle-aged man named Raghubir Goyal, who is The India Globe's Washington correspondent, will thrust his arm anxiously into the air, be called on and deliver a rambling monologue about the perfidies of Pakistan in general and Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, in particular. And a man named Lester Kinsolving, a radio host and reporter for a Baltimore station with a big grin and game-show-host wavy hair, will interrupt a back-and-forth on, say, the operational capacities of Al Qaeda to read confounding questions he has written out, word for word, before the press briefing began."

In remarks lasting just two minutes, she spoke bluntly: The ''authorization to use force has run its course, and it is time to reverse the failed policies of President Bush and to end this war as soon as possible.'' She added, ''If the president will not bring himself to accept reality, it is time for Congress to bring reality to him.''"

The occasion was the Warrens' three-day H.I.V./AIDS conference, ''Disturbing Voices.'' When Jim Towey, the director of the Bush administration's Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, walked in, Ross acknowledged him and noted that Towey had been the longtime lawyer for Mother Teresa.

The results give Hamas the right to form the next government, ending more than 40 years of domination by Fatah. A1 Hamas's victory threw President Bush and his aides on the defensive, complicating the administration's policy of trying to promote democracy as an antidote to the spread of terrorism in the Arab world. Mr. Bush said the results spoke to the failures of the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, to root out corruption, not to any flaws in the Bush administration's policy. A11 The elections were met with a mixture of jubilation and consternation in much of the Arab world, and for some it raised the concern that, in winning, Hamas would almost certainly have to change. A11 European leaders, whose countries are major financial donors to the Palestinian Authority, registered disquiet verging on hostility toward Hamas's triumph. A11 Strife at World Economic Forum A magazine article calling on nations to boycott Israel because of its treatment of Palestinians has provoked a tempest at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, prompting the organizers to pull the magazine from its shelves and issue an apology. A11 U.S. and China Back Plan for Iran President Bush and the Chinese government both declared their full support for a Russian proposal to allow Iran to run civilian nuclear facilities as long as Russia and international nuclear inspectors are in full control of the fuel. A3 Unmet Pledges to Rebuild Iraq Because of unforeseen security costs, haphazard planning and shifting priorities, the American-financed reconstruction program in Iraq will not complete scores of projects that were promised to help rebuild the country, a federal oversight agency reported. A8 The American military said it had released five Iraqi women, half those held in its prisons, but said the release had been previously scheduled and was unrelated to demands made by the kidnappers of the American journalist Jill Carroll. A8 More Energy Woes for Georgia Energy shortages struck Georgia anew as a wind storm toppled a major power transmission line and Russia's gas monopoly failed to restore the flow of natural gas to the country after pipelines were sabotaged last weekend, energy officials said. A4 Groups Protest U.N. Proposal Human rights organizations and the Congressional Human Rights Caucus protested a decision by the United States to back a measure introduced by Iran denying two international gay rights groups a voice at the United Nations. A4 NATIONAL A14-21 Poll Finds Mixed Support For Domestic Spy Program Americans are willing to tolerate eavesdropping without warrants to fight terrorism, but are concerned that the aggressive antiterrorism programs championed by the Bush administration are encroaching on civil liberties, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. A1 President Bush declared again that his administration's program for eavesdropping without warrants was well within existing law, and said efforts in Congress to write legislation expressly giving him authority for such a program were unnecessary and dangerous. A20 Lobbyist Inquiry Takes a Turn The investigation into Jack Abramoff, the disgraced Republican lobbyist, took a new turn when the Justice Department said the chief prosecutor in the inquiry would step down next week because he had been nominated to a federal judgeship by President Bush.

3732,,The Huckabee Factor,http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E1DE1F30F935A25751C1A9619C8B63,"Mike Huckabee walked into the lobby of the Des Moines Marriott at 5:30 a.m. on Dec. 3, deposited an armful of dirty laundry at the desk and checked to make sure he was being credited with Marriott Rewards points toward his next stay. Then, accompanied by his wife, Janet, his daughter, Sarah, and his press secretary, Alice Stewart -- who doubles as his Boston Marathon trainer -- he walked into the dark, freezing morning, climbed into a waiting S.U.V. and headed for Central College in Pella, Iowa. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, was in a buoyant mood on three hours of sleep. The night before, his commercial flight suffered a long Chicago holdover on the way from Boston, but he had reason to hope that his days at the mercy of the airlines might be numbered. A Des Moines Register opinion poll had just shown Huckabee passing Mitt Romney to take the lead in the run-up to the Jan. 3 caucus. His picture, he already knew, was on the front page of that morning's USA Today. Now he was headed to Central College, to appear, surrounded by enthusiastic students, on ''The Early Show'' on CBS. This kind of momentum, he hoped, would finally produce enough cash to allow him to charter his own plane. The governor was especially happy that morning about an impending endorsement he expected (and received the following day) from Tim LaHaye, the author of the apocalyptic ''Left Behind'' series of novels. ''Left Behind'' is wildly popular among evangelicals, who have bought more than 65 million copies, making LaHaye a very rich man and one of the few writers who is also a major philanthropist. Recently he donated a hockey rink to Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, although some members of the faculty there deride ''Left Behind'' as science fiction. Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, has no such reservations. He considers the ''Left Behind'' books, in which the world comes to a violent end as Jesus triumphs over Satan, a ''compelling story written for nontheologians.''"

A1 The Army has decided to reimburse a Halliburton subsidiary for nearly all of its costs on a disputed $2.41 billion no-bid contract to deliver fuel and repair oil equipment in Iraq, even though the Pentagon's own auditors identified more than $250 million in charges as potentially excessive or unjustified.

A1 New Form of Computer Hacking In some countries, past forms of computer hacking have been eclipsed by an even more virulent form of electronic con: the use of simple keylogging software that can infect computers, silently copy the keystrokes of their users and send that information to cybercriminals. A1 Labor Leaders Gather The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s leaders will gather in San Diego and will once again be on the defensive, a situation made worse by the split the labor federation suffered last year. Wages for the nation's workers failed to keep up with inflation, while unions in the automobile, steel and airline industries are battling management's efforts to cut wages and benefits. A10 Concern About National Guard Governors of both parties complained that Bush administration policies were stripping the National Guard of equipment and personnel needed to respond to hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, forest fires and other emergencies. Tens of thousands of National Guard members have been sent to Iraq. A10 Impending Rail Fee for States After failing in a three-year effort to hand over Amtrak's Washington-to-Boston tracks to a new federal-state consortium, the Bush administration is seeking tens of millions of dollars in extra payments from the states for use of the tracks by commuter railroads serving the route. But the states are complaining that they already have contracts that specify what they should pay.

Now, with another hotel scheduled to open this month at the airport, she is worried. ''Within a five-mile radius there will be almost 900 rooms,'' Ms. Sullivan said, including a La Quinta Inn and Suites, which is scheduled to open late this month. ''It's crazy. The demand in the city has gone up tremendously, but we haven't seen that growth. And our supply is larger than the growth. Now you are spreading whatever growth there is into six properties, so it is hard to measure growth because every year another hotel opens up.''"

Akinola of Nigeria, a man whose reputation has been built on his stance against homosexuality and who has created an offshoot of his Nigerian church in North America, has become the spiritual head of 21 conservative churches in the United States. The churches opted to leave the Episcopal Church over its decision to consecrate a gay bishop and allow churches to bless same-sex unions.

Now Paul asks for more of Brad's help. Meanwhile, as if Alan Shore (James Spader) doesn't have enough problems, his secretary (Marisa Coughlan) is arrested for tax evasion. 10 P.M. (FX) THE SHIELD -- ''Of Mice and Lem.'' Vic (Michael Chiklis) may be a corrupt cop, but he tries to take care of his people. Concerned about Lem (Kenneth Johnson) being safe in prison, he makes a deal with the Devil, so to speak, to protect him. 10 P.M. (USA) NASHVILLE STAR -- Season premiere. As the title pretty much spells out, this is a show in which would be country music singers compete. Wynonna Judd (right) and Cowboy Troy are the hosts.

A1 The Kurdish prison population in northeastern Iraq has swelled to include at least several hundred suspected insurgents, but the Kurdish regional government does not yet have a policy or legal system to review their cases, a situation that led to a prison strike this month. A12 Checkpoint Removal in Gaza Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, left, acting on a pledge to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, approved the removal of more than two dozen checkpoints in the West Bank and agreed to improve the flow of goods in and out of Gaza. A8 Ethiopian Attack in Mogadishu An Ethiopian fighter jet strafed the Mogadishu airport in a show of force that took the conflict between Somalia's provisional government and Islamist movement to the capital for the first time in nearly a week of fighting. The Islamists have retreated from at least two towns. A14 Affluent Bolivians Defy Morales President Evo Morales of Bolivia's agenda has encountered intense resistance in the country's affluent lowlands, where pressure for more political autonomy and a greater share of the nation's natural gas revenues has become the most pressing challenge to his government. A3 Chile May Reform Pension Plan The Chilean government has recommended that the country's privatized pension system be supplanted by one in which the state plays a larger role. The proposed changes include a minimum pension for the country's poorest citizens. A18 Battle of the Sexes in France The contest for the French presidency, the first one in which a major party has nominated a woman, is shaping up to be one of competing male-female images: Ségolène Royal, the Socialist, has portrayed herself as a mother-protector while characterizing her expected opponent, Nicolas Sarkozy, as a Darwinian male. A10 Bosnian War Criminal Tracked Details are emerging in a Belgrade courtroom of how the former commander of the Bosnian Serb army, Gen. Ratko Mladic, wanted for the most heinous crimes of Bosnia's bloody civil war from 1992 to 1995, has managed to elude thousands of Western peacekeepers and Belgrade police forces for 11 years. A16 NATIONAL A22-33 Bipartisan Effort in Works To Draft Immigration Bill Counting on the support of the new Democratic majority in Congress, Democratic lawmakers and their Republican allies are working on measures that could place millions of illegal immigrants on a more direct path to citizenship than would a bill that the Senate passed in the spring. A1 Some See No Change in Bush After the beating his party took in November, President Bush indicated that he had received the message that voters wanted change, and that he would serve some up fast. But in the last two weeks, the critics and even some allies say, they have seen a reversal. A24 Blacks Struggle to Find Nannies As more blacks move up the economic ladder, one fixture -- some would say necessity -- of the upper-middle-class income bracket often eludes them. Like hailing a cab in Midtown Manhattan, searching for a nanny can be an exasperating, humiliating exercise for many blacks, the kind of ordeal that makes them wonder aloud what year it is. A1 Ex-Tenants Fight for Projects The heritage of suspicion and misery separating New Orleans's poorest residents from its comfortable classes is playing out in a fierce battle over the future of the public housing projects there, a fight in which the shelter of as many as 20,000 people is at stake. A22 Faith Consultant Raises Votes Democratic Party strategists and nonpartisan pollsters credit Mara Vanderslice and her 2-year-old consulting firm, Common Good Strategies, with helping a handful of Democratic candidates make deep inroads among white evangelical and churchgoing Roman Catholic voters in Kansas, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. But some in the party are not pleased. A22 New Drunken-Driving Tactic The Police Department of Bennington, Vt., has distributed to local bars and restaurants 200 pint glasses bearing three of its logos. ''It's about alcohol awareness, trying to get people to drink responsibly and not drink and drive,'' said Lt. Paul Doucette of the department. ''When they see the police logo, maybe they'll stop and think.'' A33 OBITUARIES B6-7 James Brown The singer, songwriter, bandleader and dancer who indelibly transformed 20th-century music, selling millions of records in a career that lasted half a century, he was 73. A1 Frank Stanton A central figure in the development of television broadcasting in the United States and the industry's most articulate and persuasive spokesman during his nearly three decades as president of CBS, he was 98. A1 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Diabetics in the Workplace Confront a Tangle of Laws While the number of diabetics in America continues to rise, experts say the disease is on its way to becoming a conspicuous fact of life in the nation's labor force, raising all sorts of issues for workers and managers. A1 Reclassified Homicides Rise For reasons that no one can quite explain, ''reclassified'' homicides, deaths linked to injuries incurred in months or years past, reached a record number in New York City this year. In all, 35 deaths in the city this year have been linked to wounds incurred as long as 30 years ago. That is roughly three times the historical average, and 14 more than the year before. B1 Mayor Asks Kuwait for Aid Mayor Lawrence G. Chiaravallo, of Lake Como, N.J., conducted international relations on behalf of this town of 1,800 people. He asked Kuwaiti envoys to finance a new police station, a fire department and a judge's chambers at a cost of $3.7 million. Some are displeased that Mr. Chiaravallo kept his project quiet. B1 Neediest Cases B4 SCIENCE TIMES F1-8 Fossils of New Dinosaur Giant Fossils of a giant dinosaur have been uncovered in Spain, and they appear to be remains of the largest terrestrial animal known to have lived in Europe, paleontologists reported. F4 Alcohol and Head Trauma A new report suggests that, when it comes to serious head injuries people who have drunk moderate amounts of alcohol seem to be at less risk of dying than people who are sober. F7 Health & Fitness F5 SPORTSTUESDAY D1-8 Older Skiers Testing the Limits Rigorous specialty ski and snowboarding camps -- mini-boot camps that promise improved skills -- have become a popular adjunct to the conventional one-hour, private ski-school lesson. The majority of students are 45 to 65 years old, baby boomers who want to ski what would give others a fright. D1 ARTS E1-12 Books on the Beatles Beatles-obsessed authors whose books are rejected by mainstream publishers are still finding audiences for their books by publishing them themselves. Many of these self-published books are lavishly produced and packed with original research that makes them invaluable to Beatles scholars and collectors, and some have been startlingly successful through online sales. E1 BUSINESS DAY C1-7 State of the U.S. Economy Economists have been describing the economy as not too hot, not too cold; but the housing market and the auto industry have fallen into a deep freeze. Yet on several other fronts, including commercial construction and high-end consumer spending, economic activity appears to be sizzling. C1 Christmas Sales Fall Short Shoppers mobbed suburban malls over the holiday weekend, but the final burst of buying is expected to fall short of retailers' expectations. Industry analysts said that, after a strong, discount-induced start the day after Thanksgiving, consumer spending slowed in December and never fully recovered.

(NBC) CONVICTION -- Dick Wolf, creator of the ''Law & Order'' empire, introduces a drama series about glamorous young lawyers in the district attorney's office. In the premiere episode, a drug dealer cuts open a woman's abdomen to retrieve the drugs she smuggled for him; one inexperienced lawyer on her first trial cleverly leaves the evidence unguarded; and another blithely tells a stranger where his boss is having dinner, information that leads to a fatal shooting. That's Stephanie March (above) as Alexandra Cabot, a character who has transferred here from ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.'' 8 P.M. (Encore) ANNIE HALL (1977). Woody Allen's best-picture Oscar winner stars Mr. Allen as Alvy Singer, the quintessential New York neurotic, and Diane Keaton as the eccentrically dressed, adorably ditsy Midwestern young woman that he loves. The film took home three more Oscars -- for best director, actress and screenplay (Mr. Allen and Marshall Brickman). 8 P.M. (5) N.A.A.C.P. IMAGE AWARDS -- ''Crash,'' the drama about race relations in Los Angeles, is the movie with the most nominations. ''Grey's Anatomy,'' ''Everybody Hates Chris'' and ''The Bernie Mac Show'' are among the nominated television series. The show also honors achievement in music (Carlos Santana, above, will be inducted into the hall of fame) and literature. Cuba Gooding Jr. is host. 9 P.M. (NBC) LAS VEGAS -- A woman finds a finger in the casino's new buffet. But there's a chance, as in a similar real-life case, that it was planted. And rather than suing the casino, the woman makes another, more personal demand. It involves Danny (Josh Duhamel). 10 P.M. (USA) MONK -- Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive detective, suspects an astronaut of murder. 10 P.M. (CBS) NUMB3RS -- An antiwar-protest bombing looks like the work of a 1970's activist who went underground (or at least dropped out of sight) roughly 30 years ago. 10 P.M. (Sundance) IN SHORT: ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING SHORTS -- Five of them. ''The Wrong Trousers'' and ''A Close Shave'' are Wallace and Gromit animated films from Nick Park (shown at Cannes with a statue of Gromit). ''Ryan'' is Chris Landreth's portrait of an artist turned panhandler. ''Wasp'' is about a working-class British single mother of four. And ''Harvie Krumpet'' is about a home-schooled Polish boy with Tourette's syndrome. ANITA GATES"

(ABC) SUPERNANNY -- Jo Frost (left), the amazing British nanny who has turned devil children into angels, is back -- and none too soon for her client of the week. Cheryl Carsley is a divorced mother of five (ages 4 to 7), including two sets of twins. While she recovers from a difficult divorce and trains for a teaching career, her children repeatedly hit her and scream at her. 9 P.M. (ABC Family) BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE -- Season premiere. In the first season, Lynn Kerr (Daphne Zuniga) moved to New York with her two daughters. Sophie (Sarah Foret) had a scholarship to a prestigious private school. And Karen (Torrey DeVitto) was an aspiring model. Now the girls' father (Grant Show, Ms. Zuniga's old ''Melrose Place'' costar) enters the picture. He wants custody of Sophie. 9 P.M. (CBS) TWO AND A HALF MEN -- Young Jake (Angus T. Jones) is having a birthday party. His father, Alan (Jon Cryer), doesn't want his sexy 22-year-old girlfriend to attend. Of course, the fact that Alan has a sexy 22-year-old girlfriend negates the whole premise of the series. 9 P.M. (Lifetime) DOUBLE CROSS -- Two desperate housewives (Yancy Butler, right, and Barbara Niven) jokingly agree to murder each other's husbands. But maybe one of them isn't kidding. Farley Granger could have predicted that. (See ''Strangers on a Train,'' Alfred Hitchcock, 1951.) 9 P.M. (NBC) THE APPRENTICE -- Task No. 2 for Donald Trump's would-be protégés: Get New Yorkers to do a lot of textmessaging on their cellphones. 10 P.M. (ABC) MIRACLE WORKERS -- Series premiere. A 34-year-old man who has been blind since childhood may see again, thanks to stem-cell treatment. And a 47-year-old woman with degenerative bone and joint disease may be able to kiss her wheelchair and walker goodbye, after cutting-edge spinal surgery. Maybe medicine shouldn't descend to the makeover genre, but these are life-changing opportunities for the lucky few. 2 A.M. (FX) HURLYBURLY -- (1998). It's far too late to see the original Broadway production of David Rabe's play about misanthropes in Hollywood. Or the New Group's highly praised 2005 revival with Ethan Hawke. But the film version, with (above, from left) Kevin Spacey, Anna Paquin and Sean Penn, lives on. Just try to ignore Meg Ryan, trying her best to look damaged. ANITA GATES"

(Sci Fi) DARK KINGDOM: THE DRAGON KING -- It's Wagner's ''Ring Cycle'' without the singing. It's ''The Lord of the Rings'' without the hobbits. This two-part television movie tells the epic story of a young blacksmith, Siegfried (Benno Fürmann, above right, with Max von Sydow as Eyvind), who slays a dragon (in this case an impressive computer-generated one) and falls in love with the Queen of Iceland (Kristanna Loken), an early supermodel type. Part 1 of 2. 8 P.M. (5) PRISON BREAK -- Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) spent the first season getting into Fox River State Penitentiary so he could help his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), an innocent man on death row, escape. But the breakout failed. This is Lincoln's execution day. The vice president (Patricia Wettig, formerly of ''Thirtysomething''), who may have gotten Lincoln where he is today, continues to be evil. 9 P.M. (13, 49) EUGENE O'NEILL -- This ''American Experience'' documentary from Ric Burns looks at the life and work of O'Neill (1888-1953), the Nobel Prize-winning playwright who was the author of ''The Iceman Cometh,'' ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' and ''A Moon for the Misbegotten.'' (The photograph above was taken in 1936.) Al Pacino, Jason Robards, Liam Neeson, Christopher Plummer, Tony Kushner, John Guare and Zoe Caldwell comment or perform. 9 P.M. (5) 24 -- ''Day 5: 9 P.M.-10 P.M.'' The terrorists decide to add a few hundred thousand civilians to their hit list. Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), counterterrorist hero, does the unthinkable. 9 P.M. (ABC) SUPERNANNY -- Jo Frost's challenge tonight is the Young family. The 13-year-old boy is fine, but his 5-year-old brother and 3-year-old sister are literally climbing the walls. 9 P.M. (History) DIGGING FOR THE TRUTH -- While the world waits for the British judge's decision in Dan Brown and Random House U.K.'s ''Da Vinci Code'' trial (the authors of ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'' are suing because, they say, Mr. Brown stole their concept: that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, had children and now has descendants living in France), Josh Bernstein (above) does some DNA testing to try to determine if there is any truth to the books' premise. 9:30 P.M.

It's down to the last two deliberately mismatched couples. Brittany (right), who works at a tanning salon, is teamed with Joe, a speedchess champion who majored in philosophy. Cher, a beer spokesmodel and former Hooters waitress, is with Josh, a museum critic who suffers from panic attacks. They'll be tested to see how much they've learned. 7:30 P.M . (21) BARRY MANILOW: MUSIC AND PASSION -- Mr. Manilow's concert special seems to be all about oldies. He'll do ''I Write the Songs,'' ''Copacabana'' and ''Mandy,'' plus numbers from his new album, ''Manilow: Greatest Songs of the 50's.'' 9 P.M. (CBS) CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION -- ''I Like to Watch.'' Grissom (William Petersen) and the team are chosen to be part of a reality series. This means a camera crew follows them around while they try to solve the murder of an affluent real-estate agent found dead in her high-rise apartment. 9 P.M. (5) THE O.C. -- Life is hard for gorgeous young people in Orange County. Even though Johnny went off a cliff a few episodes ago, he's still pulling Ryan (Benjamin McKenzie) and Marissa (Mischa Barton) apart. First, Marissa had a thing for Johnny, as did her devious sister. Now Ryan is off on a road trip with Johnny's good-looking cousin Sadie (Nikki Reed, above, with Mr. McKenzie) to find Johnny's father. 9 P.M. (NBC) MY NAME IS EARL -- Years ago, Earl lost his father's beloved Mustang in a bet. Now he'll try to get it back. Beau Bridges guest stars as Earl's dad. 9 P.M. (Sci Fi) THE DAY AFTER -- (1983). Jason Robards and JoBeth Williams star in this grim television film, endlessly analyzed at the time, about the aftermath of thermonuclear war in Kansas. 10 P.M.

She'd probably be what the British call a ladette, a young woman trying to be one of the lads by drinking to excess, shouting four-letter words and, if necessary, belching. In ''LADETTE TO LADY,'' imported by the SUNDANCE CHANNEL (Thursday, 9 p.m.), some tasteful teachers play Henry Higgins at tasteful Eggleston Hall. They take on 10 proud ladettes, who compete to be transformed into the sorts of girls PRINCE WILLIAM could bring home. The first step is putting them into sweater sets and pearls. Even viewers who think most reality series are drivel may find this one entertaining. The British do that sort of thing so well. Then, sometimes, American television takes a British series and wrings the social anthropology out of it. Yes, the big one is back. ''SURVIVOR: PANAMA -- EXILE ISLAND'' has its season premiere Thursday night at 8 on CBS. A new batch of attractive people (including a retired astronaut, a performance artist and a social worker) compete for big money by being devious and manipulative. There is plenty of worthy, culturally significant programming ahead for Black History Month, but one of the most intriguing specials comes from an unlikely source: TV LAND. WAYNE BRADY is a much better stand-up comedian than he is a talk-show host, but he doesn't need to be scintillating on ''THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,'' which begins on Wednesday (10 p.m.). His guests (HARRY BELAFONTE, DIAHANN CARROLL, PAUL MOONEY and TOURÉ on the first of the three one-hour segments) take the ball and run with it, with some promising straight talk about perceptions of race in popular culture. The old clips and photos speak volumes. And the list of most influential black television shows puts ''THE JEFFERSONS'' ahead of ''ROOTS.''"

A little more than a month ago, the Steelers were 7-5 and struggling. But with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger healthy again, they are winning. ''We're the same team that went 15-1 last year and made it to the championship game,'' receiver Hines Ward said."

Ms. Dunaway plays a former Las Vegas showgirl with mob connections who gives a party at which one of the guests ends up dead. Gil Grissom (William Petersen, above, with Ms. Dunaway) is on the case, but the case is a particular problem for his associate Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) because her father (Scott Wilson) is a suspect. 8 P.M. (13) THE NEW ROYALS -- It's easy to forget that in some parts of the world, princes like William and Harry of Britain are more than just movie-star equivalents to fantasize and gossip about. This one-hour National Geographic special takes a look at monarchies (at least 28 still exist) and asks how kings and queens have managed to endure into the 21st century. 8 P.M. (NBC) WILL & GRACE -- During a dinner date they had really dreaded, Will and Grace get a major surprise. Their waiter is Will's former boyfriend Vince the policeman (Bobby Cannavale). Well, make that the former policeman. 9 P.M. (13) RICKY NELSON SINGS! -- In the late 1950's, as Nelson (1940-85) grew from the irrepressible Ricky into a brooding rock idol, he began doing musical numbers on his parents' squeaky-clean sitcom, ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.'' This one-hour profile includes some of those songs plus interviews with Nelson's children and friends. 9:30 P.M. (Sundance) FACE -- (2002). Bai Ling (left) stars in this drama as a rape victim going home to Queens after many years to reconnect with the daughter (Kristy Wu) born of that crime. The girl, brought up by her grandmother and now graduating from high school, is in love with a D.J. (the rapper Treach). 9:30 P.M. (ABC) CRUMBS -- Suzanne (Jane Curtin) finds the support group for recently divorced people unbelievably boring, so she joins a recovering drug addicts' group instead. 9:30 P.M. (NBC) THE OFFICE -- Michael (Steve Carell) realizes, for the first time, that his employees may not all adore him. To bond with them, he moves out into the bullpen. 10 P.M.

A1 U.S. Deaths in Iraq Accelerate Two marines were killed by insurgents in Anbar Province, the American military command said, and three American soldiers died a day earlier in a bombing in southern Baghdad, bringing the total of American troop deaths in Iraq this month to at least 53, a rate of almost four a day. A9 7 Killed, 1 Taken in Afghanistan Two Canadian soldiers in the NATO force were killed and three were wounded in an ambush in southern Afghanistan, an Afghan provincial council member was assassinated on his way to work, two police officers were killed near the border with Pakistan, two civilians were killed by a bomb, and an Italian photojournalist was reported to have been kidnapped by gunmen in southern Afghanistan. A6 Israeli Official May Be Charged After a nearly two-month inquiry, the Israeli police released a statement recommending that President Moshe Katsav face charges of rape and sexual assault allegedly committed against several women in his office. Israel's attorney general, Menachem Mazuz, must now decide whether to file such charges. A8 Video Disputes China's Claim A videotape that appears to show Chinese security forces shooting two Tibetan refugees in the Himalayas contradicts Beijing's claim that the refugees were shot when soldiers acted in self-defense. The New China News Agency said soldiers acted after refugees seeking to cross illegally into Nepal from China attacked border troops. A6 The Chinese police have charged a prominent human rights lawyer with inciting subversion, part of a crackdown on people who have sought to use China's nascent legal system to limit the power of the state. He was taken into custody in mid-August, but the police only recently made clear the nature of the charge, his lawyer said. A6 Thai AIDS Patients Shunned Thailand's primary AIDS hospice, once a place of certain death, is now becoming overcrowded by people whose lives have been saved by medication but are rejected by their families or neighbors. Thailand has become a pioneer in distributing low-cost drugs, which are available for all those who need them for less than a dollar per treatment. A8 Pope Names 4 Saints Pope Benedict XVI named four saints, among them two nuns who pioneered schools for women, including schools in the wilds of 19th-century frontier Indiana. The canonization ceremony was the second round of saints named by Benedict since he became pope in April 2005. A4 NATIONAL A12-17 Party Leaders Shift Focus To Winnable Campaigns The choices being made by top Republican and Democratic leaders are setting the strategic framework of the final weeks of Congressional campaigning. They signal, by where they are spending television money and other resources, the Senate and House races where they believe they have the best chance of success. A1 Tony Snow, the White House press secretary and former television commentator and radio host, is using his star power and conservative bona fides in a controversial and unprecedented way: by raising money for Republican candidates. A16 Coast Guard to Arm Lake Boats United States Coast Guard officials want to mount machine guns on their cutters and small boats around the Great Lakes as a counterterrorism measure, and plan to hold live fire exercises on the lakes. Some residents of the lakeside towns consider the idea to be potentially dangerous to ordinary boaters and a surprising place to be bracing for terrorists. A1 Earthquake Rocks Hawaii An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 rippled through the Hawaii islands, knocking out electrical power and triggering a landslide that rained boulders and debris on a major highway on the largest island. A12 Power Supply Trails Demand Companies are not building power plants and power lines fast enough to meet growing demand, according to a group recently assigned by the federal government to assure proper operation of the power grid. A14 Players Maintain Innocence Three former Duke University students told the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' that they were falsely accused of raping a woman hired to dance at a lacrosse team party. A14 SCIENCE/HEALTH Scientists Aid Paralyzed Man A team of neuroscientists reported that it had restored some movement and speech to a severely brain-damaged man by stimulating his brain with pulses of electric current. A14 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Pirro and Cuomo Clash In First Televised Debate The New York attorney general's race, one of the most combative and colorful political contests in recent memory, turned ever nastier as the two candidates, Jeanine F. Pirro and Andrew M. Cuomo, spent an hour attacking and undercutting each other in their first televised debate. A1 Final Concert for CBGB Last night was the last concert at CBGB, the famously crumbling rock club that has been in continuous, loud operation since December 1973. It served as the casual headquarters and dank incubator for some of New York's most revered groups, as well as thousands more whose blares left less of a mark on history but whose graffiti and concert fliers might still remain on its walls. B1 Lawyer Faces Sentencing Lynne F. Stewart, the lawyer who was convicted of aiding terrorists almost two years ago, will be sentenced in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The prosecution is seeking to condemn Ms. Stewart to 30 years in prison. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-10 Mets Win Evens Series The Mets rolled to a 12-5 victory against the Cardinals in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series at Busch Stadium, evening their best-of-seven series at two games apiece. D1 A New Power on L.P.G.A. Tour In a final-round duel at the Samsung World Championship, one of the L.P.G.A. Tour's biggest tournaments, Lorena Ochoa shot a final-round, seven-under-par 65 to defeat Annika Sorenstam by two shots, signaling a potential power shift on a tour Sorenstam has ruled.

Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt), friend and enabler to spirits trying to cross over into the next world, flashes back to the first time a dead person asked her for help. It was a little girl (Abigail Breslin, right, a star of ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' the Sundance Film Festival's latest hit) who wanted to communicate with her parents. Anne Archer guest-stars as Melinda's mother, who doesn't want to hear about her daughter's newly discovered powers. 8 P.M. (AMC) THE RIVER WILD (1994). Meryl Streep has never exactly done an action movie, but this one comes close. She plays a former whitewater rafting guide on vacation with her son. A good-looking young man (Kevin Bacon) flirts with her, but it turns out that he and his pal (John C. Reilly) are actually criminals who just want her help in their escape plans. 8 P.M. (FX) THAT 70'S SHOW -- Jessica Simpson (left) stars in this 2002 episode as a California girl who steals the heart of Kelso (Ashton Kutcher).

In addition, Mr. Hatch, 45, of Newport, R.I., plans to write a book about his experiences on ''Survivor'' and his legal problems. But in a telephone interview he also told The Dominion Post of Morgantown, W. Va., that when it comes to life in the minimum-security prison where he arrived on July 25 under a 51-month sentence, ''I don't think I will adjust to any of this until I can prove I was unethically prosecuted.'' Mr. Hatch was convicted by a federal jury in January and sentenced in May by a judge who said he had repeatedly lied on the witness stand. Pellicano Named In Wiretapping Suit A lawyer who represented the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian's former wife has sued Mr. Kerkorian's lawyers, contending that they illegally wiretapped his telephone conversations with her during her divorce proceedings, Bloomberg News reported. In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in Superior Court in Los Angeles, the lawyer, Stephen A. Kolodny, said Mr. Kerkorian's lawyers, Terry N. Christensen and Dennis Wasser, hired Anthony Pellicano, below, a Hollywood private investigator who was indicted in February, to wiretap the calls to gain a tactical advantage in the litigation between their client and his former wife, Lisa Kerkorian. Mr. Kolodny is seeking unspecified damages for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In February Mr. Christensen pleaded not guilty to criminal charges that he had paid Mr. Pellicano at least $100,000 to wiretap the telephone of Ms. Kerkorian. In 2002 Mr. Kerkorian and his former wife were involved in a legal dispute over child support. Mr. Christensen's lawyer, Terree A. Bowers, and Mr. Wasser did not immediately respond to calls for comment. Singing Lessons Give Jagger Satisfaction After 35 years without a singing lesson, Mick Jagger, below, has changed his tune. ''Better late than never,'' Mr. Jagger, 63, told Virgin Radio as he readied himself for the Rolling Stones concerts in London on Aug. 20 and 22 as part of the band's ''Bigger Bang'' world tour, Agence France-Presse reported. ''I did a bit of voice coaching a couple of years ago, after 35 years with no voice coaching,'' he said. ''A bit of voice coaching and warm-ups really helps. I always tell these younger singers, 'I never used to do it either, but you should.' '' He added: ''I mean, you sing a lot. Every night you are singing for hours and hours, and your voice gets tired, like anything -- like running every night. That's why you have to warm up properly. I just learned that, so that's probably helped me.'' Royalty and 'High Society' at Newport Jazz Festival Prince Albert II of Monaco will be on hand tonight when the Newport Jazz Festival begins with a concert that is part of an anniversary celebration of the 1956 film ''High Society,'' starring his mother, Grace Kelly, The Associated Press reported. Co-starring Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby, the film, with Newport, R.I., and its mansions as its backdrop, was the last Kelly made before her marriage to Prince Rainier III. The weekend festivities at the event, established in 1954 and now formally known as the JVC Jazz Festival Newport, include a private dinner-dance gala for Albert, 48, at Marble House, built as a Vanderbilt ''cottage,'' where ''High Society'' will be screened in various rooms. The opening-night concert, a tribute to Sinatra, will feature the guitarist and vocalist John Pizzarelli, who opened concerts for him in the early 1990's. ''There's an extra, added excitement to the whole thing,'' Mr. Pizzarelli said. ''It's more than just a music story, it seems, at this point.'' Philharmonic Opener Is Announced The New York Philharmonic, led by Lorin Maazel, will open its 165th season with a concert and gala on Sept. 13 at Avery Fisher Hall. The event will feature the pianists Emanuel Ax and Yefim Bronfman in Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos in E flat, and also Beethoven's ''Egmont'' Overture and Symphony No. 3, the ''Eroica.'' The concert will be broadcast on ''Live From Lincoln Center'' on PBS stations. Time Warp for 'Star Wars' The ''Star Wars'' epic runs for more than 13 hours, but George Lucas, below, has given permission to the Reduced Shakespeare Company to condense the proceedings into a 20-minute show, The Guardian of London reported. The Reduced Shakespeare Company has the right stuff. It raced through the ''Complete Works of Shakespeare'' in 97 minutes. Adam Long, who will write, direct and star in ''Star Wars -- Shortened'' with two other actors, said, ''In the space of 20 minutes, I'm going to be Jabba the Hutt, Jar Jar Binks, Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker.'' The show will be filmed for Sky Movies on Aug. 17 in a performance at the Criterion Theater in London."

At first, Timothy Treadwell (above) has the air of a noble environmentalist, living among grizzly bears in Alaska and fighting for the preservation of their habitat. But as Werner Herzog's documentary continues, Treadwell seems more and more like a deeply disturbed man, looking for fame while rejecting the civilized world. In 2003, after 13 summers in the wilds, a bear did attack and kill Treadwell and his girlfriend. His friends and family comment. 6 P.M. (TCM) IN WHICH WE SERVE (1942). TCM has started its monthlong salute to the Oscars, with a round-the-clock schedule of Academy Award-winning and nominated films and performances. This war drama, nominated for best picture, is a piece of British propaganda about a battleship, starring, directed (with David Lean) and written by Noël Coward, whose screenplay was also nominated. 8 P.M. (Fox) THE BERNIE MAC SHOW In this awardwinning sitcom's 100th episode (it had its premiere in November 2001), Bernie (Bernie Mac) encourages his nephew Jordan (Jeremy Suarez) to get to know his new neighbor, David (Kyle Kaplan, above right, with Mr. Suarez), because he's Jewish and it will expand Jordan's cultural horizons. David bores Jordan to death at first, until he learns about bar mitzvahs. What could be more culturallyenriching than a huge party -- with gift bags? 8 P.M. (IFC) MAX (2002).

And he may be hiding something. 10 P.M. (USA) MONK Money is on Adrian Monk's mind. But just as Monk (Tony Shalhoub), the lovable obsessivecompulsive detective, is about to ask for a raise, he and his faithful sidekick, Natalie (Traylor Howard, above, with Mr. Shalhoub), learn that the fabulous Alexander Diamond has been stolen from a local museum and there's a $1 million reward.

Almost immediately, nine of the country's largest real estate companies converted to REITs, while five others made the switch soon after and a handful more plan to follow suit by year-end. In the months leading up to the big debut, expectations ran high, with the hope that Britain's already-strong commercial real estate industry would further flourish.

A gaggle of reporters and cameramen followed him in a cart pulled by a tractor. The black bulls in the nearby pasture stayed away. ''A vague resemblance to the look of George W. Bush on his Texan ranch,'' is how the left-leaning newspaper Libération described Mr. Sarkozy, who was elected president on Sunday, beating the Socialist candidate Ségolène Royal in a runoff. The newspaper dismissed the event as a media stunt, saying, ''Everything for the image, right up until the last minute.''"

Behind the News -- The vote was the last real hurdle in a decades-long quest for a new stadium. The Yankees at one point threatened to move the team to New Jersey, and more recently Manhattan had been in the running. But in the end the team opted for a site next to the existing stadium in the South Bronx. The Council went along, over objections from neighborhood residents that the project would usurp parkland. SILICON VALLEY The News -- Apple Computer said it would introduce software to enable its Macintosh computers to run the Microsoft Windows operating system as well as its own. Behind the News -- For Apple, which had long ignored and even mocked Microsoft's product, the decision was nothing short of revolutionary. But it was based on a simple business calculus: limiting its computers to a single operating system had limited the company's growth. If Macintoshes can run the vast array of Windows-only software, Apple may grab more than its current 5 percent share of the PC market. WASHINGTON The News -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice lobbied Congress to support the administration's effort to aid India's nuclear power program. Behind the News -- Legislators had criticized the deal, citing concerns over India's nuclear weapons program. Ms. Rice sought to reassure the critics, saying she would push India to safeguard its civilian plants and block exports of weapons-making material. The calming words had an effect: several lawmakers offered qualified support for the agreement, leaving the White House optimistic that it would be approved. ISRAEL The News -- The Kadima Party, the winner in Israeli elections last month, said it would form a coalition with the Labor Party. Behind the News -- The announcement does not quite settle the issue of what the new government will look like, as two or three smaller parties will be needed to form a parliamentary majority. But it goes a long way toward ensuring the continuation of the policies of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who is incapacitated by a coma. The parties agree on critical policy, including the removal of more Israeli settlements from the West Bank. TV LAND The News -- Katie Couric, a fixture on NBC's ''Today'' for 15 years, will join CBS, where she will anchor the evening newscast. Behind the News -- For CBS, which courted Ms. Couric for a year, the move is an effort to attract new viewers to its newscast, a ratings also-ran in recent years. The hope is that some of her legions of fans who have made ''Today'' a ratings hit will start watching her at night. CBS may also be thinking that ''Today'' may stumble without her, creating an opening for the network's morning show, which is even more of a ratings laggard."

NBC's game show ''Deal or No Deal'' easily won the 8 p.m. hour in total viewers (15.38 million) and among 18-to-49-year-olds, and lifted the network to a second-place finish over all in that age group despite its weakened ''Apprentice'' (9.91 million). And Fox's ''24,'' which featured the deaths of Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) and Lynn McGill (Sean Astin), drew 13.57 million viewers, winning the 9 p.m. hour among adults 18 to 49.

This time around Adam Corolla, Adrianne Curry, George Foreman, Kathy Griffin, Bruce Vilanch and Betty White will provide the touch of raunch, with Ricki Lake overseeing the mayhem. 9 P.M. (13) A LION IN THE HOUSE -- Part 2 of this ''Independent Lens'' documentary, filmed over six years at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, looks at some of the obstacles facing five children with cancer and their families: the emotional and economic impact of experimental treatments, disparities among diagnoses and the difference between giving up and letting go. 9 P.M. (Sundance) HOUSE OF BOATENG -- Move over, Bravo. The Sundance Channel is posed to push ''Queer Eye'' and ''Project Runway'' off the catwalk with this new reality series following the British designer Ozwald Boateng (above), creative director of Givenchy, to America as he prepares to sink or swim. 9 P.M. (BBC America) WATERLOO ROAD -- What happens when the faculty at a troubled English high school is more out-of-control than the students? This series, that's what. In this new episode, a teacher announces she is pregnant, while another sets up a date with the principal. 11:35 (NBC) THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO -- Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! No, it's the plane flying in Kevin Spacey to promote his star turn in ''Superman Returns'' as Lex Luthor, a performance he says was inspired by Enron's deposed prince of darkness, Kenneth Lay. Taylor Hicks, who rose from Southern shlub to People magazine's hottest bachelor in the blink of an ''Idol,'' is the musical guest. 11:35 (CBS) LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN -- Shhh.

And those divisions are likely to intensify in what is expected to be a contentious fall election campaign. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows what one expert describes as a continuing ''chasm'' between the way Republicans and Democrats see the war. Three-fourths of the Republicans, for example, said the United States did the right thing in taking military action against Iraq, while just 24 percent of the Democrats did. Independents split down the middle."

The Simon Cowell-produced show, with Regis Philbin, above, as its host, drew 12.1 million viewers between 9 p.m. and 11. In the earlier prime-time hour, NBC broadcast a rerun of ''Dateline'' (6.4 million), which nearly dragged its overall ratings out of the No. 1 slot, as Fox finished a close second. Its competing talent show, ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' also from the ''American Idol'' family tree, brought in 8.9 million viewers and a strong sampling from the 18-to-49 demographic. On CBS, the ''Big Brother: All Stars'' casting special led off the night. Twenty former housemates from the ''No Exit''-like reality show's six previous seasons are competing for 12 slots in the new house; an audience of 6.1 million cared. KATE AURTHUR"

But that was six months and two executive producers ago. (First, Steven Bochco replaced Rod Lurie, the creator of the series, as the executive in charge of the show, and now Dee Johnson has taken over from Mr. Bochco.) On Thursday, a retooled ''Commander in Chief'' appeared for the first time since January, and the results were not pretty. It drew an estimated 8.2 million viewers, and in the 10 p.m. hour, was last among adults 18 to 49, behind CBS's ''Without a Trace'' (18.65 million) and a rerun of NBC's ''ER'' (6.03 million). It even lost viewers from its first half-hour (8.25 million) to its second (8.13 million), never a good sign.

But Kermit, singing ''The Rainbow Connection'' to raise money for a family beset by problems, did not draw as large an audience as the women of Wisteria Lane do; and though ABC was No. 1 among adults 18 to 49, it lost to CBS among total viewers for the night. By running into prime time, the Masters golf tournament helped CBS, but because it was live, its Nielsen estimates were preliminary. NBC placed third for the night among total viewers and fourth, behind Fox, in the 18-to-49 demographic.

Three out of the seven Camden kids, who grew up on the show, announced toward the end of the episode that they would be having twins; 7.17 million viewers were thankful for finales. That audience was the largest of WB's season, and pushed ''Everwood,'' a critically praised drama that might not make the new CW lineup, to 4.23 million viewers. As has been the recent pattern on Mondays, Fox was No. 1 among adults 18 to 49, and CBS drew the most total viewers in Nielsen's estimates.

The poll showed that 29 percent of Americans approve of the way President Bush is managing the war, matching the lowest mark of his presidency.

Now even that well-earned reputation for flawless fictionalizing is coming undone. Watching the administration try to get its story straight about Iran's role in Iraq last week was like watching third graders try to sidestep blame for misbehaving while the substitute teacher was on a bathroom break. The team that once sold the country smoking guns in the shape of mushroom clouds has completely lost its mojo. Surely these guys can do better than this. No sooner did unnamed military officials unveil their melodramatically secretive briefing in Baghdad last Sunday than Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, blew the whole charade. General Pace said he didn't know about the briefing and couldn't endorse its contention that the Iranian government's highest echelons were complicit in anti-American hostilities in Iraq. Public-relations pandemonium ensued as Tony Snow, the State Department and finally the president tried to revise the story line on the fly. Back when Karl Rove ruled, everyone read verbatim from the same script. Last week's frantic improvisations were vintage Scooter Libby, at best the ur-text for a future perjury trial."

Behind the News -- The redesign eliminates underground galleries where the names of the 9/11 victims would be inscribed. Instead, the names will be found on a plaza above the voids where the towers stood. This and other changes will lower the price tag by $162 million. Still, the project is estimated to cost $510 million. A COMMITMENT The News -- Japan announced that it would begin pulling troops out of Iraq. Behind the News -- About 600 soldiers have been in southern Iraq since 2004, providing reconstruction assistance. The contingent is Japan's most significant military mission since World War II. Despite the withdrawal plans, Japan remains a supporter of the American effort in Iraq. Even as he announced that the troops' mission was fulfilled, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the air force would increase its support flights for American soldiers. A TEAM The News -- It was a bad World Cup for Serbia and Montenegro. Behind the News -- The team, which had performed well in qualifying for the tournament, lost all three of its matches, including a 6-0 shellacking at the hands of Argentina. Worse, though, the team also lost its country: with Montenegro's secession in an independence referendum, Serbia and Montenegro no longer exists. The coach said the political division had a demoralizing effect on the squad. Serbia will begin fielding its own national team next month; the future of Montenegrin soccer is less clear. A CAREER The News -- Dan Rather and CBS News parted ways after 44 years, and Mr. Rather was weighing an offer to work for a fledgling high-definition channel. Behind the News -- CBS announced Mr. Rather's departure -- five months before his contract was to expire -- praising him as one of the giants of television journalism. But Mr. Rather did not hide his displeasure at what he perceived as the network's refusal to give him significant work since he stepped down as anchor of the evening news last year after a reporting scandal. A FAMILY TREE The News -- The pool of Genghis Khan's descendants is not quite as big as thought. Behind the News Although a genetic test had shown that Thomas R. Robinson, an accounting professor in Florida, was descended from the Mongol conqueror, a more complete test showed that the initial result was faulty. The reversal may be a bit of a blow to Mr. Robinson, but it hardly takes the sheen off Genghis's image. He and his relatives amassed so many concubines that, by one estimate, 16 million men in Central Asia carry his Y chromosome."

2441,,The Accorsi Scorecard,http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E6DF1331F934A25751C1A9609C8B63,"The Ernie Accorsi Era for the Giants started after the 1997 season, when he took over as the general manager when George Young retired. Nine years later, it is Accorsi who is retiring at season's end. In many ways, he will be judged by the future performance of quarterback Eli Manning, right, acquired in a draft-day trade with the San Diego Chargers in 2004. Here are some of the other players who will help define Accorsi's legacy with the Giants. JOHN BRANCH HITS QB Kerry Collins (acquired: 1999) A controversial acquisition because of personal problems and declining statistics, Collins was resurrected with the Giants, playing five seasons and leading the 2000 team to the Super Bowl. LT Luke Petigout (1999) The Giants' first choice in the draft (19th over all), who is currently injured, is the respected protector of Manning's back side. TE Jeremy Shockey (2002) Accorsi moved up a spot in the first round of the draft to choose Shockey, who has made three Pro Bowls in four years. DE Osi Umenyiora (2003) Chosen in the second round, he was coveted by the Chargers as part of the Manning trade. Accorsi held firm, and Umenyiora became a premier rusher. G David Diehl (2003) Chosen in the fifth round, the starting left guard is one of several key players chosen on the second day of the draft. Others include linebacker Brandon Short, receiver David Tyree, safety Gibril Wilson, running back Brandon Jacobs and defensive tackle Barry Cofield. MLB Antonio Pierce (2005) Signed as a free agent, Pierce has been the defense's most consistent player and its main font of attitude. WR Plaxico Burress (2005) Signed as a free agent, the tall and lanky Burress has become the team's best big-play receiver -- and a constant source of mild off-field controversy. P Jeff Feagles (2003) He had already played 15 seasons when he signed as a free agent, but he seems to have become better. MISSES RB Ron Dayne (2000) The Giants' top pick (11th over all) in the draft, Dayne is Accorsi's biggest miscalculation. The silver lining: Dayne's shortcomings fueled the dependence on Tiki Barber, and Brandon Jacobs may become the bruising back Dayne was not. LB LaVar Arrington (2006) Signed last spring, Arrington brought a positive resolve and a few games of decent play before his season ended with an Achilles' injury. He hopes to return in 2007. CB's Will Allen and Will Peterson (2001) Accorsi never found a Pro Bowl-caliber defensive back, and fell short by using the first two choices of the draft on Allen and Peterson. DT William Joseph (2003) A first-round choice, Joseph has struggled to slip into the lineup past lesser-known players, and finds playing time mostly thanks to injuries. WR Joe Jurevicius (1998) He was getting better each season when the Giants let him slip away in free agency in 2002. He played in Super Bowls with Tampa Bay and Seattle, and the Giants went through a forgettable cast of replacements until Burress arrived. LB Carlos Emmons (2004) The Giants snagged him from the rival Eagles in free agency. He has struggled with injuries and struggled to make a big impact when healthy."

Sent to Madrid in 1943, first as an Assistant Press Attache of the American Embassy and later correspondent for the Overseas News Organization and CBS, he was the first journalist to expose the fascist Franco regime. His frank and honest reporting led to the Spanish government forcing him to surrender his credentials under the threat of explusion from the country. After returning from Spain, he worked as a public relations officer in Nelson Rockefeller's Office of Inter-American Affairs then went on to be a public information officer at the United Nations. He moved to Mexico in 1961 and subsequently won the Francisco Zarco award for the best international reporting on Mexico in 1968. An authority on the economy and investments in Mexico, Mr. Wise has written articles on theses subjects as correspondent to the New York Times and London Times as well as the Wall Street Journal. Over the span of his journalistic career, he knew and interviewed many of Latin America's most notable dignitaries, including Fidel Castro. He was owner and publisher of The Mexican Investor newsletter which in 1976, along with its money management business, was merged to Accival, a private stock brokerage. He later founded the investment firm Mexican Financial Advisory Service. In 1973 Doubleday published a worldwide edition of his book ''Invest and Retire in Mexico.'' He was a consultant to a number of organizations including Union Carbide Mexicana, Syntex, Alexander Proudfoot PLC and IBM de Mexico. He was predeceased by his second wife, author and playwright Margarita Urueta, after 40 years of marriage, and his son Jeffrey Wise. He is survived by his three daughters, Wendy, Carol, and Anne, his sister Edna and six grandchildren."

Yes, perhaps soon, it will possible to pay $100 or more for a ticket and be subjected to a product pitch before the curtain rises. The Guardian of London reported that a live commercial was to be enacted on Tuesday at the Gaiety Theater in Dublin before a performance of ''Saturday Night Fever.'' In a three-minute presentation to promote the West End in London to international theatergoers, six actors planned to use dialogue to reproduce the sights and sounds of London. The report said that the commercial would also be staged in Hamburg, Germany; New York; and Pittsburgh. Death Fast Urged As a 'Da Vinci' Protest A Roman Catholic organization in India has urged Christians to starve themselves to death to protest the release of ''The Da Vinci Code'' in movie theaters there, Agence France-Presse reported. Joseph Dias, the secretary general of the Catholic Secular Forum, who spoke of the ''fast unto death'' as a demonstration of ''the extent that our feelings have been hurt,'' said that it is ''a more Christian way of doing things rather than pulling down things and tearing them up.'' The forum said that it hoped that thousands of people would turn out for a protest today in Mumbai to burn effigies of Dan Brown, the author of the best-selling novel that is the basis for the film, scheduled for international release on May 19. Yesterday about 100 people gathered in Mumbai to burn pages of the book, but the police stopped them from torching an effigy of Mr. Brown, whose novel posits that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had children and that their line survives. About 2 percent of the 1.1 billion people in India are Christian. Old Vic Eyes New Season Kevin Spacey, left, will star in a London production of O'Neill's ''Moon for the Misbegotten,'' according to the Old Vic company's announcement of the schedule for Mr. Spacey's third season as its artistic director. The O'Neill play, to run from Sept. 15 to Dec. 23, will be staged by Howard Davies, who directed Mr. Spacey in the well-received 1999 Broadway production of O'Neill's ''Iceman Cometh.'' The Old Vic season also includes Shakespeare's ''Taming of the Shrew'' and ''Twelfth Night,'' to be presented in repertory in January, when Edward Hall will direct his all-male company, Propeller. Beginning in late February, the Old Vic will celebrate the 50th anniversary of ''The Entertainer,'' by John Osborne, with a new production starring Robert Lindsay as the aging and desperate comedian Archie Rice. Joyce Kilmer Would Approve The Mayor of Madrid, faced with protests and a threat from Carmen Cervera, the Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza, below, has suspended plans to uproot centuries-old trees from the Paseo del Prado to make way for a pedestrian-friendly ''art walk,'' Agence France-Presse reported. Mayor Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón said that the public would now have six months to express its concerns to urban planners. The city said that the plan would affect only 29 trees; ecologists have put the number as high as 700. The baroness, a self-described nature lover whose family's renowned art collected is exhibited in a mansion on the street, had said she would tie herself to a tree to protest the plan. Footnotes The run of the Lincoln Center Theater revival of Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing!'' at the Belasco Theater has been extended for two weeks, through June 25. Christine Lahti, below, was withdrawn from the world premiere of ''The Busy World Is Hushed,'' the Keith Bunin drama that is to be the final production of Playwrights Horizons' 35th-anniversary season. She will be replaced by Jill Clayburgh. An announcement yesterday from the press representatives for the play attributed Ms. Lahti's withdrawal ''to family matters that necessitate her returning to the West Coast.'' The announcement said that a new date for the first preview, originally scheduled for May 27, would be announced soon, along with new opening and closing dates for the limited run. No more than a week's postponement of the first preview is expected. Nick Young has been named anchor of CBS Radio News's 68-year-old ''World News Roundup,'' described as the longest-running news program in American broadcast journalism. Mr. Young, who joined CBS Radio News in 1990, succeeds Christopher Glenn, who retired this year after 35 years with CBS. Mr. Young's appointment is effective immediately, CBS announced."

A professional interior designer for over 50 years, Berenice was equally proud of her achievements as a painter, illustrator, portraitist, performing artist and political activist. She studied at Columbia University, entering at age 14, and later at the Parsons School of Design and at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Fontainebleau, France. When World War II broke out, she postponed further, studies and went to work for British War Relief and later the USO, performing as a vocalist and sketching the world at war on the homefront, in New York and in Montreal. Berenice became recognized as a skilled portraitist, meeting and drawing, to name a few, Hector Villa-Lobos, Andres Segovia, Charles De Gaulle, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Edward R. Murrow and a great number of United Nations ambassadors and delegates of the post-war infant organization at Lake Success, New York, where she was artistcorrespondent for ONA and several magazines. Her portrait of Edward R. Murrow is on display at CBS Broadcasting. Politically, Berenice headed the New York Speakers Bureau for Americans for Democratic Action and was active in the Democratic Party. In 1953 Berenice married Alfred H. Hetkin, a prominent New York real estate law attorney. Their marriage lasted more than 20 years. After the death of Mr. Hetkin, she remained close to her stepdaughter Maria Illo.

So on to summer: This week brings us the premieres of Mark Burnett's new reality treasure hunt, ''PIRATE MASTER'' (8 p.m. Thursday, CBS), and Kevin Williamson's ''O.C.''-in-the-desert melodrama, ''HIDDEN PALMS'' (8 p.m. Wednesday, CW). Taylor Handley, who played the evil Oliver Trask in the first season of the real ''O.C.,'' now gets to play the Ryan character, a troubled teenager who moves to Palm Springs and discovers that he's the normal one. My own mindless-fun pick: the second season of ''HEX'' (8 p.m. Saturday, BBC America), the cheap-and-dirty, and highly entertaining, British ''Buffy'' clone. A full night of ''The Real World'' on MTV culminates in the first episode of a new six-episode spinoff, ''REUNITED: THE REAL WORLD VEGAS'' (10 p.m. Wednesday), in which cast members from the 2002 Las Vegas season reconvene in the same suite at the Palms. How long will it be before Steven, Brynn and Trishelle get back in the hot tub? Start your office pool now. Three months after Bob Woodruff's ''To Iraq and Back,'' CBS presents a special about the other high-profile American television journalist to be seriously wounded (so far) in Iraq: ''FLASHPOINT: KIMBERLY DOZIER AND THE ARMY'S FOURTH ID'' (10 p.m. Tuesday). Katie Couric anchors the program. Ian Somerhalder, whose Boone was one of the first casualties of ''Lost,'' turns up as the prettiest explorer you've ever seen on the Hallmark Channel's ''MARCO POLO'' (8 p.m. Saturday). The three-hour movie is a Robert Halmi production and as corny and campy as that suggests (Brian Dennehy as Kublai Khan!); watch for the moment when B. D. Wong, as Marco's assigned servant, Pedro, looks deep into Mr. Somerhalder's eyes and murmurs: ''I am to be your slave. My master's every desire is my only happiness.''"

And ''CSI'' (22.91 million) drew its lowest 18-to-49 rating for an original episode since October 2001 (not counting its broadcast opposite the ''Friends'' series finale two years ago). Fox, which has a solid schedule from Sunday through Wednesday, finished fourth for the night. Its once-dominant ''O.C.'' delivered a mere 5.03 million viewers, who watched Summer and Seth break up for the umpteenth time; the series's audience was the lowest it has ever had for an original episode among both total viewers and adults 18 to 49.

For years now, his advertising archrival (Jon Lovitz, guest star) has been beating him out at the awards banquet. So this time, Charlie decides to boycott. 9 P.M.

He shot, and perhaps killed, Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby (Cynthia Watros). But the first half of that episode faced the formidable competition of an ''American Idol'' results show on Fox (28.5 million); despite a strong performance in the ratings (15.03 million), ''Lost'' was still trounced. Fox won the night in Nielsen's estimates in total viewers and among adults 18 to 49. On ''Idol,'' Paris Bennett, right, who sang Prince and Mary J.

Ms. McPhee will vie for the ''Idol'' prize against Taylor Hicks, Chris Daughtry and Elliott Yamin.

Behind the News -- With the creation of CW, Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, has his eye on youth. CBS is the best performer among all networks, but its least success is with the under-35 crowd. Neither UPN nor WB has raked in the money, but shows like UPN's ''Everybody Hates Chris'' and ''Friday Night Smackdown'' and WB's ''Gilmore Girls'' and ''Smallville'' play to that critical demographic. MICKEY 'N' WOODY The News -- Walt Disney said Tuesday that it would acquire Pixar Animation Studios in a $7.4 billion stock deal. Behind the News -- This deal has a lot to do with the companies' creative cultures. One animation blockbuster after another in recent years has come from Pixar, creator of ''Toy Story'' and ''The Incredibles,'' aided by the innovative use of computer technology. Disney, by contrast, is the old-fashioned grandfather of animation, with fewer hits of recent vintage. The deal promises to give Pixar's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, a powerful role in Hollywood. NO LONGER BETWEEN THE COVERS The News -- Oprah Winfrey withdrew her support for James Frey and ''A Million Little Pieces,'' his ''memoir'' about his trip into and out of the depths of drug addiction. Behind the News -- It's still a best seller. Still the fastest-moving book ever to be featured in Ms. Winfrey's television book club. Still the second-highest-selling book of 2005. It's not still a work of nonfiction, apparently, after Ms. Winfrey decided that dismissing the fictions of the book as nitpickery had been a mistake on her part. What is not yet clear is whether all the controversy will add to the huge sales of the book -- as well as Mr. Frey's follow-up book, ''My Friend Leonard'' -- or put a halt to them. That may depend on whether readers feel as Nan A. Talese, Mr. Frey's publisher, does about the genre. ''Memoir,'' Ms. Talese said, ''is personal recollection. It is not absolute fact. It's how one remembers what happened. That is different from history and criticism and biography, and they cannot be measured by the same yardstick.'' Time and sales will tell. GOODBYE, GRACE The News -- NBC said it would cancel ''Will & Grace'' and ''The West Wing'' at the end of the season. Behind the News -- The two series have been among NBC's most popular recent shows, but their ratings have fallen in the last two seasons and, more to the point, the network over all now trails its rivals. So there will be a shuffling of the new reliables in prime time, as well as the addition of some new shows. When viewers tune in to Turin next month for the Olympic Games, they'll get a look at the new lineup."

Mr. Bush's approval ratings for his management of foreign policy, Iraq and the economy have fallen to the lowest levels of his presidency. He drew poor marks on the issues that have been at the top of the national agenda in recent months, in particular immigration and gasoline prices."

The numbers do suggest, though, that NBC's ''My Name Is Earl'' and the 90-minute ''Dancing With the Stars'' on ABC have had some impact on the previously impenetrable ''CSI.'' At 9:30, when both shows ended, CBS's forensics ace in the hole went from an audience of 25.11 million for its first half-hour to 28.61 million for its second. ''Dancing'' (18.83 million) again helped the new Fred Savage sitcom, ''Crumbs,'' which delivered 11.45 million viewers. And on NBC, though ''Earl'' (10.75 million) and ''The Office'' (8.7 million) continue to do well in their new slots, ''Four Kings'' deteriorated, with 7.46 million viewers. At 10 p.m., ''Without a Trace'' faced ''Primetime Live'' on ABC (6.73 million) and a repeat of ''ER'' (7.41 million) on NBC.

But that comedic soap opera was still by far the night's most watched show in Nielsen's estimates, with 19.74 million viewers. That helped the series premiere of ''What About Brian,'' which took the place of ''Grey's Anatomy'' at 10 p.m. The wistful ''Brian'' delivered 12.84 million viewers, meaning it lost a significant number of the ''Housewives'' audience. But in the 18-to-49 demographic, it fared better, and easily beat NBC's ''Crossing Jordan'' (12.46 million) and the conclusion of the CBS movie ''Covert One: The Hades Factor'' (6.76 million from 9 to 11 p.m.). On the Sunday schedule, NBC's ''West Wing'' (8.28 million) was not the only veteran show about to end its run forever.

ABC's Thursdays have had poor ratings this season, so ''Dancing'' was a big improvement over the sinking ''Alias'' and the canceled ''Night Stalker.'' The network finished in second place in total viewers. NBC also made a mark with its lineup changes. ''Will & Grace'' (7.98 million) moved to 8 p.m., in place of ''Joey,'' now on hiatus, and performed better than the woeful ''Friends'' spinoff did among 18-to-49-year-olds. ''Four Kings,'' from the creators of ''Will & Grace,'' made its debut at 8:30, and improved on its predecessor's demographic ratings, as well as its total audience (8.84 million). ''My Name Is Earl'' (11.2 million) and ''The Office'' (8.83 million), in their Thursday debuts this season, also did well among adults 18 to 49, with ''Earl'' getting the best ratings in that age group at 9 p.m. since the ''Apprentice'' finale in May. NBC placed second for the night in the same group. But with all these changes, one thing remained the same: ''CSI'' was on CBS's schedule.

The hourlong results broadcast, in the unusual period of 8:30 to 9:30 p.m., drew an estimated 21.83 million viewers. Relative to the show's own smashing success, that audience was smaller than usual. But it was good enough to put Fox far ahead in first place for the night and do more damage to ABC's ''Lost.'' Wednesday's episode of the plane-crash mystery revealed that the island had cured not only the paralysis of Locke (Terry O'Quinn) but also the previously terminal illness of Rose (L. Scott Caldwell). ''Lost'' delivered its lowest 18-to-49 rating of the season (15.15 million), but it was still strong enough to put ABC in second place in that measurement over all. On Wednesday, April 5, the day Katie Couric announced that she would be leaving the ''Today'' show, the program brought in 6.2 million viewers and held that audience for the rest of the week. That was an improvement over the Monday (5.7 million) and Tuesday (5.5 million) viewer totals. For the week as a whole, ''Today'' was in first place, as it always is, outpacing ABC's ''Good Morning America'' (4.8 million) and CBS's ''Early Show'' (2.8 million). KATE AURTHUR"

Frank Scandale, the editor of the newspaper, said a service would be hired to examine the dozen or so feature articles written by Ms. Viswanathan. He said: ''To us she was a bright young kid that seemed to have the makings of a good writer. There were no alarms; nobody ever questioned any of her stories. We have no reason to believe there's anything wrong with her copy. But in light of what's going on, we thought we should check her stuff out.'' Ms. Viswanathan's debut novel, ''How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life,'' was withdrawn from bookstores by Little, Brown after she admitted copying passages from two novels by Megan McCafferty. Ms Viswanathan has said the copying was ''unconscious and unintentional.'' Another Victory for Fox Another Tuesday, another dominant performance by Fox. More than 28 million viewers watched the final five contestants sing two songs each on ''American Idol,'' and ''House'' drew more than 22.7 million, according to Nielsen's estimates. For the night, Fox averaged more than 25 million viewers; CBS, which finished second, averaged 11.4 million. ''NCIS'' (14.9 million viewers) and ''The Unit'' (14 million) performed well for the network, but CBS's ''Dynasty Reunion'' was poorly attended: only 5.35 million viewers caught up with Krystle and Alexis. Fox also was a decisive winner among 18-to-49-year-old viewers. All three of ABC's comedies -- ''According to Jim,'' ''Hope and Faith,'' and ''Less Than Perfect'' -- had notably small audiences, and the network finished fourth for the night even with a solid performance by ''Boston Legal'' (more than 10 million viewers). The David E. Kelley drama has been renewed for next season. New Raid on Greek Home Of Former Curator The Greek police have again raided an island villa owned by Marion True, below, the former antiquities curator at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles who is on trial in Rome on charges of conspiring to deal in looted archaeological artifacts, Reuters reported. In the raid on her home on the island of Paros in the Cyclades in connection with a continuing investigation of antiquities smuggling, the police said they had found a dozen ancient works, including two small marble sarcophagi believed to date from around the time of Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.). A police statement said that ''several objects were confiscated as illegally possessed.'' The police said the objects were not found during their raid in March because they had been incorporated into the architecture of the home and were not apparent. Ms. True has not been charged. Michael Brand, director of the Getty, will visit Athens on May 16 for talks with the culture minister, George Voulgarakis, the ministry said. How Do You Spell Hot? After a dozen years on ESPN, the National Spelling Bee, which began in 1925 with nine contestants, is going prime time.

2860,,Under the Radar but Well Worth Their Grammy Invitations,http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DD103FF932A25751C0A9619C8B63,"ON the Grammy Awards telecast Sunday night on CBS, many musicians' names will flash by just before commercials: the winners in dozens of categories that don't fit in prime time. The Grammys try to notice every niche of popular music and, with 108 categories this year, they can't keep up. But they do delve well beyond the Top 10 and the familiar names on the television show. I'm not picking winners here. The Grammys are inscrutable, especially in categories with only a coterie of voters, but these nominated albums and songs deserve their instant of Grammy attention. Dafnis Prieto The best Latin jazz album category holds more musical brainpower attached to more twisted melodies and more kinetic rhythms than any other Grammy niche. Lately Latin musicians have revitalized some of the knottiest structures of 1960s jazz, then gone on to make them dance, and all five entries in this category -- including those by Edsel Gomez, Ignacio Berroa, the Brian Lynch/Eddie Palmieri Project and Diego Urcola -- are worth hearing. The most brilliantly convoluted of the nominees is ''Absolute Quintet'' (Zoho) by the Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto. His playing flaunts every shift built into his compositions and infuses every unexpected turn with a sense of joyful discovery. Casey Driessen Acoustic pickers and fiddlers have taken over the best country instrumental performance category, which includes Casey Driessen's ''Jerusalem Ridge,'' a thoroughly unorthodox remake of a fiddle tune from Bill Monroe. It's on Mr. Driessen's album ''3D'' (Sugar Hill). Over a choppy strummed beat that's almost funky, multiple fiddles come and go -- grappling with one another, sharing the tune as a chorale, switching its beat, even briefly carrying it eastward. It's a tour de force that still holds on to the tune's Celtic roots. Sex Mob The best contemporary jazz album category is usually good for tepid pop-jazz, but not this year. Sex Mob's ''Sexotica'' (Thirsty Ear) is the avant-gutbucket New York City brass-and-saxophone band's tribute to Martin Denny, a purveyor of lounge-music exotica in the 1950s and 1960s. The concept gives Sex Mob, led by Steven Bernstein on slide trumpet, excuses to toy with an international assortment of percussion and Mr. Denny's slinky modal tunes. It's sly and boisterous music, poised between parody and skeptical appreciation. The remixers Good and Evil sometimes toss in samples or chop up the music just to add an extra level of disorientation. Tye Tribbett In a year of increasingly grim wartime news, gospel insists on hope. Perhaps it's no accident that two nominees for best gospel performance are songs called ''Victory'': one by Tye Tribbett and one by Yolanda Adams. Ms. Adams sings with a soul belter's intensity about overcoming material hardships in her ''Victory'' (Verity). But Mr. Tribbett promises even greater empowerment to believers. Backed by an choir, razzle-dazzle horns and a funk rhythm section worthy of Prince on ''Victory Live!'' (Columbia), he bounces exhortations and percussive screams off his choir's enthusiastic responses, promising, ''Every situation I face I win/And everything works for my good in the end.'' The Flaming Lips Best rock instrumental is where straight-faced old-school lead guitarists -- Peter Frampton, Joe Satriani, David Gilmour -- run into alt-rockers like Arctic Monkeys and the Flaming Lips, whose ''The Wizard Turns On '' (from the Warner Brothers album ''At War With the Mystics'') is the goofiest nominated track. After a full 45 seconds of feedback and distortion, the song coalesces, more or less, into a woozy psychedelic march, smudging its own pomp with stray electronic noises and outlandishly wah-wahed guitar before melting down again. Alongside it the guitar heroes sound corny. Oscar D'León The Venezuelan singer, bandleader and bass player Oscar D'León has been a champion of classic salsa, but ''Fuzionando'' (Norte/Sony BMG), nominated for best tropical Latin album, announces its intentions in its title: it fuses salsa with reggaetón, flamenco and rock. The ambitions are pan-Latin, with some social commentary on black pride amid songs about love and dancing, echoing the 1970s legacy of pan-American thinkers like Rubén Blades. The music is buoyant and affable, perhaps because Mr. D'León knows he can outsing any of his guests. Northern Cree and Friends Drums pound steadily and voices whoop and shriek on ''Long Winter Nights: Round Dance Live'' (Canyon) by Northern Cree and Friends, a nominee for best Native American music album. It's stark traditionalist music with a primal, frenzied edge from singers who shout, wail, ululate and hoot bird cries. And when English lyrics arrive, some of them turn out to be deeply infuriated breakup songs. Buick Project Dance-music remixers are simultaneously restrictive and extravagant. They quantize vocals to fit a metronomic dance beat, but also freely reimagine songs after they've been reduced to their barest remnants. Nominated for best remixed recording, nonclassical, Buick Project's remix of ''Damage'' (Fine/Four Music Productions) by the German production team Tiefschwarz, featuring Tracey Thorn, makes a lonely song even lonelier. The remix keeps the synthetic bassline but turns the original's crisp chords into murky clouds; it puts space between electro blips, so they sound more like heart-monitor alerts or pacemaker jolts; and it leaves Ms. Thorn sounding more stranded than ever as she sings, ''I was always there, but you never chose to care.'' Hossein Alizadeh and Djivan Gasparyan The tone is mournful, the pace is measured and the atmosphere is profound on ''Endless Vision'' (World Village). It is nominated for best traditional world music album, but it crosses some traditional boundaries. Hossein Alizadeh, from Iran, is a virtuoso on Persian lutes who plays, on this album, the six-stringed shurangiz. Djivan Gasparyan is Armenian and plays the duduk, a liquid-toned reed flute. They recorded this live in Tehran, Iran, with a group that included male and female vocalists -- a rare mixed-gender ensemble -- singing recent and ancient poetry with a somber concentration that almost suspends time."

A6 Pelosi Arrives in Syria Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, arrived in Syria for a visit that is seen as part of an attempt to sway Bush administration policy on Iraq and the Middle East. A6 Blair Hopeful in Iran Dispute Prime Minister Tony Blair said that he was still hoping to secure through diplomatic means the release of the 15 British sailors and marines captured by Iran and that the next 48 hours would be ''fairly critical'' in resolving the dispute. A5 Behind the crisis of Iran's detention of the Britons lies an internal Iranian struggle pitting radicals, aligned with the president, against more pragmatic officials concerned about the country's growing isolation. A5 An Iranian diplomat kidnapped by men wearing uniforms of the Iraqi Security Forces was freed in Baghdad, Iraq's foreign minister said, adding he continued to work to free five other Iranians held by American military forces.

The New Zealand Herald reported that the surgery was intended to relieve a blood clot on the brain, an operation that normally involves drilling a hole through the skull to drain the clot. Mr. Richards's publicists would not comment on the report. In a statement issued in London, they said, ''The operation was a complete success, and Keith is already up and talking with his family today.'' It added, ''He will need a few weeks' recuperation.'' As a result, early dates on the European leg of the Stones' Bigger Bang tour were canceled. Rescheduling is to be announced. Mr. Richards, 62, left, was flown to Auckland, New Zealand, after the accident, which followed the portion of the tour that included Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand. Last week a spokeswoman for the band said he had suffered only a mild concussion and would not require surgery. '60 Minutes' Recruits Anderson Cooper Anderson Cooper will contribute as many as five reports a year to CBS News's ''60 Minutes'' beginning with the start of the 2006-7 television season. An announcement yesterday from Sean McManus, the president of CBS News and Sports, and Jonathan Klein, the president of CNN's domestic operations, said that Mr. Cooper, left, the anchor of ''Anderson Cooper 360,'' would remain a full-time employee of CNN, and that the new arrangement allows a one-time rebroadcast of his ''60 Minutes'' reports on his CNN program. Yesterday's announcement came less than two months after Mike Wallace, a correspondent on ''60 Minutes'' since its inception in September 1968, said he would retire this spring, at the end of the current season. Mr. Wallace turns 88 today. David Bowie Ushers In The High Line Festival David Bowie, below, will headline his first New York City concert in four years when he takes to the stage next May as the curator and a co-founder of the High Line Festival, a new 10-day outpouring of music, nightlife, visual art, performance and film. The festival, envisioned as an annual event, will take place at street level and in the vicinity of the High Line, an abandoned 1.5-mile West Side railroad viaduct that is being transformed into an 22-block elevated park above 10th and 11th Avenues between 34th Street and Gansevoort Street; its first phase is scheduled for completion in 2008. The inaugural festival will culminate in an outdoor concert by Mr. Bowie, a founder of the event with the producers David Binder and Josh Wood. Each year a different person, from music, film or other arts, will be chosen as the curator, who will shape its content. In an statement Mr. Bowie said, ''I've been particularly excited about seeking out emerging artists and giving them a place in a festival that will also feature some very well-known names.'' Fats Domino Bows Out Hours before he was to take the stage as the headliner on Sunday, the final day of the 37th annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Fats Domino, 78, below, canceled his performance, The Associated Press reported. ''He wasn't feeling well, so we took him to the doctor,'' said Haydee Ellis, a longtime friend. ''He's O.K., but he doesn't feel up to performing.'' Later Mr. Domino, a native of New Orleans and a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, briefly appeared onstage, apologized to the crowd that had come to hear him and thanked fans for their support, the first since Hurricane Katrina devastated the city last year. He lost his home, his pianos and his gold and platinum records in the hurricane. Last week he canceled an autograph session for his latest album, ''Alive and Kickin','' saying he was tired and wanted to rest for his show on Sunday.

Its ''Desperate Housewives'' (an estimated 22.03 million viewers) and ''Grey's Anatomy'' (22.39 million) cleaned up in all ratings measurements. Earlier in the evening, two episodes of ABC's ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' (7.87 million, then 13.2 million) were on the low end of the ratings for the sob-inducing home show, but they still dominated their time slots among 18-to-49 year-olds in Nielsen's estimates. The 8 p.m. ''Home'' beat a new episode of CBS's ''Cold Case'' (12.23 million), Fox's ''Simpsons'' (7.83 million) and a ''Loop'' rerun (5.73 million), and NBC's ''West Wing'' (7.31 million). That political drama, once formidable in the ratings, ended the Election Day episode with Annabeth (Kristin Chenoweth) walking into Leo's room, presumably to find him collapsed. Leo, the vice presidential candidate, was played by John Spencer, who died of a heart attack in December; next week's ''West Wing'' will deal with the death of the character. KATE AURTHUR"

After a courageous struggle with pulmonary fibrosis, Daryl passed away peacefully at his West Vancouver home on October 21, 2006. Born March 8, 1929 in Vancouver, Daryl's love of British Columbia never waned even while he wandered the world. The smell of the ocean, the changing of the tide, but most importantly watching the setting of the sun on British Columbia's Pacific coast were very much part of his persona, especially when he was on his Savary Island -a place he came to think of as ''home''. From selling jokes to a local radio station at the age of 15, he earnestly set out to capture his '' love with shadows, phantoms, lovely ghosts, and haunting the byways of our hearts after he obtained a degree in English and Philosophy from the University of British Columbia. He has worked for the National Film Board, the CBC, ABC, NBC and CBS, and most of the major studios in Hollywood. He has also been the recipient of many accolades and awards -Emmy Award for his direction of ''The Day the Lion Died'' starring Hal Holbrook, the National Society of Film Critics Special Award for his feature film ''Payday'' starring Rip Torn, a Christopher Award for ''I Heard the Owl Call My Name'' starring British actor Tom Courtenay, the Canadian Film Awards (now called the Genies) for ''The Silent Partner'' starring Christopher Plummer, Elliott Gould and Susannah York. Daryl's feature film ''Payday'' was also an official entry at the Cannes Film Festival in the Directors' Fortnight Category. He received Emmy and Directors Guild of America nominations for his work on the mini-series ''The Thorn Birds.'' He co-founded and launched the independent station CKVU-TV in Vancouver and was its first President and CEO. He was inducted into the ''Starwalk'' and the B.C. Entertainment Hall of Fame at Vancouver's Orpheum Theatre. He was also the first recipient of the Outstanding Achievement Award for an Individual given at the British Columbia Film Industry's annual Leo Awards ceremony. Daryl was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcast Hall of Fame. Simon Fraser University granted him a Honourary Doctorate of Fine Arts, and he also received ACTRA's John Drainie Award for distinguished contribution to broadcasting. ''Though the lamps should be lit and fires started I stay watching the darkness come slowly forward. I think of how few nights of peace there are. True peace. When the flood tide slides north as it should. When the eagle sits in his tree. When the heron puts away the torn cloth of his cries. When night falls and the heart is not heavy''. Daryl has lived his life with enthusiasm, spirit and an intensely enquiring mind. He is survived by his wife Anne-Marie Dekker, sons Bryan (Margy) and David (Melanie), stepson Michael Favelle (Carrie) and grandchildren Leah, Nathan, Samantha, Dakota, Ansel, Owen, Elijah, Noah, and Jakob. A public service will be held on Tuesday, November 7 at 2pm at Christ Church Cathedral, 690 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC. Condolences or well wishes may be posted at www.darylduke.com.

The clear winner though was ABC. From 9 p.m. to 11, its season finale of ''Grey's Anatomy'' was broadcast intact. Denny (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) died after a seemingly successful heart transplant, and a grieving Izzie (Katherine Heigl) quit being a surgeon as a result.

Between the president's speech and the ''Grey'' broadcast on a Monday (in addition to its Sunday episode), the usual order of things was upended. CBS, which is normally No. 1 among total viewers, placed third, as an extended ''Deal or No Deal'' put NBC into second place. And Fox, which featured the great escape by the ''Prison Break'' gang, was third among adults 18 to 49, also behind NBC. KATE AURTHUR"

Was it meant to caution them about the image of a disembodied eyeball? Or the autopsied internal organs infected by flesh-eating bacteria? Maybe it was the flashback of a woman gnawing at her own hand to free herself from chains? Hard to say, really. But ''CSI'' was Thursday's most-watched show, as it nearly always is, with 27.08 million viewers, according to Nielsen estimates. Though ABC's ''Dancing With the Stars'' edged out CBS's ''Survivor'' among total viewers at 8 p.m. (19.1 million versus 18.87 million), CBS won this sweeps Thursday over all. Noah Wyle's brief, practically minuscule, appearance on ''E.R.'' (14.15 million) helped NBC place second among 18-to-49-year-olds. Also of note was Fox's ''O.C.'' at 9 p.m., which drew a meager 5.26 million viewers and finished fourth among adults 18 to 49.

But CBS started fresh on Monday, and was the clear winner in what was otherwise a close night among Fox, ABC and NBC. Its victory was thanks to ''Two and a Half Men'' (an estimated 17.28 million viewers) and ''CSI: Miami'' (18 million), which lifted the rest of the schedule in total viewers and adults 18 to 49. The news on Monday, though, was that NBC's much-hyped new lineup had only one winner: the return of the game show ''Deal or No Deal'' (13.46 million) beat all of its competition at 8 p.m. But the season premiere of ''The Apprentice,'' starring Donald Trump, above, squandered that lead, drawing only 9.76 million viewers and placing fourth in the hour in the 18-to-49 demographic. ''The Apprentice'' performed poorly, compared with ''Las Vegas,'' which used to occupy that hour but has been moved to Fridays. And NBC's ''Medium'' suffered from its weakened lead-in, drawing only 10.42 million viewers. ''Medium,'' the Patricia Arquette psychic drama, was beaten easily by the second hour of ABC's ''Bachelor'' finale (11.5 million viewers over all), in which Dr. Travis Stork chose the good girl, Sarah Stone, after the bad girl, Moana Dixon, acted like a jerk in front of his family.

After a courageous struggle with pulmonary fibrosis, Daryl passed away peacefully at his West Vancouver home on October 21, 2006. Born March 8, 1929 in Vancouver, Daryl's love of British Columbia never waned even while he wandered the world. The smell of the ocean, the changing of the tide, but most importantly watching the setting of the sun on British Columbia's Pacific coast were very much part of his persona, especially when he was on his Savary Island -a place he came to think of as ''home''. From selling jokes to a local radio station at the age of 15, he earnestly set out to capture his '' love with shadows, phantoms, lovely ghosts, and haunting the byways of our hearts after he obtained a degree in English and Philosophy from the University of British columbia. He has worked for the National Film board, the CBC, aBC, NBC and CBS, and most of the major studios in Hollywood. He has also been the recipient of many accolades and awards -Emmy Award for his direction of ''The Day the Lion Died'' starring Hal Holbrook, the National Society of Film Critics Special Award for his feature film ''payday'' starring Rip Torn, a Christopher Award for ''I Heard the Owl Call My Name'' starring British actor Tom Courtenay, the Canadian Film Awards (now called the Genies) for ''The Silent Partner'' starring Christopher Plummer, Elliott Gould and Susannah York. Daryl's feature film ''Payday'' was also an official entry at the Cannes Film Festival in the Directors' Fortnight Category. He received Emmy and Directors Guild of America nomination for his work on the mini-series ''The Thorn Birds.'' He co-founded and launched the independent station CKVU-TV in Vancouver and was its first President and CEO. He was inducted into the '' Starwalk '' and the B.C. Entertainment Hall of Fame at Vancouvers Orpheum Theatre. He was also the first recipient of the Outstanding Achievement Award for an Individual given at the British Columbia Film Industry's annual Leo Awards ceremony. Daryl was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcast Hall of Fame. Simon Fraser University granted him a Honourary Doctorate of Fine Arts, and he also received ACTRA's John Drainie Award for distinguished contribution to broadcasting. ''Though the lamps should be lit and fires started I stay watching the darkness come slowly forward. I think of how few nights of peace there are. True peace. When the flood tide slides north as it should. When the eagle sits in his tree. When the heron puts away the torn cloth of his cries. When night falls and the heart is not heavy''. Daryl has lived his life with enthusiasm, spirit and an intensely enquiring mind. He is survived by his wife Anne-Marie Dekker, sons Bryan (Margy) and David (Melanie), stepson Michael Favelle (Carrie) and grandchildren Leah, Nathan, Samantha, Dakota, Ansel, Owen, Elijah, Noah, and Jakob. A public service will be held on Tuesday, November 7 at 2pm at Christ Church Cathedral, 690 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC. Condolences or well wishes may be posted at www.darylduke.com.

The half-hour ''Idol'' drew an estimated 26.9 million viewers and lifted Fox to a victory. But more important, Fox's strong 18-to-49 ratings for Wednesday brought it to a tie with ABC in that demographic for the season over all. Last season ''Idol'' and the World Series delivered Fox a win in that age group, which advertisers care about the most. This season the network will also get a boost from ''24,'' ''House,'' ''Prison Break'' and ''Bones.'' ABC, Fox's competitor for 18-to-49-year-olds, broadcast the return of the soon-to-end ''Alias'' on Wednesday. The spy drama, in which Sydney (Jennifer Garner) had a baby girl, and viewers saw that Vaughn (Michael Vartan) is living among monks in Bhutan, drew 7.54 million viewers over two hours.

The show, at 10 p.m. Eastern and Pacific times, drew 19 million viewers, according to Nielsen's estimates, and capped another Thursday victory for CBS in total viewers and among adults 18 to 49. It was preceded by ''Survivor'' at 8 p.m. (17.2 million) and ''CSI'' (26.7 million), which ended with Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) being shot in the chest. NBC's second-place lineup featured the season finales of ''My Name Is Earl'' (9.2 million) and ''The Office'' (7.4 million) in 41-minute ''supersized'' versions, the format the network often used for ''Friends'' back when it was No. 1 on Thursdays. Though ''Earl'' drew more viewers, ''The Office'' retained a large percentage of its 18-to-49 audience.

In an interview, Mr. Bass said he had not chosen to disclose his sexuality earlier because he did not want to affect the popularity of the group, known for a string of hits including ''Bye Bye Bye'' and ''It's Gonna Be Me. ''I'm more liberated and happy than I've been my whole life,'' he told the magazine. 'Da Vinci Code' Banned Dan Brown's ''Da Vinci Code'' has been banned in Iran after protests by Christian clergymen, the BBC reported. Though no new copies will be printed, the eight previous editions of the book, in translation, will remain in stores. Those who took issue with the book object to its plot, which relies on a theory that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and that their descendants survive today. Iran, a nation of 69 million Muslims, is also home to about 100,000 Christians. New Morning Team ABC News yesterday announced a new team for ''Good Morning America'' as it takes the measure of a morning-show landscape being remade by the departures of Charles Gibson (from ''Good Morning America''') and Katie Couric (from ''Today''), and soon to feature Meredith Vieira (Ms. Couric's replacement). Jim Murphy, who served as executive producer of the ''CBS Evening News'' for six years until last year, becomes senior executive producer of ''Good Morning America.'' Tom Cibrowski, who joined ''Good Morning America'' four years ago, becomes executive producer, reporting to Mr. Murphy. Ben Sherwood, who has been executive producer since 2004, announced last month that he would leave the program later this year and was moving back to Los Angeles. New Opera, Old Lovers Although there are many theories about who actually wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare, most historians seem to agree that there are some lost years in the historical record, leading to much speculation about what he was doing from 1584 to 1592. A new opera, ''William,'' scheduled to open last night at Vadstena Castle in Sweden, posits that he might have spent those years in a romantic relationship with the playwright Christopher Marlowe. According to the theater's Web site, the opera is ''a thrilling tale of love, power, espionage, counterfeit and jealousy in a 16th-century subculture.'' ''William'' was written in Swedish, with text by Hakan Lindquist and a score by Tommy Andersson. All Those Awards For the second year, the actor, playwright, novelist and drag performer Charles Busch (''The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,'' ''Die, Mommy, Die!'') will be the host of the New York Innovative Theater Awards, honoring achievement in Off Off Broadway theater, to be presented on Sept. 18. This year's nominees, chosen by a system that polls both audience members and appointed judges, were announced last week at a party in the East Village. Mr. Busch, right, was the host at the inaugural awards ceremony last year and wanted to do it again because he ''thought it was fascinating,'' he said in a telephone interview (during which he fumbled with a new cellphone that he thought might be taking pictures of his ear). ''I think it's an important thing that they're doing,'' he said, ''and I like that it encompasses a wide range of people who are working Off Off Broadway.'' Last year, the group used the Lucille Lortel Theater for the presentation, but, in an indication of interest in the awards, it is looking for a bigger location this time. Presenters include the playwrights Lanford Wilson and Lisa Kron (''Well''). The actor and rapper Will Smith will be honored by the Museum of the Moving Image on Dec. 3 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan. In announcing his selection as this year's honoree, the chairman of the board of trustees, Herbert Schlosser, described Mr. Smith as ''a man of diverse successes.'' Previous honorees include Sidney Lumet, Elia Kazan and James Stewart. Stevie Wonder will receive a lifetime achievement award at an Oct. 17 presentation of the National Civil Rights Museum's 2006 Freedom Awards in Memphis. Also being presented are the International Freedom Award, to Bernard Kouchner, the physician and former minister of health for France who started the nonprofit Doctors Without Borders, and the National Freedom Award, to Joseph Lowery, a founder of both the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Black Leadership Forum. News From the Stage Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg's epic musical ''The Pirate Queen'' has a place and a time: previews are scheduled to begin Feb. 23 at the Hilton Theater, with an opening set for March 22. Frank Galati will direct a cast of 39. Among the former cast members of ''Chicago'' who are coming back for the 10th-anniversary performance on Nov. 14 are Melanie Griffith, Brooke Shields, Wayne Brady, Patrick Swayze, Marilu Henner, Huey Lewis, Gregory Harrison and Alan Thicke. Amy Irving and Jason Butler Harner have joined the cast of Tom Stoppard's ''Coast of Utopia,'' to be presented by Lincoln Center Theater this fall. Mr. Harner (''The Paris Letter'') will portray the novelist Ivan Turgenev, and Ms. Irving, recently seen Off Broadway in ''A Safe Harbour for Elizabeth Bishop,'' will play two roles."

By the late 1950s and early 1960s, Tennessee's Dolly Parton had burst on the scene as a bubbly teenage country singer while Detroit's William Robinson Jr., as Smokey Robinson, had crooned his way onto the radio with a smooth style and soulful lyrics -- and nearly a half century later both are still building musical legacies. On Sunday, Ms. Parton, Mr. Robinson, the conductor Zubin Mehta, the musical theater composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and the filmmaker Steven Spielberg were recognized for their lifetime contributions to the arts at the Kennedy Center Honors here."

In a brief hearing in High Court in London, his lawyer, Nigel Tait, said, ''The articles falsely alleged that Sir Elton issued a bizarre and absurd edict to guests'' not to approach him, ''thereby acting like old-fashioned royalty or some tin-pot dictator and exhibiting self-important, arrogant and rude behavior bordering on paranoia.'' He said that the assertions ''caused Sir Elton considerable embarrassment and distress,'' and that the newspaper had issued a prompt apology and agreed to substantial damages. He added that Sir Elton intended to donate the award to the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

Computer security researchers and hackers have begun to find potentially serious flaws in the system, which was released to corporate customers late last month. [Page C1.] AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR H.P. Hewlett-Packard's turnaround was confirmed this year when profit from PCs and corporate servers and storage devices nearly doubled from a year earlier, allowing it to lay claim to the title of the world's largest technology company. Now it has to sustain those gains, and that means it must add about $5.5 billion a year in new revenue, or about what Yahoo produces each year in total revenue. [C1.] BRIEF AFFAIR FOR TELENOVELAS Ardor for the telenovela, the steamy low-budget soap opera genre that has become the staple of television programming in Spanish-speaking countries, has apparently cooled. In the last 12 months, news reports revealed that CBS was working on as many as seven scripts for telenovelas, that ABC had invested in as many as 45 existing telenovela storylines, and NBC was jumping in to adapt telenovelas already produced by Telemundo. But not a single telenovela project has been put into production by any of those networks. [C1.] ONLINE AD PRICES RISING Prices for some online advertising are going up, and some retailers, like Matt Coffin, left, president of LowerMyBills.com, and brand marketers wonder if publishers will be so emboldened by a strong advertising market that they will raise the prices of ads sharply. E-Commerce Report. [C4.] R.I.M. SILENT ON OPTIONS REVIEW In an investor conference call last week, the chairman of Research In Motion, the Canadian company that created the BlackBerry, had plenty of cheery news about sales and profits. But he had no comment on the review of R.I.M.'s past stock options grants, which was undertaken in late September. The company has given few details on the review to investors or regulators, making it difficult to assess its potential impact or full extent. [C1.] SPREADING THE WORD DIGITALLY Word-of-mouth advertising -- sharing information with friends, relatives and colleagues to propagate interest in a company or product -- has been around for decades, but with the advent of the Internet, it has taken on new life. Companies are using online message boards and chats to get the word out for little or no cash investment. [C3.] A STATION KEEPS AIR AMERICA While negotiations to buy the beleaguered radio network Air America have kept its future in a state of limbo, the company had one bit of good news last week. WXXM-FM, a station in Madison, Wis., owned by Clear Channel Communications, rescinded a decision to drop the liberal network in favor of Fox Sports Radio. [C6.] IN DEFENSE OF PLASMA Panasonic, the consumer electronics company, is the world's biggest seller of plasma TVs and has long promoted the benefits of that technology compared to liquid-crystal display, another flat-panel TV product, even though it also sells a full lineup of L.C.D. sets. But the company says it believes that plasma technology is under unfair attack from its competitors.

Cheap stunts, or strokes of marketing genius? It may be too soon to tell, but the allure of odd venues -- to advertisers, at least -- has a long history.

Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punchline. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Beginning Tuesday, Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street; (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) 'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) * 'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway AVALON' Glory Sims Bowen's retelling of the Camelot legend from the women's point of view is entertaining but too long and uncertain in tone. The comic moments work better than the earnest ones (2:20). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Anita Gates) 'A BITTER TASTE' When an academic gets too close to one of his case studies, his mistake haunts him in this twisty, acid drama about repression, friendship and the intersection between sex and power (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman) 'ELLIOT, A SOLDIER'S FUGUE' True to its title, ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue'' is composed like a fugue, with several narrative strands playing in point and counterpoint around one theme: a soldier's experience of war. The play, by Quiara Alegria Hudes, traces the legacy of war through three generations of a Puerto Rican family, and without invoking current politics, manages to indict the war in Iraq (1:10). 45 Below at the Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban) 'GIRL IN HEAT' Nelson Avidon's predictable dramedy about Joseph, a randy lawyer, and Marilyn, a flirtatious office temp, is salvaged to some extent by the play's two performers. As their characters reveal themselves uneasily, Mr. Avidon and Cheryl Leibert make the struggle believable (1:20). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens) 'LENNY & LOU' This black comedy by Ian Cohen about two brothers and their foul-mouthed, demented mother has the right ingredients for shock theater: four-letter words, sex talk, sex acts. But it somehow doesn't shock (2:15). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444. (Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200.

Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100.

The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'APARTMENT 3A' Jeff Daniels's romance about a woman who lost her faith is written with wit, conviction and a real affection for its characters (1:30). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street; (212) 352-0255; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'BURIED CHILD' Sam Shepard's dark and sometimes funny portrait of a dysfunctional Midwestern family doesn't translate successfully into the bright colors of Norman Rockwell Americana. The director, Cyndy A. Marion, and her White Horse Theater Company did much better a year ago with a production of another Shepard play about family, ''The Late Henry Moss,'' which was full of mystery and emotion (2:40). The American Theater of Actors, Sargent Theater, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Stevens) 'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'SAFETY' A cynical, contrived portrayal of the life of a war photographer that attacks its subject with a heavy hand (1:25). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'COWBOY DEL AMOR' (No rating, 86 minutes, in English and Spanish) For 16 years, Ivan Thompson, a self-styled 'Cowboy Cupid,' has been supporting himself by helping disenchanted American men meet hopeful Mexican women. Directed by Michèle Ohayon with an attentive ear for the regressive attitudes beneath the humor, ''Cowboy Del Amor'' is a slyly insightful portrait of conflicting expectations in the search for the perfect partner. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) 'A GOOD WOMAN' (R, 93 minutes) This loose adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 1892 comedy, ''Lady Windermere's Fan,'' moves it out of the drawing room, and out of England to the Italian Riviera in 1930, casting as its leads two American actors (Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson) who have no feel for Wilde's high-toned repartee: fatal mistakes all. (Holden) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) 'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'THROUGH THE FIRE' (No rating, 103 minutes) Jonathan Hock's unwaveringly upbeat documentary follows the basketball sensation Sebastian Telfair, a senior at Lincoln High School in Coney Island, as he chooses between the University of Louisville and the N.B.A. Yet behind the cheering and popping flashbulbs lurks another, much darker movie, one that questions the relationship between sneaker manufacturers and financially deprived kids with exceptional talent. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series ANOTHER SPANISH CINEMA: FILM IN CATALUNYA 1906-2006 (Through Tuesday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Catalán film continues this weekend with screenings including Pere Portabella's ''Warsaw Bridge'' (1989), three parallel stories set all over Barcelona; Agusti Villaronga's ''In a Glass Cage'' (1987), a drama about depravity that the American director John Waters has said he found shocking; and ''Fausto 5.0'' (2001), the Catalán theater group La Fura dels Baus's interpretation of Goethe's ''Faust.'' Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year.

(Gates) FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program honoring Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82) continues this weekend with ''Effi Briest'' (1974), starring Hanna Schygulla as a 19th-century teenager who marries an older man. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Sunday) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. The series ends this weekend with five films, including Stephen Frears's 1985 comic drama, ''My Beautiful Laundrette,'' selected by Gene Seymour, about two young men who go into business together and fall in love; and Roko Belic's ''Genghis Blues'' (1999), selected by Lisa Schwarzbaum, a documentary about a blind American blues musician who teaches himself throat-singing. 36-01 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) PRIX JEAN VIGO (Through Dec. 30) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with a series of 41 films from directors who have won the prize that bears his name. The first weekend's films include ''Don't Forget You're Going to Die'' (1995), Xavier Beauvois's tale of a student who is told he's not long for this world; ''The Gardener'' (1980), Jean-Pierre Sentier's absurdist fairy tale set at a factory; and Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 New Wave classic, ''Breathless.'' 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10.

(Jon Pareles) BISHOP ALLEN (Tonight) The indie pop outfit Bishop Allen is in the spotlight lately for its frontman Justin Rice's leading-man turn in Andrew Bujalski's film ''Mutual Appreciation.'' In it he plays to a receptive but sparse Brooklyn crowd. His own band has a slightly larger following. 9:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $8. (Laura Sinagra) LAURA CANTRELL (Tonight) This singer, guitarist and songwriter has a deep alt-country résumé that includes an old-timey country radio show on WFMU (91.1 FM) and real Southern roots. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 7:30, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near East Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $15. (Sinagra) CELEBRATION (Thursday) Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. This bill also includes Hong Kong and Baby Shakes. 9 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra) ELECTRIC SIX, SHE WANTS REVENGE (Tomorrow, Sunday and Monday) The Detroit garage rockers Electric Six broke out of the pack by virtue of the singer Dick Valentine's mania on songs like ''Danger! High Voltage.'' The band's new album, ''Senor Smoke,'' is less compelling, but features the timely apocalyptic rumination ''Jimmy Carter.'' She Wants Revenge plays post-punk in the dark Interpol style. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door (both days sold out); Monday at 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $13 (sold out). (Sinagra) FEIST, JASON COLLETT, MATES OF STATE (Tonight) The Canadian bohemian Leslie Feist is good at affecting a Continental, beer-hall gloom, but her best cabaret-pop songs are quirky jazz numbers; she sounds like a hipper Norah Jones. Jason Collett makes loud music with the Broken Social Scene collective, and softer music on his own. The indie-pop duo Mates of State open. 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 (sold out). (Sinagra) DIAMANDA GALAS (Tuesday) Putting the demon in demonstrative, the vocalist and pianist Diamanda Galás uses love's biggest commercial holiday as an excuse to mine the dread and catharsis from romance-related original songs and covers of some classics. 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $20. (Sinagra) JESSE HARRIS (Monday) In preparation for the release of his album ''Mineral'' (Secret Sun), this singer-songwriter and Norah Jones collaborator will play a regular Monday night residency for the month. His new material recalls the rootsy but ethereal mood of Paul Simon's early albums, with lyrics evoking more dreamy ennui than solitary pathos. He has assembled a new band to accompany him. 10 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; no cover. (Sinagra) IL DIVO (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the tradition of the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, this pop quartet was formed after a two-year search. It goes the international route, with its American, French, Swiss and Spanish members. The group covers Toni Braxton's ''Unbreak My Heart.'' 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 247-4777; $49.50 to $79.50. (Sinagra) IN FLAMES, TRIVIUM (Thursday) Sweden's In Flames continues to explore the possibilities of bite-size metal blasts. Trivium specializes in orchestrated guitar and percussion pileups. Zao and Devildriver also play. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $24 at the door. (Sinagra) INXS (Sunday and Monday) Reality TV has provided this 1980's rock band from Australia with a replacement for its deceased frontman, Michael Hutchence.

He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences.

This Staten Island crew created a secret code that mixed Kung-fu arcana and Five-Percenter cosmology. Its most deliciously unpredictable member, Old Dirty Bastard, is gone, but the group has reconvened for its first tour since 2004, boasting the talents of the thug-turned-comedian Method Man; the master atmospheric producer RZA; the eloquent GZA and Raekwon; and the excitable absurdist Ghostface Killah. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-7740; $44.

(Kozinn) STAATSKAPELLE BERLIN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Daniel Barenboim reminds New York that he has an orchestra other than the Chicago Symphony. Conducting Germany's oldest orchestra, which he has led for more than a decade, he celebrates this year's birthday boy, Mozart, with two programs, each with two symphonies and a piano concerto in E-flat. Tomorrow's concerto is for two pianos; joining Mr. Barenboim will be Radu Lupu. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 2, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38 to $130. (Midgette) ST.

(Eichler) 'VOICES OF LIGHT' (Thursday) Richard Einhorn composed this vivid, unusual oratorio as a soundtrack for Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic ''The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' a compressed telling of Joan of Arc's trial by an ecclesiastical court and her execution at the stake. His texts draw on the Bible, Joan's letters, the works of Hildegard of Bingen and other medieval churchwomen, and ''The Vices of Women,'' a 13th-century misogynistic ballad; his music pivots between the medieval world and ours. During a screening of the film, it is to be performed live by the Ensemble Sospeso, the New Amsterdam Singers and Anonymous 4, which assembles only for special projects these days. 8 p.m., World Financial Center, West Street, South of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * RICHARD ALSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday through Feb. 19) The choreographer Richard Alston has been a mainstay of English contemporary dance since the early 1970's, and his musical, often understated work is always worth watching. This program presents three dances new to New York audiences: ''Fever,'' to Monteverdi; ''Such Longing,'' to Chopin's Nocturnes and Études; and ''Gypsy Mixture,'' from the delightfully titled CD ''Electric Gypsyland.'' Tuesday through Feb. 18 at 8 p.m., Feb. 19 at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $38. (Roslyn Sulcas) * RONALD K.

(Dunning) * GINA GIBNEY DANCE (Thursday) Ms. Gibney explores the worlds of finite reality and the unknowable, and she has made a third new world of them in her mysterious, subtle ''unbounded.'' (Through Feb. 19.) 8:30 p.m. Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15.

(Through Feb. 19.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 5 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.TheaterMania.com; $20 to $25.(Erika Kinetz) HEATHER KRAVAS (Tonight and tomorrow night) What promises to be a lively, internationally flavored double bill, with a three-year, long-distance collaboration between Heather Kravas from New York and Antonija Livingstone from Montreal by way of Berlin, and a duet from PO.V.S., a dance collective from Moscow. 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $12 and $20. (Rockwell) METRO MOVEMENT PROJECT (Tonight and tomorrow night) In ''Modern Dance: Primitive Lights,'' dance by choreographers including Meg Brooker, Claire Elizabeth Barratt, Mark Lamb, Wendy Blum and Vong Phrommala will be presented in four programs, all performed in candlelight in a church setting, to live music and the spoken word. 7 and 9, Metro Baptist Church, 410 West 40th Street, Clinton, (917) 279-1941; $15; $7 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * THE NETA DANCE COMPANY A.W.A.R.D. SHOW (Sunday) This free monthly performance series organized and produced by the choreographer Neta Pulvermacher began in January and runs until May. It's a great idea -- each event presents work by four emerging or midcareer choreographers, then opens up discussion between the artists and the audience. Later everyone has a drink. Melinda Ring, Pele Bauch, Barbara Duffy and the wonderful Keigwin & Company are on the lineup, and Thomas DeFrantz will moderate the discussion. Call first -- the Joyce SoHo had to turn people away last time. 7 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479 or www.joyce.org. (Sulcas) NEW CHAMBER BALLET (Tomorrow) Choreography by Miro Magloire, the company's director, and Deborah Lohse and Constantine Baecher will be performed by dancers including Deborah Wingert. 8 p.m., City Center Studio 4, 130 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444 or www.smartix.com; $15; $10 for students with ID. and ages 65+ (Dunning) NEW YORK FLAMENCO FESTIVAL 2006 (Tomorrow through Feb. 19) The city's annual celebration of all things Flamenco continues into its second week tomorrow night with the guitarist Vicente Amigo and an ensemble that includes the dancer Rafael Campallo. A gala on Wednesday night lines up some of flamenco's big guns, including the legendary Manolo Marin and Soledad Barrio, often seen in New York with Noche Flamenca. On Thursday, the Nuevo Ballet Español shows flamenco in a more contemporary guise -- a slightly doubtful enterprise -- featuring the wonderful Lola Greco. Various locations; for information: (212) 545-7536 or www.worldmusicinstitute.org/wmical/Main.asp (Sulcas) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow through Feb. 19) This 12-year-old festival has a noteworthy lineup over its second week. WilliamsWorks, a new troupe directed by a former New York City Ballet dancer, Todd Williams, gives its final performances this weekend (tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.), and the Tel Aviv-based Sally-Anne Friedland Dance Drama Company makes its United States debut. In her world premiere of ''Borders'' and the American premiere of ''Red,'' we are promised that ''the abstraction of dance meets the drama of life'' (Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Feb. 18 at 8 p.m.; Feb. 19 at 2 and 7 p.m.) Ailey Citigroup Theater, Joan Weill Center for Dance, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; students and 62+, $15. (Sulcas) * STARS OF THE 21ST CENTURY (Monday) Cheesy but usually amusing and sometimes thrilling, these potpourris of dancers from hither and yon, performing to recorded music and offering sometimes challenging choreography but mostly flashy showpieces, are always worth a visit. This year the galaxy, many returning from previous galas, includes Irina Dvorovenko and her husband, Maxim Beloserkovsky, from American Ballet Theater; Sofiane Sylve from the New York City Ballet; Svetlana Lunkina and Sergei Filin from the Bolshoi Ballet; Andrian Fadeyev from the Kirov Ballet; Mathilde Froustey and Emmanuel Thibault from the Paris Opera Ballet; Lucia Lacarra and Cyril Pierre from the Munich Ballet; Pilar Alvarez and Claudio Hoffmann from Tango Metropolis Argentina; and Desmond Richardson from Complexions. 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or (212) 721-6500; $20 to $150. (Rockwell) THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday) This year's Pow-Wow, the company's 31st, includes dances, stories and traditional music from the Iroquois and American Indians of the Northwest Coast, the Southwest, the Plains and the Arctic regions. (Repeated next weekend.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109 and www.theaterforthenewcity.net. Evening performances: $10. Matinees: $10; $1 for children under 12 accompanied by a ticketholding adult. (Dunning) THE WALDEN COMPANY (Sunday) A new musical, ''All is Full of Love,'' by the choreographer Josh Walden, is based on the narrative of ''On the Town,'' but set to the music of Bjork. The one-time performance (presumably Mr. Walden is hoping for more) partly benefits Dancers Responding to AIDS. 8 p.m., Theater at St. Clements, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101 or TheaterMania.com; $39.90 to $81.50 (includes preshow reception). (Sulcas) * REGGIE WILSON/FIST & HEEL PERFORMANCE GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Wilson and his superb musicians and dancers create a world that fuses the cultural traditions of the black American South, urban America, Africa and the Caribbean, this time in ''The Tale: Npinpee Nckutchie and the Tail of the Golden Dek,'' a new work that explores sexual attraction. (Through Feb. 18 and Feb. 22 to 25.) 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces which the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and commerce,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639(Johnson) Galleries: Uptown * Ellen Brooks: Vintage Photographs from the 70's Cultural wars have come and gone -- actually, they've never really gone -- since 1976, when Ellen Brooks first showed a dozen larger-than-life-size studio photographs of nude male and female adolescents. Eight more pictures, never before exhibited, from the same series are on view at Roth, and it is easy to see how, in the right (meaning wrong) setting, they could still cause a fuss today. The inclusion of documentation, including early reviews of the work, give these remarkable pictures a historical context. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through Feb. 18. (Cotter) The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter) Galleries: 57th Street * Maria Elena González This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. González encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter) * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Ken Johnson) JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'NOW' As a pendant to the photographer's survey at the Museum of Modern art, this show focuses on images of the land and outbuildings on his upstate farm, with special attention to the seasonal changes and akimbo branches of numerous apple trees. Pace/MacGill Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999, through Feb. 18. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea WILLIE COLE: SOLE TO SOUL An adept recycler of found objects used as tools or in assemblages to evoke different varieties of African sculpture, Mr. Cole has expanded both palette and references in his latest efforts. Here women's high heels, arranged by hue, handsomely evoke rose windows, mandalas and lotus flowers, as well as religious multiplicity (Smith). Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 367-7474, through Feb. 18. (Smith) Molly Davies This expansive show features major works from three decades by a veteran avant-gardist film and video maker. Ranging from near-abstraction to dreamlike allegory, the video installations of Ms. Davies call to mind artists as various as Gary Hill and Bill Viola. Some involve collaboration with musicians and dancers, and the esteemed poet Anne Carson stars in a sensuous and stately three-screen production from 2002 called ''Desire.'' Zone, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2177, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) ERWIN OLAF The large, carefully staged photographs of people in midcentury American clothes and environments by this successful Dutch commercial photographer look like the dreams of a deeply depressed Norman Rockwell. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) Wu Jian'an: 'Daydreams' Trained in the art of paper cutting, this young Chinese artist scissors swirling, wonderfully intricate and fantastic compositions of figures, body parts and animals from single large sheets of white paper. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, (212) 414-1169, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo 'It's a Beautiful Day' Sweet but with an acid center, this group show includes Mie Yim's smudgy painting of stuffed animals in an overripe landscape; Charlene Liu's pale watercolor vision of wrecked cars in an overgrown valley; Satoru Eguchi's architectural photographs cut into lacy patterns; Margaret Lee's watercolor pictures of rock formations with graffiti carved into them; Saeko Takagi's pastel-colored paintings of wan, blond models; Misaki Kawai's funky, storytelling marine sculptures; and Koji Shimizu's sculpture in the form of climbing equipment for cats. ISE Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-1649, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Other Galleries Carla Accardi and Lucio Fontana,: 'Infinite Space' Bridging the gap between higher metaphysics and raw materialism in Italy in the 1960's and 70's, Fontana famously made single-color canvases that he decisively slashed or punctured, while Accardi wrapped strips of painted transparent plastic around wooden stretchers or painted fields of optically vibrating calligraphy. A selection of works by both artists makes for a surprisingly handsome and elegant show that is nicely complemented by a small installation ofrecent works by Richard Tuttle in the project room. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) Last Chance MARIA MAGDALENA CAMPOS-PONS: backyard dreams See this show for the large, gorgeously colored multiphoto works in which drawing, painting and photography merge with intimations of the female, otherness and a distinctly tropical locale. Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-2410; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'DAVID HAMMONS: THE UNAUTHORIZED RETROSPECTIVE' How do you do a show if you don't have art? Use copies. How do you get copies? Find photographs of the original art. That's what Triple Candie has done with David Hammons's work. The gallery photocopied illustrations of existing, or once existing, Hammons pieces from books and magazines and downloaded others from the Internet. They then taped the 81/2 -by-11 prints to the gallery wall. The result: a homage that is very much in this important artist's maverick, dematerialized spirit. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783; closes Sunday.(Cotter) * Warren Isensee Could this be Mr. Isensee's breakout show? His glowing grid, striped and concentric rectangle paintings play adroitly with conventions of Modernist abstraction and are almost hallucinogenically beautiful. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 223-2227; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) CHRISTOPHER MINER: HOW BEAUTIFUL HEAVEN MUST BE In this split-personality debut, the artist mimics a drunken black man in one video, and in another, takes a remorseful, memory-laden tour of his dead grandparents' house. The prevailing impression is of white, male, not necessarily Southern emptiness and disconnection. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few.

Born in Brooklyn, New York on July 25, 1918, he did not begin to study music until he was thirteen, while at Brooklyn's Tilden High School. Young Albert was a natural. In 1938, just nineteen years old, he was invited to join the New York Philharmonic by then music director Sir John Barbirolli, who heard him play chamber music at a party. Just before that, he had won a scholarship to Julliard as well as the Gabrilowitch Memorial Scholarship of the National Orchestral Association. He studied with Philharmonic musicians Engelbert Brenner, Bruno Labate and Michael Nazzi. Mr. Goltzer was so young he lied about his age so he could sign his contract with the orchestra. Mr. Goltzer took a leave of absence to serve in the military during World War II. In 1946, he assumed the position of solo oboist with the St. Louis Symphony. After his stay in St. Louis, he was solo oboe with the CBS Symphony and the WOR Orchestra, and a member of the New York Woodwind Quintet. In 1955, Mr. Goltzer was invited back to the New York Philharmonic by Dimitri Metropolis, where he played until 1984 as associate principal. Albert Goltzer made numerous recordings and was on the faculties of the Julliard, Mannes and Manhattan Schools of Music. He is survived by his beloved wife, Doris, an accomplished orchestral musician currently with the New York City Opera, son George and George's wife, Barbara Gertel Goltzer, son Seth, brother-in-law Alvin Delman, and grandchildren Andrew, Jill, Samantha and Adam.

But the added publicity failed to stem the show's ratings slide in its season debut Thursday night at 8. According to Nielsen estimates, it drew 17.7 million viewers -- easily the best of the night, but among viewers 18 to 49 years old, it was down 10 percent from the debut of ''Survivor: Panama'' in February and down 5 percent from the start of ''Survivor: Guatemala'' last fall. Against that competition, audiences shrank for week two of Fox's new comedies. Brad Garrett's '' 'Til Death'' (6.3 million), at 8, and ''Happy Hour'' (5.3 million), at 8:30, were both down significantly from their premieres last week: '' 'Til Death'' lost 23 percent of its audience in the 18-to-49 segment, and ''Happy Hour'' lost 13 percent. Fox was third for the hour, behind CBS and ABC, which ran the first of two repeats of ''Grey's Anatomy'' (7.4 million).

CBS finished second and Fox finished third, with both networks benefiting from overruns of their own football coverage from the afternoon that extended well into the 7 p.m. hour. Following CBS's football overrun of approximately 45 minutes, the network broadcast new episodes of ''60 Minutes'' and ''The Amazing Race,'' giving it an average of 11 million viewers from 7 to 10 p.m. ABC tied Fox for third on the night in total viewers while finishing a distant fourth among adults 18 to 49.

Its ''60 Minutes,'' which featured a segment about the Olympian Bode Miller and the problems of drunken skiing, drew high ratings, as did a ''Cold Case'' episode that used the music of Bruce Springsteen, but the final numbers for both shows were delayed because of the football game's overrun. ABC's ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' (10.27 million), ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' (17.45 million), ''Desperate Housewives'' (23.67 million) and a ''Grey's Anatomy'' clip show (16.41 million) averaged out to squeak by CBS in total viewers, and win more convincingly in the 18-to-49 demographic. The first new ''Housewives'' in more than a month -- in which Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) kissed the husband (Doug Savant) of Lynette (Felicity Huffman), inspiring a jealousy plot -- delivered its lowest ratings for an original episode of the season, despite dominating the 9 p.m. hour.

The uproar began on Monday when Mr. Rather, speaking on MSNBC by telephone, said CBS had erred in handling the evening news broadcast by ''dumbing it down, tarting it up'' and emphasizing celebrities over war coverage in ''hopes of attracting a younger audience,'' The Associated Press reported. Although he referred to Ms. Couric as a ''nice person,'' he said ''the mistake was to try to bring the 'Today' show ethos to the 'Evening News.'

Besides Mr. Clapton's fee for a 60- to 70-minute show, the agreement calls for a $1 million donation to ''a charity of Mr. Clapton's choice to be paid the night of the show.''

Last season's plots included a middle-class, Islamic sleeper-cell family in Southern California, nuclear footballs, deadly rocket attacks, strained Sino-American relations and a shaky American president.

3520,2006/01/22,Trying to Swim With the Record Label Sharks,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/arts/22sisario.html,"When ''Love Monkey,'' which made its debut on CBS on Tuesday, was first pitched to the network, it was based on the novel by Kyle Smith about the romantic indecisiveness of a young newspaperman in New York. The network's verdict: right premise, wrong profession. So the show's creator, Michael Rauch, recalling his time haunting rock clubs with a music-industry friend, retooled the series as the story of a record label scout named Tom (played by Tom Cavanagh), with sharp ears but a clueless heart. Mr. Rauch pumped his friend for industry details and turned to insiders like Tamra Davis, who directed the pilot and is married to Mike D of the Beastie Boys. But how accurately does the show capture A&R representatives, whom Hits, a trade magazine, not so affectionately refers to as weasels? Ben Sisario examined the pilot. THE TALENT -- Several episodes follow Tom's pursuit of a young singer-songwriter named Wayne, played by a real 17-year-old singer-songwriter named Teddy Geiger, who was a runner-up on VH1's ''In Search of the Partridge Family.'' He also has a debut album due in March from Sony, which just happens to be one of the studios behind the show. VERDICT -- Mixed. That kind of corporate cross-promotion is the name of the game these days, but on the show Wayne is presented as a discovery from left field. THE BOSS -- In a pivotal scene, Tom delivers an impassioned boardroom speech, saying ''money shouldn't be our goal'' and ridiculing Hanson as a ''flavor of the minute.'' His boss, Phil (Eric Bogosian), who discovered that band, promptly fires Tom. VERDICT -- Unlikely. An ambitious company man like Tom would know his boss's trophy case inside-out. THE SCAM -- Tom decides to start a label and competes with his former employer, Goliath Records, for Wayne. Tipped about when Goliath's limousine is supposed to arrive, Tom gets to Wayne's hotel a few minutes early in a cab and spirits him away on a rock tour of Manhattan. VERDICT -- Rings true. A&R reps do whatever they must to sign the talent they want. THE SACRIFICE -- In open competition with Goliath, Tom goes to a showcase and splutters to Wayne's parents, ''I will eat, breathe and sleep Wayne because Wayne is everything I have.'' But later, in a reflective mood, he tells them they would be better off with Goliath. VERDICT -- No way. While walking-through-fire promises are classic A&R cant, no professional would quit so easily. THE TOUCHSTONE -- Tom is a connoisseur who misses no opportunity to show off. His love for Bob Dylan is a recurring theme: he gives ''The Essential Bob Dylan'' as a baby-shower gift, and a love interest impresses Tom by giving him the same album. VERDICT -- Probably not. Maybe he'd give Mr. Dylan's Dadaist novel ''Tarantula,'' but a greatest-hits collection is a tad hoi polloi for such a professional snob. THE NEW JOB -- At the end of the pilot, Tom is doubly surprised when an old colleague signs Wayne to his indie label and then offers Tom a prime position. In short order, Tom has lost a job, struck out as a mercenary and landed a new gig. VERDICT -- Entirely plausible. It's a rapidly revolving door at record labels, particularly for A&R scouts. Billboard used to have a weekly column for the changes: Executive Turntable."

Instead, the contestants for the august title and its $30,000 scholarship overwhelmingly favored majors oriented toward the hazily defined concept of communication, including speech communications and entertainment communications and just plain communications. Miss Georgia, moreover, has a degree in consumer journalism; Miss Florida majored in ''exercise and sports sciences.''

Until accepted standards of obscenity are relaxed or Mr. Mamet becomes more adept at censoring himself, these teachings must remain lost to history.

Most of what Mr. Bush said was the CliffsNotes version of the State of the Union speech for local television markets.

In ''Jesse James,'' the straightforward, slightly static ''American Experience'' documentary that has its premiere tonight on public television, he is described as a slight, boyish fellow (about 5 feet 6 inches tall, 120 pounds). The point that Mark Zwonitzer, the documentary's writer, director and producer, really wants to make is that James was no romantic rebel and hardly a Wild West Robin Hood, as some have contended. He thought of himself as a Southern hero. Actually, he was a ruthless, amoral killer. But he felt he had an excuse."

Isn't that often the case? What's interesting about the current favorite is that it comes with a period picture attached, the George Clooney film ''Good Night, and Good Luck.'' The soundtrack is the latest effort from Dianne Reeves, a singer who has been unbeatable in recent awards seasons. ''Good Night, and Good Luck,'' about Edward R. Murrow's broadcast battle with Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, takes place almost entirely at CBS television headquarters in 1953 and 1954. The powerful but mellow alto of Ms. Reeves wafts through the film, as ubiquitous and atmospheric as the smoke from Murrow's cigarettes. Ms. Reeves appears on-screen as a CBS contract singer; in the spirit of cinéma vérité, she and her band recorded much of the soundtrack in character, while cameras rolled. The result, oddly enough, is the leanest, most instantly gratifying album of her career."

But as almost anyone watching America's two leading political families knew, underneath the tranquil image was a drama of ambition, rivalry, love and alliance that could shape the 2008 presidential election. The scene, a riveting tableau in the six-hour celebration of Mrs. King's life and the political power of black America, offered complex layers of interconnecting relationships: father and son, husband and wife, president and former president, adversary turned ally and first lady turned senator turned probable presidential candidate."

Finally, the Grammys have realized they are not like the Academy Awards. What matters most is not the celebrities, or even who gets the awards, but the music. Major awards went to U2 in the rock categories and for song and album of the year; Kanye West, who won the best rap album for the second year in a row; John Legend in R&B and as best new artist."

Grammy voters, for the first time, honored a contestant on the Fox television smash ''American Idol,'' granting that populist phenomenon a measure of acceptance from the musical establishment. Kelly Clarkson, the winner on the show's first season, won best pop vocal album for her second album, ''Breakaway'' (RCA), and best female pop vocal performance -- beating Ms. Carey -- for the hit single ''Since U Been Gone.''"

Then INXS simply chose the closest sound-alike to Michael Hutchence, its original lead singer, who killed himself in 1997. The winner, J. D. Fortune, formerly an Elvis impersonator, went on to make an album with INXS: ''Switch'' (Epic). It sounds like the hitmaking INXS of the 1980's, mixing three-chord rock and guitar funk, and it rode the television publicity into the Top 10 last year. Now Mr. Fortune is touring with INXS, which performed Monday night at Avery Fisher Hall. The opening act was the band led by the runner-up, Marty Casey and the Lovehammers."

(Right, one of the defendants, Thomas Nataas, with his lawyer, Per Sjong Larsen.) Five are charged with planning or taking part in the armed robbery and the sixth is accused of handling stolen goods. The paintings have not been recovered, but the police say that they believe they are in Norway. The trial, before three judges but no jury, is expected to take as long as six weeks. If convicted, the defendants face maximum prison terms of 17 years. Terje Nyboe, a prosecutor, said that if they are found guilty he would urge a reduced sentence if any offered information about the location of the paintings. Mme. President Meets Her Match The NBC ''Late Night'' host, Conan O'Brien, met with President Tarja Halonen of Finland yesterday at the presidential palace in Helsinki (left), The Associated Press reported. Last year, Mr. O'Brien, who resembles the fair-skinned, red-haired Ms. Halonen, 62, endorsed her bid for a second six-year term because they look alike, and used mock advertising to back her and attack her opponents. She won by a narrow margin. Mr. O'Brien's show, with Finnish subtitles, is also seen in Finland, on Subtv, a cable and digital channel, three days after its broadcast in the United States. Actor's Death an Accident Coroners have ruled the sudden death of the actor Chris Penn last month an accident, Reuters reported. The coroner's office in Los Angeles said that the death of Mr. Penn, left, the younger brother of the actor Sean Penn, was caused primarily by ''nonspecific cardiomyopathy'' or an enlarged heart, with the ''effects of multiple medication intake.'' The medications were not specified. Mr. Penn, who weighed more than 300 pounds, was found dead at his home in Santa Monica. An autopsy ruled out murder or suicide. Domingo Bows Out Plácido Domingo, below, has withdrawn from an appearance in Robert Wilson's production of Wagner's ''Walküre'' in Paris in April, The Associated Press reported.

A forthcoming graphic novel from Frank Miller, the Batman writer whose credits include the graphic novels ''The Dark Knight Returns'' and the ''Sin City'' series, pits the caped crusader against Al Qaeda operatives who attack Gotham City, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Miller, who is 120 pages through the 200-page novel -- called ''Holy Terror, Batman!'' -- said it was an unabashed ''piece of propaganda'' and he left no doubt about the outcome. Such works have an honorable tradition, he said, noting: ''Superman punched out Hitler. So did Captain America. That's one of the things they're here for. These are our folk heroes. It just seems silly to chase around the Riddler when you've got Al Qaeda out there.'' Hulk Finds a New Force He used to be the Incredible Hulk.

Sworn in at a ceremony on Monday, Mr. Ferrigno, a bodybuilder before he became a television star, said: ''My father was a police officer with the New York Police Department. I've always had a high respect for officers.'' He will serve at least 20 hours a month. Vatican Museums at 500 Five hundred years ago yesterday, the Vatican Museums were born when Pope Julius II had a Roman-era statue, excavated near the Colosseum, moved into a palace courtyard. Nowadays, the museums attract four million visitors a year to the Sistine Chapel, the Raphael Rooms, the Borgia Apartments and other elements of the complex. In observance of the anniversary, Reuters reported, the Vatican announced that from now to December the museums will conduct seminars, hold conferences, unveil refurbished wings and restorations, the most important being a recently discovered Roman cemetery. Found just inside the Vatican's northern walls during excavations for an underground garage, the tombs were declared by Francesco Buranelli, director of the museums, to be ''a necropolis with no equal in Rome.'' He said the site, dating from the first to third century A.D., includes about 30 mausoleums and 60 individuals tombs in mostly ''excellent'' condition. Books Into Films A novel set in today's Tel Aviv and a nonfiction work about an Iraqi informant have been acquired by Random House Films and Focus Features as the first two projects for their recently announced filmmaking partnership.

It tells of an Arab surgeon living in Tel Aviv who learns a shattering secret about his wife after a suicide bombing. It is to be published in May. The nonfiction work, ''Curveball,'' is being written by Bob Drogin. Derived from his front page article in The Los Angeles Times, it tells of a man who gave deceptive information that was used by the United States government to justify the war in Iraq."

When you get beyond this consensus -- the cultural chasm consensus -- and ask what to do about the problem, there is less agreement. After all, chasms are hard to bridge. Fortunately, this chasm's size is being exaggerated. The Muslim uproar over those Danish cartoons isn't as alien to American culture as we like to think.

Both are huge, largely untapped markets for news and entertainment media companies. And media executives have made a lot of dreamy statements about both of these markets and funneled a lot of effort into them. Yet neither has yet translated into a significant new businesses for established companies, which are feverishly seeking ways to grow in a world of technological and competitive obstacles. While China's media moment seems eternally right around the corner, mobile may be approaching its own at last -- it may just take a lot longer and be less earth-shaking than the recent hoopla may suggest. Last week, there were announcements of three ventures by media companies looking to insinuate themselves into the hip pockets of teenagers and their elders. All three are part of a deluge of wireless moves and offer glimpses at new ways of both distributing existing products and using big-media power to start new businesses."

I hope you understand the statement this will make . . . when we put this book on the list and force everyone to talk about it.'' The book Smiley was selling is called ''The Covenant With Black America'' (Third World Press), and it is indeed on this week's list -- it enters the paperback nonfiction rankings at No. 6. The book, which Smiley edited, is a data-packed manifesto about racial inequality in America circa 2006, with chapters on topics like health care and the justice system. ''The Covenant With Black America'' didn't make this list without some hard, and canny, work on Smiley's part -- he sold the book during a barnstorming 10-city tour, on which he was sometimes accompanied by the Princeton professor Cornel West, and he hopes African-American churches will push the book to their congregations, a strategy that worked for Rick Warren, the author of ''The Purpose-Driven Life.'' Smiley and West recently made a somewhat surreal appearance on Fox News's ''Hannity & Colmes.'' Alan Colmes warned early on that Sean Hannity was going to blow his lid. (''He's going to yell and scream about Harry Belafonte,'' Colmes said.) West called Hannity ''brother Sean,'' but that didn't mellow things out. ''The reason why black people do not support conservatives like you, my dear brother,'' West said, ''is because your argument's not convincing when it comes to focusing on working and poor people.''"

3307,2006/04/16,TBR: Inside the List,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/books/review/16tbr.html,"THIS WEEK IN GOD: Not unpredictably, Dan Brown's ''Da Vinci Code,'' newly out in paperback, kicks sand in the face of every pop novel out there -- it moves directly to No. 1 on the paperback fiction list. (This ranking combines sales of the book in three new editions: mass market, trade and illustrated. The scratch 'n' sniff version can't be far behind.) To date, these editions haven't dented sales of the hardcover version of ''The Da Vinci Code'' -- it appears at No. 2 on the hardcover list. The Brown juggernaut continues to spin off companion books: the two most recent, published the same day as the paperback, are ''Fodor's Guide to 'The Da Vinci Code' '' and ''The 'Da Vinci Code' Travel Journal.'' Another new book catching a ride on ''Da Vinci Code'' mania is Michael Baigent's ''Jesus Papers'' (HarperSanFrancisco), which lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 5. Baigent, you'll recall, is suing Brown in a British court; he claims that Brown, in ''The Da Vinci Code,'' stole the ''architecture'' of his own book, ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'' (1982), written with Richard Leigh. In ''The Jesus Papers,'' Baigent suggests, among other things, that Jesus' crucifixion was faked. This is faith-based literature -- that is, you'll have to take Baigent's word for his claims. Much of his case is based on papers that he says he's scrutinized but that no one else will probably ever see. Critics haven't been kind to ''The Jesus Papers.'' On a recent epidisode of ''Dateline NBC,'' the scholar and writer Elaine Pagels said of Baigent's book, ''It's imaginative, to say the least.'' Another historian, Craig Evans, added, ''It's voodoo scholarship.''"

Mr. Harris has some experience overcoming exposure. When he was a formless 16-year-old he landed a starring role in the ABC drama ''Doogie Howser, M.D.''; when the hit show ended, four years later, he was a lanky teen star with conflicted notions about having his adolescence recorded on film. ''When you age in front of the camera, you can't help but be hyper-conscious about what people think of your big Adam's apple, acne, big ears,'' he said. ''When you become an adult, you have to figure out how to conquer that. So my body issues I had growing up feeling gawky and awkward were really put to the test.''"

So busy, it seems, that he will not finish his next book on schedule, his publisher said in London yesterday. ''At one point we were hoping for it around October or November, but now it's looking like 2007,'' Larry Finlay, the managing director for a division of the Random House Group, told Reuters. Through a spokeswoman for Doubleday, his American publisher, Mr. Brown said: ''My books are time consuming to research and complicated to construct. I am taking the time necessary to ensure that this new book is every bit as entertaining as 'The Da Vinci Code.' '' Mr. Brown, whose British publisher of ''The Da Vinci Code'' was cleared of plagiarism charges two weeks ago, won another legal victory this week when a federal appeals court ruled that the novel, first published in 2003, did not infringe on the copyright of another book, Lewis Perdue's ''Daughter of God,'' from 2000, The Associated Press reported.

Executives at CBS and XM Satellite Radio have said that they were in talks to replace Mr. Roth -- one of several stand-ins for Howard Stern after he moved to satellite radio last December -- with Opie and Anthony, the raunchy talk team once popular on terrestrial radio that has been on XM for 18 months. Mr. Roth, the former lead singer of Van Halen, has been struggling with poor ratings in his three and a half months on the job, and said on the air yesterday that he had first heard he was canceled ''in the car on the way to work today.''

Mr. Abrams, who has been a producer for the hit television shows ''Alias'' and ''Lost,'' will also be among the film's producers and writers. The ''Star Trek'' film franchise has grossed more than $1 billion, according to Variety, though the most recent installment in 2002, ''Star Trek: Nemesis,'' fared poorly at the box office, and the most recent television version, ''Star Trek: Enterprise,'' was canceled last year after receiving low ratings.

But the American Embassy in London said the actor, Lewis Alsamari, below, who is in Paul Greengrass's film ''United 93'' -- a drama about the hijacked flight that crashed outside Shanksville, Pa. -- had not given sufficient notice about his trip. Mr. Alsamari, 30, who has lived in Britain since 1995, said he thought he had been denied a visa because he served in the Iraqi army in the early 90's. An embassy spokeswoman said that Mr. Alsamari had been granted visas in the past and that the embassy would try to process his application quickly to allow him to travel to New York.

Her books regularly hit No. 1 on best-seller lists there, and in 2000 she was named ''Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters.'' She does pretty decently over here, too, of course -- she has sold more than 80 million books in the United States alone. Clark's new novel, ''Two Little Girls in Blue'' (Simon & Schuster), is her 33rd book and 25th suspense novel, and it debuts on the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 1. ''In my novels,'' Clark has said, ''I set out to scare people.'' But she has built her fan base by not scaring anyone too much, and by avoiding sex scenes, graphic violence and profanity. ''Readers identify with my characters,'' she said in an interview posted on her publisher's Web site. ''I write about people going about their daily lives, not looking for trouble, who are suddenly plunged into menacing situations.'' Many of Clark's readers also respond to her personal story. She was born in the Bronx, and her family struggled after her father died when she was 11. She worked at secretarial jobs and spent a year in the late 1940's as a stewardess before turning to writing. ''Where Are the Children?'' (1975) was her first suspense novel and her first huge success -- it's now in its 75th paperback edition. Clark still does plenty of publicity work for her novels, and she's good at it. She stumbled a bit on a recent appearance on CBS's ''Early Show,'' however. Hannah Storm -- who said she has read ''like 25'' of Clark's novels -- welcomed her, only to hear Clark say, ''Well, good morning, Barbara.''"

3257,2006/04/30,TBR: Inside the List,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/books/review/30tbr.html,"THE GHOST LIFE: On the CBS daytime soap ''As the World Turns,'' which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, the characters rarely lack eye-opening events to gossip about. As the Knight Ridder reporter Glenn Garvin wrote recently, the show has seen it all: ''Baby swaps. Returns from the dead. . . . Adultery in treehouses. Dwarf gun-runners swallowed by crocodiles.'' The soap's heyday may be long past, and it's been a couple of years since Eminem messed around with the show's title in a track called ''As the World Turns.'' But there's a new hubbub on the show these days: someone's written a novel spilling the characters' small-town secrets. And, no surprise, that novel has actually been published as a tie-in to the show -- it's called ''Oakdale Confidential'' (Pocket Books), from a writer known only as Anonymous, and it moves to an impressive No. 3 on the hardcover fiction list this week. On the book's jacket, the publisher makes a point of noting that ''the author wishes to remain anonymous.'' To judge from an exasperated blog the ghost writer is maintaining, however, he or she doesn't sound all that pleased to be kept in the wings. ''I knew what I was getting into . . . but a nameless, faceless writer needs some forum in which to blow off the steam of keeping their identity a secret,'' Anonymous writes. ''It's doubtful I'll ever get the chance to jump up and down yelling, 'Me, me, me, it was me, send the kudos this way!' ''"

Did Michael Jordan push off Bryon Russell during his famous N.B.A. title-winning shot over the Jazz? Did Don Denkinger really miss the call during the 1985 World Series that badly?

Wade, the United States Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. By the 1980 national election the Moral Majority, founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, helped defeat 12 incumbent senators. “Whoever speaks up most gets to shape the culture,” Ron Luce, the evangelical activist, said more recently to a crowd of thousands in San Francisco at this year’s BattleCry rally, above, whose mission is to train young Christians to “battle” secular “virtue terrorists.” In this special, the final installment in a three-part series about religious fervor, Christiane Amanpour looks at the ways evangelicals influence American politics, and speaks with Mr. Falwell in what was to be his last interview, just one week before his death in May, about his battle against abortion and his thoughts on the 2008 presidential campaign."

That's the way life is. 21 years ago, as I was just a twinkle in my mom's eye, the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was released into some test markets, with many skeptical retailers. Now I can see just how much sweat is pouring off of Shaq's forehead when I'm shooting free throws on my Playstation 3. He mentions an account of a girl who talks to her dad for 15 minutes on her cell phone and how college students used to dread talking to their parents, trying to distance themselves as much as possible. Maybe it is just me, but that is a perfect example of a generation gap. But yet he claims that's the problem with college. No gap from the students and their parents. My parents don't try to like the same things I do, just simply want to be informed on what their son or daughter is up to. I didn't realize it was a problem to keep in touch with my parents, especially now in a world were I can be reached on my own cell phone, not something my parents had in college, by letter or even better by e-mail.

He feels that his nostalgic vision has been replaced by a hyper-organized, capitalist, and infantilizing system where only ""organization"" drones thrive. In fact, college has not really changed since the sixties, even less so than when he went to school, and it really is not as bad as he suggests. I know only one of my contemporaries who is dissatisfied with college, and that is because his school is 85% male. Overwhelmingly, my generation is having a great time at college, experiencing independence, responsibility, social awareness, and activism like never before in our lives.
