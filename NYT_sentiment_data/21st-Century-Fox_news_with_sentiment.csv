43,73,73,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/23/arts/23arts.html,"Arts, Briefly","The Many Faces of Shakespeare: Is This One Really His? Is a death mask found in a ragpicker's shop in 1842 that of William Shakespeare? This coming Saturday's issue of the British weekly New Scientist says the mask, left, bearing the date 1616 and the high forehead, prominent nose and beard associated with Shakespeare, could be, Agence France-Presse reported. At the behest of Prof. Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel, a scholar of English literature at the University of Mainz in Germany, specialists at the German Federal Bureau of Investigation compared two portraits widely believed to be of Shakespeare with a bust in the Garrick Club in London and concluded that all the faces belonged to the same person. Then engineers at Konica Minolta Europe scanned the bust and the death mask with lasers to construct three-dimensional computer models. ''Superimposing the models revealed perfect matches between the forehead, eyes and nose,'' New Scientist reports. But the lips on the death mask, owned by the city of Darmstadt, Germany, were thinner than those on the bust. The professor said the lips would have shrunk because of loss of blood pressure after death. New Scientist says British experts remain unconvinced, and art historians suspect that the Garrick Club bust was made more than 140 years after Shakespeare died in 1616. News Corp. Creates New TV Network News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, right, yesterday announced plans to begin My Network TV, stepping into a void created when CBS and Warner Brothers Entertainment formed the youth-oriented network CW last month out of the most popular programs on the struggling UPN and WB. The new mini-network will supply prime-time material for 10 local stations left without programming when UPN said it would close, The Associated Press reported. The heart of the new lineup will be ''Desire'' and ''Secrets,'' two six-day-a-week serials with 13-week story lines, like the successful telenovelas on Spanish-language networks like Univision. My Network, led by Roger Ailes, who built Fox News into the leading all-news cable channel, will begin operations on Sept. 5 in major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. A First Musical The Atlantic Theater Company will present the first musical in its history this spring when it opens the final production of its 20th-anniversary season, the world premiere of ''Spring Awakening.'' With music by Duncan Sheik, below, book and lyrics by Steven Sater and direction by Michael Mayer (''Thoroughly Modern Millie''), the show is based on the controversial Frank Wedekind drama ''The Awakening of Spring.'' Written in 1891 and dealing with the onset of puberty in children, the play was not produced until 1906 and was banned in Britain until 1963. With a cast of 14 and choreography by Bill T. Jones, ''Spring Awakening,'' which follows a dozen young people through their sexual awakening, is to begin previews on May 18, open officially on June 15 and run through July 9. Enter the New From 17 countries, 25 features and 5 shorts will receive premieres when the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Media Department of the Museum of Modern Art present the 35th annual New Directors/New Films festival from March 22 to April 2. In addition to the screenings, to be held at the Walter Reade Theater in Lincoln Center and at the Roy and Niuta Titus Theater at the museum, the festival will include a roundtable discussion among the directors on March 26 and a retrospective of documentaries introduced at the festival in the last 20 years. Ireland Honors Friel In ceremonies yesterday in Dublin, Brian Friel, the author of plays including ''Philadelphia, Here I Come!'' and ''Dancing at Lughnasa,'' was awarded the Irish government's highest honor in the arts, becoming one of the five elder statesman of Aosdana, the state-financed artists' academy, when President Mary McAleese placed a ceremonial gold Celtic band around his neck. Mr. Friel, whose ''Faith Healer'' begins previews in April on Broadway, was first elected to Aosdana, the affiliation of creative artists, in 1982. This year, the organization elected 12 new members, bringing its number to 220 and including its first architect, Shelley McNamara, and first musician, Donal Lunny. 'Lost' and Found Seen briefly on the ABC hit series ''Lost,'' a surreal comic novel by an Irish author who died 40 years ago has been rescued from obscurity, Reuters reported. The novel, ''The Third Policeman,'' was written by Flann O'Brien (1911-66), who was influenced by James Joyce, and fans of ''Lost'' are apparently scouring it for clues to the mysterious island where passengers from a downed airliner are marooned. Craig Wright, a supervising producer and scriptwriter for ''Lost,'' said the book, seen on an episode first broadcast in the United States in October, was chosen ''very specifically for a reason.'' Within two days of the broadcast, 10,000 copies were sold. ''It's been amazing,'' said Chad Post, associate director of the Center for Book Culture at Illinois State University in Normal, publisher of O'Brien's books in the United States. ''In three weeks, we sold 15,000 copies, the same number as we'd sold in the last six years.'' Even in Britain, where the episode has yet to be broadcast, requests for the books are being received by HarperCollins, the British publisher. It describes the novel as ''a thriller, an hilarious comic satire about an archetypal village police force, a surrealistic vision of eternity, the story of a tender, brief, unrequited love affair between a man and his bicycle and a chilling fable of unending guilt.'' Footnotes Cherry Jones, who won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Sister Aloysius, will recreate the role for the first six months of a 24-city national tour of John Patrick Shanley's Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, ''Doubt.'' The play, directed by Doug Hughes, who staged the production still running at the Walter Kerr Theater, takes to the road in September. Sting and Trudie Styler, his wife, will portray the composer Robert Schumann and his wife, Clara Wieck, in a one-night-only performance of John Caird's ''Twin Spirits'' on March 27 at the New Victory Theater.

More specifically, they're talking about Revlon, the subject of a 1985 ruling that helped define a corporate board's duties when a company is up for sale.

We're now into week No. 3 of the business world's favorite new soap opera, ''Mr. Murdoch Lusts After Dow Jones.'' And what a strange week it's been. You'd think that when someone offers $60 a share for a stock that has been stuck in the $30s, as the News Corporation's chairman, Rupert Murdoch, did, the controlling shareholders would, at the very least, want to really grapple with it. But in this case, the controlling shareholders are the three dozen or so adult members of the Bancroft family -- and grappling with things related to Dow Jones has never been their style. Nor is it the sort of thing that their supposed advisers, the trustees at the small Boston law firm of Hemenway & Barnes, tend to encourage. Indeed, family members who dare raise legitimate questions about the asset that forms the bulk of their wealth tend to be ostracized by their elders, and cut out of the loop by the trustees.",2007-05-19 01:00:00,-0.1027,0.8511,0.835,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

To be honest, I think their opinions speak more to their own political leanings than anything that transpires onscreen. Why should we assume, for instance, that a large corporation in the year 2154 is American and not a multinational corporation owned, say, by an Australian who happens to have a lot of American employees? Something like News Corp., which owns Fox, which paid for this very blockbuster? (And, yes, Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the News Corporation, is a naturalized American, but the point stands.)",2009-12-22 01:00:00,0.0,0.8355,0.8355,"      Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

The broadcaster, British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, sought to distance itself from Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation conglomerate and, invoking the standard held by British regulators currently weighing the channel's broadcast future, insisted that it was itself a ''fit and proper'' company to hold a broadcasting license. Last year News Corporation abandoned a $12 billion bid to assume full control of BSkyB when its British newspaper subsidiary, News International, a separate company, became mired in the phone hacking scandal that continues to spread through Mr. Murdoch's empire, while also enmeshing some of Britain's top politicians and law-enforcement officials.",2012-05-03 01:00:00,0.0,-0.296,-0.296,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \
