The loss was $106.8 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with net income of $1.25 billion, or $1.29, a year earlier, the company said. The Philadelphia-based company offered to buy New York-based AT&T's cable unit, the nation's largest, for stock and assumed debt now valued at $51.2 billion. AT&T rejected the bid in July. Comcast's operating cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, rose 17 percent to $705.8 million from $605.7 million. The company was expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call, to report $680.4 million in cash flow.",2001-11-01 01:00:00,-0.3182,-0.1779,-0.5766,"       Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

So when a stumbling AT&T announced plans last year to spin off its cable properties, Brian Roberts, Comcast's president, saw a chance to get even and big at the same time.

So word of financial problems last year at Excite@Home, my Internet service provider, worried me. If it died, would I still have my connection? Would I keep my e-mail address? Then, at a New Jersey diner, I overheard some people from Comcast, the cable company through which I had Excite@Home service, discussing the problem. When I asked, they reassured me there would be no interruption in service, come what may.

''These kinds of problems are very typical when you're launching something new,'' said Dave Watson, executive vice president of Comcast Cable, which is based in Philadelphia. Mr. Watson said the most seriously affected customers -- numbering fewer than 100 -- lost service for several days. The New York Times, Jan. 4, 2002 ''That's funny, because I know about 10.''

Since Dec. 27, I have had either intermittent or no service from Comcast. I've sent six e-mails to various customer support addresses and the only response I've gotten is that they are not going to answer because of the high volume of e-mail. They refer to a phone number that I have tried three or four times and gave up after 15 or 20 minutes of holding. Perhaps the most frustrating issue is that I cannot contact a live person to tell my problems to. I can't wait to get the month's bill; then they will listen when I refuse to pay for the lack of service.

The companies said that the official waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act for government questions about the proposed merger had lapsed, meaning that the legislation can no longer be used by the Justice Department to stop the deal. Last December, AT&T agreed to sell its cable television business, the nation's largest, to Comcast for about $47 billion in stock. The deal, now worth about $28 billion, remains on track to be completed during the fourth quarter of this year, although several regulatory hurdles remain. The companies said they would continue to cooperate with the Justice Department on antitrust issues. Shares in both companies rose yesterday.

The cuts, which were first announced to workers Tuesday in a memo, will mostly affect executive and management positions. The jobs of 675 employees will end once the deal closes. The remaining 1,025 workers will be laid off during the postmerger transition period. AT&T Broadband, which has about 40,000 employees nationwide, said the cuts were a result of redundancies. Comcast has about 38,000 employees, with 20,000 in the cable unit. The new AT&T Comcast, based in Philadelphia, would be the largest cable TV provider in the nation, with 22 million subscribers.

58,159,159,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/10/technology/how-it-works-video-on-demand-is-ready-but-the-market-is-not.html,"Video on Demand Is Ready, but the Market Is Not","FOR years, video on demand has been a couch potato's dream. By pushing a few buttons on the remote control, a viewer would be able to order a movie and then sit back and watch as it unfolded immediately on the screen, pausing, rewinding or fast-forwarding at will. Movie-watching would be on the schedule set by the viewer, not the broadcaster or cable company. No need even to get up from the couch to insert a tape or DVD. That has been the promise, and the technology to provide video on demand to television sets is well established. But the service is still very much in its infancy, and economic factors are largely to blame. Viewers need better programming -- like recent popular movies -- before they will flock to video on demand. Studios need better security against video piracy before supplying their most popular movies, but quality encryption is costly and raises the price of the electronic components and set-top boxes that viewers need. And cable companies need more viewers to offset the expense of improving the technology for encryption, compression and set-top boxes. ''I've seen various business models for V.O.D. and the numbers just don't add up, so no one is doing it in a large-scale way,'' said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps/Media Technology Strategies, a New York consulting company. There are currently four million cable customers who use video on demand, and another three million are expected to sign up by the end of the year, said Joe Boyle, vice president for corporate communications of InDemand, a company that distributes content to cable operators. But there are about 70 million households with cable television in the United States, and analysts estimate that widespread adoption of video on demand by cable companies will take anywhere from 3 to 10 years. If companies can make it work, the projected market for first-run movies alone is about $640 million by 2006, according to Jupiter Research. So cable companies like AT&T Broadband, Comcast, Charter Communications, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications and Cablevision Systems are slowly testing or deploying video on demand as part of their digital cable services in some parts of the country. Video on demand makes use of a server computer that contains video files and software to let more than one viewer have access to the video at a time. One model, the n4x made by nCube, a major provider of video-on-demand services, allows up to 53,000 viewers simultaneous access to the same movie or other video content. The video is sent by cable or fiber optic connection from the servers to a set-top box connected to the home television. Video files are compressed to take up less space and transfer faster. Currently, video is compressed according to MPEG-2 standards, although efforts are being made to advance to the MPEG-4 standard, which can be more than 10 times as efficient. The Internet is another conduit for video on demand, streaming delivery of television shows, music videos and other programming to home computers. (On-demand delivery to hand-held devices, as well as via satellite or airwaves, is in the more distant future.) There are a number of relatively new video-on-demand sites like Intertainer, CinemaNow and the forthcoming Movielink, an Internet video-on-demand venture from five major movie studios. But analysts say most viewers are unlikely to want to watch full-length movies on their computers or hand-helds. ''Consumers are more likely to watch short-form content,'' said Lydia Loizides, a Jupiter Research senior analyst. Instead of streaming, a cheaper and faster option is downloading video files to users' hard drives. But downloading also increases the potential that the file will be copied -- a frightening prospect for movie studios. Video files can be encrypted, but encryption schemes can be overcome. ''There is no such thing as hackproof encryption technology,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said. ''The question is which type causes the least amount of damage once it is hacked.'' Whether it is delivered to a television set, a computer or a palmtop, video on demand will depend on the quality of the content -- beyond first-run movies -- to be successful. The way that content is marketed will be important, too. ''Current fare is what drives traffic, so the question then becomes how to refresh old shows and movies,'' said T. S. Kelly, an analyst with Nielsen/NetRatings. ''You need a middle ground between cable's airing movies in an exclusive window and the Internet's making information available anytime. There has to be significant marketing and promotion to make all this old programming an event. Otherwise it becomes just a dusty old library.''",2002-10-10 01:00:00,0.128,0.9217,0.9814,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

''We believe the inquiry is unwarranted and we will comply as appropriate,'' said a spokesman for Cablevision, the No. 2 cable provider in the state, with 1 million customers. YankeeNets owns YES, which broadcasts Yankee baseball games and other sports programming. The channel is available on most cable systems in the area as basic programming. Cablevision sought to include the channel in its premium service and charge customers $2 per month. Comcast, the state's largest cable provider, does broadcast YES.

Bresnan, a closely held company, will acquire 317,000 subscribers in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, the companies said. The cable operations belonged to AT&T Broadband before Comcast acquired the company for $59 billion in November. AT&T Broadband agreed to sell the systems to Bresnan in April for $735 million in cash. The companies changed the terms as pressure on the cable industry for borrowing billions and for questionable accounting made raising money through stock and bond offerings difficult.

97,289,289,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/20/business/can-cable-fast-forward-past-tivo.html,Can Cable Fast-Forward Past TiVo?,"TiVo, the best-known maker of digital video recorders, may need to worry about people like Peter S. Palermo. But Mr. Palermo may also represent just what the cable television industry has been looking for. A few weeks before the P.G.A. Championship golf tournament in Rochester in August, Mr. Palermo, a real estate broker, was trying to figure out how he would record the broadcast. Mr. Palermo thought about buying a TiVo, the digital video recorder, or DVR. Using a computer hard drive and advanced software, a DVR lets the user pause, rewind and fast-forward even with live television programs. It also provides a much easier way to automatically record programs than is possible with videocassette recorders. In the end, Mr. Palermo was turned off from TiVo by the prospect of having to connect all kinds of wires and adding a new box to his home entertainment system. So, instead, he ordered a relatively new product that his cable company, Time Warner Cable, a unit of Time Warner, has been pitching: a set-top box made by Scientific-Atlanta with a DVR already built in. ''The fact that we could do this without the difficulty and complexity of a stand-alone thing made this a perfect fit,'' Mr. Palermo said in a telephone interview on Friday. Mr. Palermo is not alone, and Wall Street and the television industry are taking note. TiVo pioneered the DVR and the TiVo brand -- like Frisbee, Kleenex and Xerox -- has become synonymous with an entire product category. Nonetheless, TiVo's original business of selling stand-alone DVR boxes, along with a monthly support service, appears in danger of being eclipsed by products that are much less expensive for consumers and are integrated with devices that many consumers are already comfortable with, like television set-top boxes. The new DVR-ready set-top boxes offered by cable companies generally cost consumers nothing upfront and add about $10 to a monthly cable bill. That compares with having to pay at least $200 upfront to buy a stand-alone TiVo recorder and, in most cases, taking on a $12.95 monthly subscription. And stand-alone digital recorders -- not only from TiVo but also from smaller companies like ReplayTV, which is owned by Digital Networks North America. -- often require cumbersome connections to existing set-top boxes and televisions. ''This really is the last stand for the stand-alone boxes; this is a dying product,'' Aditya Kishore, an analyst for the Yankee Group, a technology consulting research firm in Boston, said in a telephone interview. ''This is the last Christmas for the stand-alone TiVo box, or any stand-alone DVR box. By next year, the DVR functionality will be widely available in a wide range of other devices, including the set-top boxes.'' It is an issue with enormous implications for advertisers, broadcasters, cable-television carriers and satellite-television providers. The Yankee Group estimates that, so far, 2.5 million to 2.8 million of the nation's roughly 110 million homes have digital video recorders. But DVR's inspire fierce loyalty from those who have them, terrify advertisers (because they can be used to skip commercials) and are seen by many media experts as the future of television. The Yankee Group estimates that in four years, almost 25 million homes will have digital video recorders and that about two-thirds of those will be DVR's that have been integrated into satellite or cable set-top decoders. Even now, while TiVo is the best-known DVR brand, only about 17 percent of the nation's DVR's are stand-alone TiVo-brand units, according to Yankee Group estimates. By far, the leading DVR provider is the EchoStar Communications Corporation, the No.2 satellite-television provider after DirecTV. EchoStar does business as the Dish Network and has developed a digital recording system, which it combines with a satellite television receiver. Last month, EchoStar announced that it had sold its one-millionth DVR unit. ''We believe that over time, DVR technology is going to be the standard,'' said Mark W. Jackson, an EchoStar senior vice president. ''Everyone is going to have it. It's just a question of when -- and who they get it from, of course.'' Time Warner Cable, the No.2 cable-television provider behind the Comcast Corporation, now offers set-top boxes with built-in digital recording in 28 of its 31 local markets. The company expects to soon announce that it had around 250,000 DVR subscribers at the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, Comcast has been concentrating mostly on video-on-demand, which allows customers to view programs stored on a centralized server operated by the cable company. Still, Comcast is also offering the Scientific-Atlanta digital recorder in a few markets and hopes to widely roll out and market a new DVR-enabled set-top box from Motorola early next year. Those threats are a big reason why TiVo's shares have lost 40 percent of their value in recent months, closing down 31 cents, or 3.5 percent, at $8.67 on the Nasdaq on Friday. That is off their 52-week high from July of $14.51. That same danger is also why TiVo, which is based in Alviso, Calif., is scrambling to remake its business model. While sales are expected to be robust this holiday shopping season, the long-term viability of stand-alone DVR's appears dubious. In response, the company is reinventing itself as a supplier of software to other companies that want to make their own DVR's. ''People traditionally might think of us as a company that builds a box and has a service with that box,'' Michael Ramsay, TiVo's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview last week. ''We have transitioned from that model much more to a pure software and services model for our company. We will spend less and less time on the hardware side of what we're doing, so that people who build the DVR hardware become our customers, not our competitors.'' Consumer electronics manufacturers including the Pioneer Corporation and the Toshiba Corporation are already marketing new sorts of combination products that include digital recorders with TiVo software. But Tivo's goal of becoming a pure software vendor also carries risks of its own, namely: Why should a company that has DVR technology of its own pay TiVo instead? According to senior cable-television executives, TiVo is trying to persuade them to use TiVo software in ''premium'' versions of their DVR products. Those executives say TiVo's pitch is that while Motorola's or Scientific-Atlanta's recording systems might be fine for the low-price end of the market, TiVo's more-advanced software appeals to consumer with more money to spend. Mr. Ramsay of TiVo would not discuss specifics of his negotiations with cable companies, but, for now, executives at the biggest cable companies appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach to TiVo's overtures. In that vein, perhaps the biggest uncertainties facing TiVo are the plans of Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation has agreed to acquire control of DirecTV, a unit of the Hughes Corporation. The News Corporation already controls a company called NDS, which is developing its own DVR technology. The DirecTV acquisition is expected to be completed by early next year, and the NDS relationship raises at least the threat that DirecTV, until now TiVo's most important customer, could spurn TiVo for another partner. A News Corporation spokesman declined to comment. Back in Rochester, meanwhile, Mr. Palermo is focused on the World Series. A former minor league player in the Baltimore Orioles's organization, he said he liked to use his DVR to pause, rewind and analyze the motions of hitters and pitchers. He has repeatedly reviewed the home run by Aaron Boone early last Friday morning that propelled the New York Yankees into the series with the Florida Marlins. ''Let me put it this way,'' Mr. Palermo said of his DVR, ''I got to enjoy that home run a whole lot more than anyone else watching.''",2003-10-20 01:00:00,0.0,0.9851,0.9855,"             Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Comcast said that it expected cash flow, or operating income before depreciation and amortization, from its cable operations to rise 15 percent to 17 percent in 2004. The company has forecast profit on that basis of $6.3 billion to $6.4 billion in 2003. The buyback plan comes as Comcast has upgraded cable systems to offer more services and has reversed customer losses at the former AT&T unit. Comcast, which is based in Philadelphia, has cut debt about $7 billion since the November 2002 acquisition.",2003-12-19 01:00:00,0.4019,0.4215,0.6705,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

But it's not too early for federal regulators to stop distracting themselves with small-change debates over the sanctity of the Super Bowl halftime show and focus on remaking the nation's policy on media companies for the 21st century. Comcast should have to work harder to woo federal regulators on this $54.1 billion deal than to persuade Disney shareholders to permit the takeover. It is too soon to offer a final judgment on the merger, but it raises serious concerns about the excessive concentration of media content and distribution channels in one corporation. Comcast will have difficulty countering legitimate fears that marrying the nation's largest cable system with the ABC broadcasting network, with cable networks like ESPN and with movie studios could undermine the competitive marketplace of ideas so crucial to democracy.",2004-02-12 02:00:00,0.0,-0.3716,-0.3716,"           Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Eisner, the company's embattled chief executive, to allow him to retain a salary of $1 million even though he has resigned as chairman, according to two people close to the negotiations. What the haggling this week over Mr. Eisner's contract reflects, analysts said, is that Disney's board was forced to act sooner than expected in separating the chairman and chief executive jobs in the face of overwhelming shareholder dissent in recent days. The board has expressed confidence in Mr. Eisner, worried that if he left now, the company would be vulnerable to a hostile takeover attempt, like the recent $54 billion offer from the Comcast Corporation, or would falter on its planned turnaround.",2004-03-10 02:00:00,0.0,-0.4588,-0.4588,"             Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The possibility of such a bid, which would probably require raising some $18 billion or more, is a surprising twist in a closely watched auction of cable assets that serve 5.4 million subscribers nationwide. A consortium of private equity firms would create a rival to the two giants in cable, Time Warner and Comcast, which have indicated that they plan a joint bid for Adelphia.",2004-11-12 01:00:00,0.0,0.7769,0.7769,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

168,488,488,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/arts/television/28hale.html,Total Television,"CBS won the official ratings race during the first full week of the November sweeps, averaging 15 million viewers per prime-time hour, followed by NBC (11.3), ABC (10.4), Fox (7.3), WB (3.8) and UPN (3.7). But what about the 45 million or so other people, on average, who were watching television? Here's another way of looking at the ratings for that week: instead of ranking the broadcast networks, we've ranked the media conglomerates that own them -- and nearly every other outlet on your TiVo grid. The easy winner, predictably, was Viacom, owner of CBS and UPN as well as the MTV cable networks. But other high finishers, like Time Warner and Liberty Media, may be names that television viewers don't normally think of while cruising channels. (For each company, we added up the average viewers for all of the networks and cable channels in which it has a controlling interest; joint ventures were divided evenly among the owners. Only networks whose numbers are made public by Nielsen Media Research, and which met the company's minimum reporting standards, were included.)

174,509,509,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/01/business/media/01disney.html,"Disney Posts Higher Profits, Lifted by Hits On Television","The Walt Disney Company announced better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Monday, buoyed by turnarounds in its television and theme park businesses that helped to offset a decline in its movie division. Disney's chief financial officer, Thomas O. Staggs, predicted double-digit earnings growth for the next year. Mr. Staggs spoke from a ballroom at the Walt Disney Resort, where analysts and investors were gathered for their yearly conference. Net income for the first quarter of 2005 was up 5 percent, to $723 million, from $688 million in the period a year earlier. Diluted per-share earnings were 35 cents, higher than analysts' expectations. Thomson First Call had predicted a consensus of 29 cents a share. Revenue was relatively flat, increasing 1 percent, to $8.66 billion. The results were welcome for Disney and its investors. The company has shown signs of a rebound after years of foundering. The ABC network has had solid hits in ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Lost,'' visitors are starting to return to theme parks, and ESPN, one of Disney's most valuable properties, continues to report higher affiliate revenues. The results are also expected to reflect positively on the president of Disney, Robert A. Iger, who hopes to succeed the chief executive, Michael D. Eisner. Mr. Eisner said last year that he would not seek to renew his contract after September 2006. In contrast to most of the company's earnings presentations, at this one, Mr. Eisner and Mr. Iger were absent, attending meetings with directors and senior executives, and did not address the analysts. Many questions about Disney's businesses were left unanswered as Mr. Staggs told the crowd it would learn more at division presentations on Tuesday. This year's analyst conference was subdued, in contrast to last year's meeting, when the Comcast Corporation, the largest cable operator in the United States, made an unsolicited $54.1 billion takeover offer for Disney. At last year's meeting, Disney's strong earnings were overshadowed by questions about its future and what role Mr. Eisner would play in it. In the most recent quarter, ended Dec. 31, operating income in the media networks division, which comprises properties like ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel, was up 36 percent over the period a year earlier, to $467 million. The cable networks soared 67 percent. ''You all have seen what hits do for a network and how the margins can swing dramatically,'' Mr. Staggs said, referring to the ABC network. Parks and resorts, for their part, were up 11 percent in operating income to $258 million, from $232 million a year earlier. Results for studio entertainment were damped compared with the quarter last year, when blockbusters like ''Finding Nemo,'' ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' and the platinum release of the Disney classic ''The Lion King'' buoyed the division to operating income of $458 million. On Monday, Disney announced operating income of $333 million for the same time period, largely because of lower DVD sales. Disney has yet to announce its separation from Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the co-founders of Miramax Films, who are expected to leave Disney and begin their own filmmaking venture. People involved in those talks say an announcement could be made in the next two weeks. Mr. Staggs said Disney was going to expand into video games, investing less than $50 million as it explores the business.",2005-02-01 01:00:00,0.4404,0.9876,0.9893,"            Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

ROBERTS stood out on his very first day at Comcast, and not just because he was 12 years old. His father, Ralph J. Roberts, who founded the company, took him along to a meeting nearly four decades ago, when Comcast was planning to go public. Around midnight, executives produced a new draft of the offering document and pored over it for accuracy. It was the boy, however, who noticed that one of the charts read backward, and excitedly told his father. ''That's a good point. Let's change it,'' Brian Roberts recalled his father saying.",2005-04-24 01:00:00,0.0,0.7351,0.7351,"       Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

No Muti, No Tour The resignation this month of Riccardo Muti as music director of La Scala opera house in Milan has led to cancellation of a three-concert tour in Britain next month by the La Scala Philharmonic Orchestra, the Royal Festival Hall in London announced yesterday. A statement said that ''it has not been possible to find an appropriate replacement conductor at such short notice.'' The orchestra was to play in Glasgow and Birmingham as well as London. Goethe Prize for Amos Oz The Israeli writer Amos Oz has been named the winner of the 50,000 euro ($65,000) Goethe Prize, one of Germany's top cultural honors, Agence France-Presse reported. The accolade honors Mr. Oz, below, a peace advocate whose works have been translated into some 30 languages, for his literary output and impressive moral responsibility, said Petra Roth, mayor of Frankfurt and president of the prize jury. Mr. Oz, whose most recent book is the memoir ''A Tale of Love and Darkness'' (Harcourt), told public television in Israel, ''I didn't even know I was a candidate.'' The prize is awarded every two or three years by the city of Frankfurt. Mr. Oz is to receive his prize on Aug. 28, Goethe's birthday. Holbrook's Return Hal Holbrook plans a reprise of his Tony Award-winning role as Mark Twain in ''Mark Twain Tonight!'' for 18 performances at the Brooks Atkinson Theater from June 6 through 26. ... Warren Leight, winner of the 1999 Tony Award for best play for ''Side Man,'' will bring a new play to Off Broadway when the Ma-Yi Theater Company presents his ''No Foreigners Beyond This Point'' at the Culture Project beginning on Sept. 17. Like ''Side Man,'' ''No Foreigners'' was inspired by the playwright's experiences as an English teacher in Guangdong, China, in 1980. ... It's not all right to let cellphones make noise in theaters, but it will be perfectly all right to bang a two-foot-tall drum at Dodger Stages Stage 2 beginning on May 12. That's when ''Drumstruck,'' created by Warren Lieberman and directed by David Warren and billed as the world's first interactive drum-theater experience, arrives by way of Johannesburg and Sydney, Australia. Ticket holders will find a drum on every seat; the show's 11 South and West African percussionists will lead the audience in African drumming. Under the Rainbow The blue and white gingham dress worn by Judy Garland, then 17, when she played Dorothy in the 1939 film ''The Wizard of Oz'' has been sold for $252,000 at auction in London, The Associated Press reported. Representatives said the auctioneers, Bonhams, expected the costume to bring $63,000. Although six dresses were used during filming, they said that only two, including the one sold on Wednesday, had secret pockets. By request, the buyer was not identified. Altered Plans Because the pianist André Watts, below, has suffered what were described as small cuts to two fingers, he has postponed a lecture and performance scheduled for 8 p.m. tomorrow at the Metropolitan Museum. The appearance has been rescheduled for May 15. Tickets for tomorrow will be honored then. Information: (212)570-3949. ... This weekend's Coachella festival in Indio, Calif., has had another A-list cancellation: the British band the Doves. Its bassist and singer, Jimi Goodwin, has strained vocal cords, a representative of the band's label, Capitol, said. Last month the Cocteau Twins canceled their reunion concert at the festival. Actress on the Hot Seat The fan bulletin board on a Web site dedicated to the actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, star of ''The Great New Wonderful,'' a new film about the aftermath of 9/11, has been shut down after it was overwhelmed with criticism of her comment last week that the United States was ''responsible in some way'' for the attacks, Reuters reported. In a statement issued afterward, she said that Sept. 11 was ''an occasion to be brave enough to ask some serious questions about America's role in the world'' and added, ''Because it is always useful as individuals or nations to ask how we may have knowingly or unknowingly contributed to this conflict.'' Footnotes For the first time since being dropped by EMI in 1996, the Philadelphia Orchestra has a recording contract, The Associated Press reported, citing an article in The Philadelphia Inquirer. The orchestra has signed with the Finnish label Ondine for three CD's a year. ...

It seems like the program was a smashing success: G.M. sales surged 42 percent in the first 15 days of July from a year earlier, and Ford and DaimlerChrysler, which joined the price-cutting fray, also enjoyed big rebounds. Look for record or near-record figures when vehicle sales are announced this week. (Tomorrow.) OPEN WALLETS -- The big question is how wide consumers are opening them in places like Wal-Mart and Macy's. Everything else seems to be up these days -- car sales, stocks (the Nasdaq hit a four-year high last Thursday), real estate (aside from ever-surging prices, sales of existing homes hit a record annual rate in June), industrial output, business spending -- so why not store sales? Come on, shoppers, do your duty. (Thursday). BACK TO THE 4'S? -- Well, not everything's going up. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5 percent from its post-9/11 peak of 6.3 percent, and this week we'll find out whether the happy trend continued in June. Was Friday's announcement that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.4 percent in the second quarter a good omen? It was a shade below economists' expectations of 3.5 percent growth, but it might be enough to do the trick and certainly will do nothing to throw Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan off course of continuing to raise interest rates. (Friday) TOP SECRET -- This week, the World Trade Organization is scheduled to produce a ruling -- planned to be a confidential one -- on the European Union's restrictions on genetically modified crops. European environmentalists and much of the European public support the bans, but industry says it violates fair-trade rules. It is just one of several trade disputes between the United States and Europe, including American protests over government subsidies to Airbus. (Friday) MEDIA SHOW -- A big earnings week lies ahead for communications companies. Comcast, the nation's biggest cable provider, and Qwest Communications International, the smallest of the Bell companies, report results tomorrow, followed by Time Warner on Wednesday and Viacom, whose cable networks include MTV and Nickelodeon, on Thursday. ECONOMIC INDICATORS -- Construction spending for June (today); June's factory orders and personal income (tomorrow); weekly jobless claims (Thursday); consumer borrowing in June (Friday).

Patrick Gottsch, the founder and president of RFD, which primarily chronicles life in rural America, said that he had signed an affiliation agreement with Comcast. With the agreement RFD-TV is authorized to begin negotiations with individual Comcast cable systems. Comcast is available in more than 24 million households. While RFD-TV is available in 30 million homes, many are in towns and small cities outside the Northeast; the exception are those that receive the channel via satellite. Jenni Moyer, a Comcast spokeswoman, confirmed the deal. In signing Mr. Imus last year after his firing by CBS Radio and MSNBC over a racial remark, Mr. Gottsch was hoping that Mr. Imus would become a lure for big-city cable operators. RFD is seeking a similar agreement with Time Warner Cable, which has systems in New York City and Los Angeles.",2008-01-31 01:00:00,0.0,0.875,0.875,"     Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

The cable guys were outraged because the Big Ten wanted a dollar per subscriber per month -- nearly triple the price commanded by, say, CNN or the USA Network -- and was further demanding a primo spot on extended basic, which is where everybody who starts a network wants to be. For their part, the cable companies wanted to relegate the Big Ten Network to a sports tier, where the fans who watched the games would also be the ones who pay for them. For the record, while I do not believe in a la carte cable pricing, I do think that sports should be treated as an exception: sports channels are so expensive -- ESPN alone is some $3 a month a subscriber -- that it is the single biggest reason your cable bill is so high. Putting sports channels on a sports tier makes sense, it seems to me.",2008-08-27 01:00:00,0.0,-0.6908,-0.6908,"      Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

Michael J. Kelly, who had been the chief executive since 2009, will become a special adviser to the company and an adviser to Bain Capital, the private equity firm that co-owns the company with the Blackstone Group and Comcast's NBCUniversal.The surprise change signaled a desire on the part of the co-owners to expand the Weather Channel's digital and mobile businesses more quickly. Through mobile apps and Web sites like Weather.com, the company sees an opportunity to have a much bigger international footprint.""Six and a half billion people need information about weather,"" Mr. Kenny said in an interview Tuesday after addressing the company's staff in Atlanta.Mr. Kenny also said that the company would make more investments in long-form programming - part of a gradual move away from live weather news and toward taped weather-related reality shows.""Now that people can get the information they need for their forecast off the Web, and certainly on their mobile phone, that gives us more license to do more long-form on the cable channel,"" he said. The channel remained committed to live news during severe weather, he added.Mr. Kenny, a member of the board of directors of Yahoo, was the president of Akamai until he stepped down last October. He was previously the co-founder of VivaKi, a digital agency that is part of the Publicis Groupe.In a statement, the three co-owners of the Weather Channel said that Mr. Kenny's experience ""gives him a deep understanding of the TV and digital business, and he has the leadership experience and vision to drive global initiatives across all platforms.""Mr. Kelly, similarly, had a digital media background when he was hired two and a half years ago.Mr. Kenny said he was initially recruited to join the board of the company, and was later asked by the board to consider the chief executive position.""What I've long stood for is convergence,"" he said. ""I think you'll see us find better ways to run the Weather Channel as one company, really organized around our hundreds of millions of users.""NBCUniversal and the private equity firms have owned the Weather Channel since 2008.",2012-01-24 01:00:00,0.0,0.9643,0.9643,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \
