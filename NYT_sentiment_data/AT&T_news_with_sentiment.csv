Brett Bartkewicz paced a 21-hit attack with five singles and Jason Loscalzo had four hits including a home run as St. John's beat George Mason, 16-9, yesterday in a loser-out game of the National Collegiate Athletic Association West Regional in Tempe, Ariz. St. John's (26-19), which also got three doubles and a single from Anthony D'Esposito, made five errors in the first two innings and fell behind by 3-0 before staying alive in the double-elimination regional, getting five unearned runs against George Mason (33-15) in the fifth. Redmen starter C. J. Nitkowski (6-3) struck out 10 and allowed two earned runs over seven and two-thirds innings. (AP) Fordham Loses in Midwest: Top-seeded North Carolina State took advantage of Fordham's porous defense in the first three innings and went on to a 12-4 victory in the first round of the Midwest Regional in Stillwater, Okla. The Wolfpack (48-15) scored five unearned runs in the first inning after Fordham starter Ramon Hernandez was within one pitch of getting out of the inning. Four more unearned runs in the third put the game out of reach. Fordham (31-26) next plays the loser of last night's game between Oklahoma State and Connecticut. (AP) Rutgers Loses One: In Knoxville, Tenn., Clemson won, 7-3, to hand Rutgers its first loss in the Mideast Regional. Rutgers (37-16), the Atlantic 10 Conference champion, will play the loser of the game between N.C.-Charlotte and Tennessee. (AP) Yale Is Out: In College Station, Tex., North Carolina eliminated Yale, 11-6, in the Central I Regional. Yale, winner of the Ivy League, ends the season at 33-11. (AP) GOLF Clearwater Shoots a 61, and He's in Third Fulton Allem weathered a record-setting performance by Keith Clearwater and established a one-stroke lead yesterday in the storm-delayed second round of the Southwestern Bell Colonial in Fort Worth, Tex. Allem birdied the final hole from 25 feet to cap a seven-under 63 and set a tournament record of 11-under-par 129 over the first 36 holes. Clearwater birdied the last seven holes -- averaging more than 20 feet a putt while falling one short of the PGA Tour record -- for a 61 on the 7,010-yard Colonial course. His 61 was a course and tournament record, and a score that has been bettered only 10 times in the history of the American tour, a pair of 59's by Al Geiberger and Chip Beck, and eight scores of 60. With a 132 total, however, Clearwater trailed both Allem and Dick Mast, who shot 66 and was a stroke off the pace on a day the course was robbed of its natural defenses by gentle breezes and greens slowed and softened by a day-long series of showers. In a group at 133, one behind Clearwater, were Tom Watson, Greg Norman, Russ Cochran, Mark Calcavecchia and Jeff Maggert. (AP) Two Eagles for Robbins: Kelly Robbins had two eagles in a four-under-par 68 yesterday to take sole possession of the lead after two rounds of the L.P.G.A. Corning Classic in Corning, N.Y.. Robbins, who started the round in a three-way tie for the lead, has a 36-hole total of 138, one stroke in front of Hiromi Kobayashi of Japan, who also shot a 68. Alison Nicholas had a 71 and was next at 141. Murphy and Turnesa Rally: Going into the back 18 of the 36-hole best-ball Wilson Memorial Cup yesterday at the Scarsdale (N.Y.) Golf Club, Steve Murphy and Jim Turnesa thought their chances of winning the 22d annual tournament for a third time were minimal. The twosome from the Knollwood Country Club in Elmsford finished the first 18 with a two-under-par 70 that put them in seventh place, seven strokes off the leaders, John Baldwin and Peter Van Ingen of the Meadow Brook Country Club on Long Island. But Murphy and Turnesa combined for a 65 on the back to finish with a 135 and earn the victory by a stroke as Baldwin and Van Ingen scored a 73 and fell into a second-place tie at 136. Also in second was Ridgewood team of Paul Antenucci and Tim Shea.",1993-05-29 01:00:00,0.0,0.9313,0.9313,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Charges, and U.S. Keeps Hunting The folks at KPMG Peat Marwick, the nation's fourth-largest accounting firm, got something they understand last week: a number. Dogged like other accountants by uncertain liability for audits of failed savings and loan institutions, the firm settled Federal charges over the crisis for $186.5 million -- a tab of $116,563 for each partner. The payment, mostly covered by insurance, is ""an intelligent business decision,"" said Jon C. Madonna, the firm's chief, and the deal did add up nicely when compared to some other Federal S.& L. settlements by the Big Six. But the Government's figures are pretty nice, too. Federal agencies have collected $2 billion from accountants, lawyers and other professionals from the S.& L. debacle -- half from four big accounting firms. ""And the program is still young,"" a Government spokesman said, with hope. The payments are funneled to institutions made insolvent by the S.& L. crisis. At P.& .G, Profit Follows Flub The lesson may be to stick to soap. Tarnished by a $102 million loss in its third quarter from bad derivatives investments, Procter & Gamble regained some shine last week, announcing net earnings of $406 million in its fourth quarter. At 56 cents a share -- up 12 cents from the comparable quarter last year, excluding adjustments -- the results impressed analysts and spurred P.& G.'s chief, Edwin L. Artzt, to write the tale's epitome. ""This was a good year,"" he said, ""and if not for the derivatives it would have been a great year."" Even more notable: P.& G. achieved its results despite sales not much higher than a year ago. Internet: New Way to Spend! Credit card issuers rejoiced last week when some young, intrepid entrepreneurs successfully conducted the first secure retail transaction on the Internet, the global computer network. ""Secure"" is the key word; without a practical way to keep credit card numbers confidential, businesses will balk at turning the Internet into a major marketplace. Using a scrambling technique known as data encryption, though, tiny Net Market Company of Nashua, N.H., has solved the problem. And what was the pioneering purchase? A compact disk, ""Ten Summoners' Tales,"" by rock musician Sting. Price: $12.48 plus shipping. Disney Turns Interactive Built on imagination, the Disney company had nonetheless envisioned little future for itself on the information superhighway. Until last week, that is, when the company announced a venture with three Baby Bells -- Ameritech, BellSouth and Southwestern Bell -- to offer video services to homes. The venture is still vague, with no word on how ownership or profits will be split, but the Bells' reach to 50 million customers in 19 states makes the deal's potential broad. That is, if Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, has really discarded his well-known disdain for the superhighway and believes, as Tinkerbell would surely hope. Valdez Catch: $287 Million About 10,000 Alaskan fishermen reeled in nearly $287 million in damages from Exxon last week, courtesy of a Federal jury deliberating over the Valdez oil spill of 1989. But the compensatory award was much closer to Exxon's damage estimate of $113 million than to the fishermen's $895 million goal -- and that's how the paid parties saw it. ""It's not what I wanted,"" said the plaintiffs' lead lawyer. But it's not over till it's over, and the jury in Anchorage will next consider whether Exxon should pay punitive damages for the mishap. The plaintiffs are asking for a whopper: $15 billion. INTERNATIONAL Rockwell, Russia in Air Plan Faster and safer are an odd mix in the world of transportation, but that's what Rockwell International and Russia's aviation-research agency expect from their plan to modernize the nation's air-traffic control system. Announced in Moscow last week, the project will eventually trim hours from flights between the United States and the Far East, and enhance safety by enabling planes near or over Russia to rely upon both Russian and American navigational satellites. True, it's yet one more story about the cold war's demise, but there's a kicker. Rockwell is getting $4.7 million in financing -- from the Defense Department. For Kenneth A. Medlin, a Rockwell executive vice president, the deal represents ""defense conversion at its very best."" China Lands a Boeing Deal When Boeing announced it would invest $100 million in a Chinese plant to make the tail sections of its most popular plane -- the 737 -- the reasons were several and self-evident. One, China is a big Boeing fan, with 52 of the nation's 79 plane purchases last year coming from the Seattle manufacturer. Two, China is looming ever larger on Boeing's ledgers, with 14 percent of the company's 1994 deliveries destined for that fast-emerging market. And three, Boeing competitors Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas are also energetically investing in China and chatting up the Chinese. Uncounted was Wichita, Kan., where the 737 tail sections are currently made. But to union complaints that last week's deal hurts American workers, Boeing just pointed to reasons 1, 2 and 3. THE ECONOMY Greenspan's Secret: Stories How do Alan Greenspan and his Federal Reserve colleagues divine where inflation is headed? Complex computer models? Reams of statistics? Forecasting formulas? In part, yes, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week, but there are also . . . stories. The Federal Reserve chairman used a dressed-up phrase, ""detailed readings of firm behavior,"" but he essentially meant stories -- stories from companies, trade groups and others about rising prices. Changes in the American economy and statistics' assumptions about economic relationships makes mere data insufficient for decision making, Mr. Greenspan said. Prices Up, Sales Down, Be Wary Alan Greenspan's reliance on stories (see above) was vindicated last week, when the Government's July figures for producer prices and retail sales were released -- and at once were labeled misleading. Producer or ""finished goods"" prices rose half a percentage point, but the rise came mainly from coffee and gasoline prices, not from the prices that make the inflation-wary Federal Reserve snap to. And while retail sales fell one-tenth of a percentage point in July, the drop did not mean consumers wanted to buy less. It just mirrored auto makers' difficulty in restocking car lots that buyers had picked clean last spring. Fittingly, the deceptive data just ""adds to the ambiguity"" of whether the Fed will raise interest rates, said one economist. Companies Tapped for Wiretaps The electronic frontier needs sheriffs like any other, and the F.B.I. says bills introduced in Congress last week will give it the technological draw on cyberspace bandits. Under the proposals, telephone and cable companies must alter their networks to make wiretapping easier, and they will get $500 million in Federal money to pay for the modifications. Company executives were reluctant to be deputies in the deal, however; one testified that $500 million is ""severely underestimated."" The true costs are ""very, very difficult"" to come by, agreed the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh. But, he warned, ""I certainly know what the cost of not proceeding will be."" Info Highway: No Traffic Jam? It all depends. That's the answer to the commercially pressing question of how many people ride the Internet, the global computer network. Cyberspace demographers often say 20 million to 30 million, but when Network Wizards, of Menlo Park, Calif., counted 3.2 million computers on the Internet in a survey last week, doubts arose. Not over the machines, but over how many people use each of them. About 10 people per machine is a common assumption; it underpins the 20 million to 30 million estimate. But some revisionists now say 3.5 people per machine, and some say 5 to 10. Riding on it all: how many potential buyers pass by the electronic storefronts that businesses are now scrambling to build.",1994-08-14 01:00:00,0.0,0.9843,0.9843,"              Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The merger would likely reduce the number of phone companies that will compete for local phone customers, thus lessening the incentive to offer lower prices or better service. But the two companies might be able to show that the merger will create large savings that can be passed along to customers. The Justice Department and Federal regulators owe consumers a probing investigation before they grant approval. The merged company would be the second-largest telecommunications firm, exceeded only by AT&T, with about $25 billion in revenues, 35 million customers and 130,000 employees spread out over 12 Eastern states. Bell Atlantic and Nynex do not serve the same households, so there will be no immediate effect on competition for the business of local phone customers. The merger might nevertheless help customers if it produces substantial cost savings. New Yorkers can also take heart that Bell Atlantic's well-regarded management will almost certainly improve the erratic customer service now provided by Nynex.",1996-04-23 01:00:00,0.0,0.9699,0.9699,"             Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The caller was his former deputy, Philip J. Quigley, now the chairman of the Pacific Telesis Group. And the message was stunning: Pacific Telesis had just announced that it would sell itself to SBC Communications in the first marriage of two regional Bell telephone companies. Mr. Ginn is understandably sensitive about the $17 billion deal. Some of his telephone industry colleagues believe that Mr. Ginn, who preceded Mr. Quigley as chairman of Pacific Telesis, deprived the company of its future by spinning off its lucrative cellular properties in 1994. Lacking a presence in the fastest-growing part of the business and yoked to the unforgiving California market, Pacific Telesis may have had little choice but to sell out to the more robust SBC.",1996-05-06 01:00:00,0.5719,0.4478,0.6474,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

When they agreed to merge this spring, Bell Atlantic and Nynex pointedly passed up an opportunity to announce the elimination of 3,000 ""overlapped"" jobs. New markets would open for the merged company, they insisted, saving the workers from layoffs. ""We think we will create enough new jobs to redeploy most of those 3,000 people,"" said Ivan G. Seidenberg, Nynex's chairman. The emphasis -- and even the buzzwords -- are shifting. The rhetorical trumpeting of layoffs, as if they were a badge of honor, is disappearing. The negative publicity that descended on AT&T after it announced in January that it would eliminate 40,000 jobs was a turning point. Now, companies are choosing to highlight the potential for new hires down the road. Announcements are increasingly in the style of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, with their focus on growth to save jobs, and only a footnote-like nod of acknowledgment that the 3,000 workers might be laid off if the growth fails to materialize.",1996-06-18 01:00:00,0.7351,0.91,0.9565,"            Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

On Friday, Intel broke the news that it wouldn't rake in quite the fortune it had expected to, and investors, fearing a high-tech judgment day, sent its shares down 15 percent within minutes. And since Intel is the world's largest maker of computer chips and since computers are where it's at these days, the whole market gave a little shudder -- especially the technology-heavy Nasdaq. By day's end, though, investors decided the digital world as we know it was not crashing, and Intel's shares were off just 7 percent, to $151.50. The Dow industrials barely changed, at 7,331, while the Nasdaq lost 2.7 percent. Nike, another company that seemed invincible -- or at least seemed to have endless cash to pay athletes to display its little swoosh -- also took a hit. Its shares fell 13 percent on Thursday after it predicted less-bouncy earnings, but recovered a bit Friday, closing the week at $57.25. REGULATORS A New F.C.C. Ball Game ''I hope we put the ball in the net more times than not,'' Reed E. Hundt said last week -- and no, he wasn't talking about basketball. But forgive him, please, for indulging in that all-too-American habit of lapsing into sports analogies at the drop of a bat. He's had a busy few years as head of the Federal Communications Commission and was announcing his decision to hang up his cleats. Just look what happened while he was on the mound: telephone deregulation, digital TV licenses, a push for cable competition, guiding the wireless revolution. And then, as further proof that his beat is a busy one, there were rumblings last week about a merger between AT&T and SBC Communications, a deal whose size would hit the old record out of the park. HOLLYWOOD The Dinosaurs of Summer Think of the great old movies -- ''Children of Paradise,'' say, or ''Notorious'' or ''Treasure of the Sierra Madre.'' If they had opened a week later, or a week earlier, would it have affected their greatness one iota? Of course not. But just look at summer movie madness now, at all the huffing and puffing about which mega-budget, mega-effects movie will land on a given weekend. Greatness? They don't need no stinkin' greatness -- they need blowout box-office numbers, and they need them now, before the next blockbuster barges in. ''Lost World'' certainly got them last weekend -- a record of more than $90 million. And for the blockbusters-in-waiting, lined up like snorting jumbo jets in the narrow alley out back, the summer suddenly seems a lot more spacious. Why? Because they learned that ''Titanic,'' the blowout of blowouts, with its $200 million price tag, won't be plowing into theaters until December. TELEPHONE ABUSE Just Let It Ring The telephone isn't all bad. None of its virtues come to mind, but there must be some. One big irritant: The oily voice comes on -- you can almost see the slicked-back hair, the loud tie -- promising breathlessly that if you buy a certain stock now, you'll be rich within minutes. Guaranteed. The more you balk, the oilier it gets -- flattery, knowing whispers, dramatic pauses, despairing sighs. (You pathetically timid worm, they seem to say.) Don't think for a moment, though, that these are spur-of-the-moment improvisations. Regulators from 20 states filed a flurry of lawsuits last week in an effort to crack down on penny-stock pestering -- a nuisance that has spread recently, feeding on a greed born of the soaring stock market. And the legal papers included dozens of scripts, laying out the whole oily sequence -- pause, flatter and sigh. TOBACCO WARS Blowing Smoke at Joe Camel R. J. Reynolds says its Joe Camel ads are not aimed at young smokers. But a Federal Trade Commission official called the ad campaign ''one of the most effective in decades,'' and the statistics bear that out: In 1987, when the ads first appeared in the United States, 3 percent of under-age smokers chose Camels; by 1993, it was 13.2 percent. And last week, for the first time, the F.T.C. made its displeasure official, accusing Reynolds of violating Federal laws by promoting lethal and addictive products to those not even old enough to buy them. Did this accusation add spice to the talks aimed at pinning down the tobacco industry's long-term liability? Perhaps. Last week antismoking advocates huddled in Chicago -- though not, presumably, in the proverbial smoke-filled room -- and urged negotiators not to rush into any deal. AUTOS Electric Cars, Humming Most people still think of electric cars as a pipe dream. But the cars are most definitely coming. They don't go far enough, you say? Well, their limited range seems to become less limited by the day. At the Tour de Sol recently -- a rally for such pipe dreams -- a converted Geo Metro went 249 miles without recharging. That's a record for ''production models'' -- which means at least five have been sold. More to the point, the average for production models jumped in a year from 141 miles to 168 -- closing in on the power of a tank of gas. But aren't they too slow? Not exactly. At the rally, one electric car was nabbed by police radar. One thing, though: being so quiet, will they sneak up on us, programmed as we are to listen, not always look, at intersections? Some are equipped with a pedestrian warning signal, but the driver must activate it. CAREER CHANGES Instant Journalist It was one of the more intriguing midcareer corrections, right up there with Sol Wachtler's segue from judge to felon, or Ronald Reagan's leap from Hollywood to the White House. Yes, when Susan Molinari, rising Republican star, turned her back on the political world -- for the moment, at least -- to become a CBS newscaster, some ungenerous souls pointed out that she sorely lacked journalistic credentials. But they were ignoring a central modern truth: a celebrity is a celebrity, period. If Michael Jordan turned up on the happy-talk news with one of those cute weather maps and told us it would snow tomorrow, we'd dig out the boots and shovels in a second. The question is: If snow falls on Republicans, will Ms. Molinari tell it like it is? And speaking of career switches: Jules Feiffer, indelibly linked with The Village Voice, left the paper last week. No, he wasn't downsized, but his paycheck would have been -- from $75,000 a year to zero -- even as the paper kept running his cartoons. BANKING, JUST BANKING Farewell, Cash-Flow Sonata Why would someone play a piano in a bank? It makes no sense, no sense at all. A bank is about money; music is about -- well, it's not about money. Harrumph. An official at Republic National's World Trade Center branch put it succinctly: ''This is a bank. It's not a concert hall.'' Yes, yes, a pianist named Anthony Polistina did delight bank customers there for 20 years, did add a multitude of soothing curves to an increasingly straight-ahead world, but that was clearly an aberration, an oversight. And last week Republic straightened out that oversight, banishing Mr. Polistina and his music to make way for new A.T.M.'s. There were cries of protest, of course, with customers circulating petitions and some even closing their accounts. But they just don't understand progress.",1997-06-01 01:00:00,0.0,0.8958,0.8958,"           Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Lawyers, lawmakers and lobbyists were almost unanimous in predicting that such a deal would never pass regulatory muster. Harold H. Greene, the Federal judge who issued the landmark ruling that broke up AT&T's Bell System in 1984, said in an interview, ''I don't think there is a great deal of competition in either local or long distance, which should be a prerequisite for recombining the Bell System empire.''",1997-06-02 01:00:00,0.0,0.5994,0.5994,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Allen, declared yesterday that such a deal would enhance competition. Mr. Allen declined to confirm reports that his company was negotiating a $50 billion merger with SBC Communications, nor did he mention the company by name. But in a speech to executives in Boston that seemed almost like a wink and a nod, Mr. Allen said that merging long-distance and local phone companies was not ''unthinkable.''",1997-06-11 01:00:00,0.34,0.2975,0.5584,"       Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

160,464,464,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/11/opinion/stirrings-in-the-phone-market.html,Stirrings in the Phone Market,"Two events last week raised hopes that the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which was intended by Congress to bring competition to local telephone markets, was not passed in vain. SBC Communications, the parent of Southwestern Bell and Pacific Bell, proposed to take over Southern New England Telecommunications, the local phone company for Connecticut. Then, AT&T proposed to buy Teleport, a New York company that provides local phone service in more than 60 cities. Yet these are modest moves. So far, the 1996 act has spawned more court suits than competition. The SBC merger merely replaces one phone company with another, providing Connecticut no additional choices. But the merger does hold out the possibility that SBC will use Connecticut as a springboard to enter long-distance and local service for residential customers in the Northeast as a whole, thereby giving Bell Atlantic-Nynex a long-awaited run for its customers.",1998-01-11 01:00:00,0.0,0.6522,0.6522,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

161,465,465,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/11/business/diary-013994.html,DIARY,"WHEELS All Very Swiftian No need to be shipwrecked on an exotic island to have your sense of scale demolished: a modern Gulliver need go no farther than Detroit. At the auto show last week, Volkswagen rolled out its new Beetle, which returns to the Lilliputian end of the United States market after a 21-year absence, while just a few booths away Ford unveiled its Brobdingnagian new F-250, a pickup whose hood ornament is further off the ground than Dr. Ruth Westheimer's chin. Car makers and critics braced for a struggle over the Yahooish way light trucks have of mangling most any car they hit broadside; manufacturers are quietly pushing to have new side-impact standards set no higher than in Europe, where, unlike here, big light trucks are scarce. But the news on the environmental front might please the Houyhnhnms, Swift's race of selfless, sagacious horses: the Big Three and several Japanese companies are talking seriously about making new high-technology, high-mileage cars in the next few model years, and Ford says it will voluntarily upgrade its light trucks to meet the much tougher emissions standards imposed on cars. PRICES Won't Be Undersold Wholesale prices fell two-tenths of a percent in December and 1.2 percent for all of 1997, the Labor Department announced, and the ''core'' rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy numbers, fell for the first time in memory last year. Analysts are calling the inflation outlook the best in a generation, with even the labor markets -- tight, by historical standards -- on good behavior. Among economists, fretting about inflation is beginning to give way to fretting about possible deflation and the economic harm that would come. JOBS Won't Be Idle The latest evidence from the astrophysics lab says the universe will keep expanding forever, a characteristic that the American economy and labor force seem to share these days. An unexpectedly plentiful 370,000 new jobs were created in December, but unemployment actually ticked up slightly because an even greater number of new workers entered the labor force, the Labor Department reported. A record 64.1 percent of American adults are now in the labor force, but it wasn't a salary bidding war that drew them in: Real hourly wages rose just 0.1 percent last month. BUDGETS You Mean There's Extra? President Clinton said he planned to submit a balanced budget to Congress for fiscal 1999, three years ahead of schedule, and predicted a comparatively trivial Federal deficit of about $22 billion for 1998. Wall Street yawned, having long since predicted that the strong economy would erase the deficit, but political leaders dived gleefully into an unaccustomed task: arguing over what to do with spare money. The President is expected to discuss new initiatives on child care and the environment in his State of the Union message later in the month; House Speaker Newt Gingrich is talking about tax cuts. Consumers are way ahead of Washington this time: They unexpectedly reversed a three-year borrowing binge in November, reducing their total indebtedness by $4.2 billion, according to Treasury Department figures released last week. ASIAN TURMOIL, PART I Rescues Needing Rescues It turns out not to be quite as simple as tossing out a multibillion-dollar life preserver and hauling in the rope. Financial rescue plans sponsored by the International Monetary Fund for several Asian countries showed signs of unraveling last week, largely because of the reluctance of the recipients to swim along quietly in the specified direction. Indonesia announced a new budget that blithely ignored the I.M.F.'s fiscal advice, and when the rescuers' displeasure became known, the country's currency and its stock market sank like stones. Dire rumors, panic buying and fears of political instability swept the country. And in Thailand, which was the first Asian domino to fall, I.M.F.-required austerity measures are already pinching too hard for the Prime Minister, who asked for an easing of the terms. ASIAN TURMOIL, PART II Devil in the Details Compared with Southeast Asia, South Korea seems calm. Its streets are quiet, and the stock market has stanched its bleeding. But the particulars of the debt restructuring the country badly needs are proving thorny. After a week of squabbling, creditor banks were near agreement on a plan to give the country a breather of 30 to 90 days on loan payments. Still to be sorted out is what happens next: who will buy a proposed bond issue and what kinds of government guarantees they will get. COMPUTERS New Year, New Prospects January is the time of year Steven Jobs likes to spring surprises: He introduced the Macintosh computer with a stunning ''1984''-themed commercial that ran just once, during that year's Super Bowl; since then new products from Apple Computer have often been announced at the January MacWorld trade show. Mr. Jobs's show stopper this year was his announcement that Apple had managed a small profit in the first quarter of its 1998 fiscal year. The crisis is far from over for the company Mr. Jobs founded -- and is now trying to turn around after a three-year slide in other hands -- but Wall Street was delighted by the progress so far, pushing Apple's stock up 20 percent. TELECOMMUNICATIONS Buying Local Why invent what you can buy instead? SBC Communications, which bought Pacific Telesis in 1996 in the first merger among the Baby Bells, has announced a deal to acquire Connecticut's phone company, Southern New England Telephone, one of the few remaining sizable independents, for $4.4 billion. One lure: S.N.E.T. has regulatory permission to sell long-distance service to its local customers, a privilege so far denied to SBC and its former Bell siblings. And AT&T was attracted by a 26-state local franchise when it agreed last week to buy Teleport Communications for $11.3 billion in stock. The deal would spare AT&T the aggravation and cost of building its own new local service from scratch, and had been expected for months.",1998-01-11 01:00:00,0.0,0.2786,0.2786,"             Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The biggest question: Will the telephone companies or the cable companies win the battle to offer this service? The new consortium, which is scheduled to announce its venture this week, so far includes GTE and U S West Communications, BellSouth, SBC Communications and Ameritech, together with the technology giants Microsoft, Intel and Compaq Computer. The companies hope to develop new modems and software that will be up to 30 times faster than today's telephone modems.",1998-01-25 01:00:00,0.0,0.6249,0.6249,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The Dow Jones industrial average, rising steadily for almost two months, gained 25.41 points, to 8,775.40, its third consecutive record. In a year when few Wall Street analysts expected to Dow to gain double-digits, the blue-chip average is already up 11 percent, one of its best starts this decade. After three spectacular years of share price gains, the market is once again strengthening against a backdrop of solid economic growth, heavy cash flows into mutual funds and speculation that more and more companies will merge, pushing share prices even higher. The brokerage industry -- one of the prime benefactors of this bull market -- has been both a source of tremendous profit growth, driven by an increasingly investment-hungry populace, and heavy speculation about new banking combinations. Yesterday, for instance, talk that the Chase Manhattan Corporation might merge with Merrill Lynch sent Merrill's shares up more than 9 percent, despite denials among industry insiders that a deal was pending. Chase and Merrill declined comment. Shares of Chase also rose a day after the nation's biggest commercial bank said it would cut 4,500 jobs, by laying off 2,250 employees and not replacing the others, in the next 18 months. In the last three years, brokerage stocks, as calculated in the American Stock Exchange's security and broker-dealer index, are up about 500 percent, partly because of new combinations such as Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter and the merger of Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney, which is part of the Travelers Group. Shares of several regional telephone companies also rose yesterday after Edward Whitacre, Jr., the chairman of SBC Communications, said he might be interested in buying another local phone company. It has been that kind of a market. Earnings growth may be eroding, but analysts say investors believe the economy will remain strong, and the eagerness to own stocks is greater than ever. Since the Dow fell 554 points last Oct. 27 to hit 7,161.15 on fears of a deepening economic crisis in Southeast Asia, the average has risen 1,614 points, or 22.5 percent. Even ardent bulls are wondering whether the market has risen too fast. ''The momentum unleashed in the last few weeks means we're going to go to the extreme on the greed side,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards Inc. ''People have lots of money and they don't want to leave a winning game.'' Shares of energy companies gained after oil prices rebounded from a series of declines. Exxon and Chevron were among the leading Dow component stocks. Investors also bought up technology shares despite recent profit warnings. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.98 points to close at a record 1,788.28. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.07 points to close at a record 1,085.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 1.07, to a record 427.18. Richard Eakle, an analyst and president of Eakle Associates in Fair Haven, N.J., said the market has been buoyed by middle-aged investors who see stocks as the fountain of wealth. ''The primary catalyst is the baby- boomer generation liquidity situation,'' he said. ''That generation is going to invest as much as they can.''",1998-03-19 01:00:00,0.0,0.9937,0.9937,"             Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

By linking to consumers through TCI's extensive cable television system, which reaches 10.5 million homes, AT&T could reduce the amount it pays the Bells to begin and end long-distance calls, while building a platform to offer local phone service and high-speed access to the Internet.",1998-06-26 01:00:00,0.4404,0.5859,0.7717,"      Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

At least, that's the way it has seemed since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 kicked off the biggest round of changes in the industry since AT&T was divided into eight pieces in 1984. But AT&T can still throw its weight around, as it did in forging the most important communications deal of 1998 - its agreement to acquire Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable company, for $32 billion. And that was in addition to taking over Teleport Communications Group for $11.3 billion, and putting together a $10 billion joint venture with British Telecommunications. The big local phone companies also continued to consolidate: In May, Ameritech agreed to become part of SBC Communications for $56 billion; in July, Ivan Seidenberg, far left, chief executive of Bell Atlantic, and his counterpart at GTE, Charles R. Lee, announced the planned $52 billion merger of their companies. Worldcom Inc.'s 1997 pact to acquire the MCI Communications went through last year, as well, but only after MCI agreed to sell its Internet business to Cable and Wireless of Britain for $1.75 billion.",1999-01-04 01:00:00,0.0,0.5714,0.5714,"  Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

Burke; Flag Investors Communications Trust,"BRUCE E. BEHRENS assumed command of a sleepy-sounding mutual fund, Flag Investors Telephone Income Trust, at its inception in January 1984. At the time, its shareholders probably had no inkling of the breathtaking voyage ahead. The fund was conceived as a vessel for managing clients' investments in eight companies born with the breakup of AT&T; the original focus was on dividend income. But over the years, Mr. Behrens has branched out into other areas of the fast-growing communications industry, and he has shifted his focus from income to total return.

And in truth, SBC is agreeing to steps as radical as any phone company has ever taken to appease the F.C.C. in return for regulatory approval for a takeover. In addition to the commitment to expand into new markets, including New York, it accepted a long list of highly technical alterations to its network and business structure that seem sure to increase competition within its territory and that will require many dollars and many hours of engineering work to accomplish.",1999-07-01 01:00:00,0.3182,0.9652,0.9705,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

''Contrary to the suggestion of some press accounts, neither we nor the full commission has indicated even tentative approval of the SBC-Ameritech transaction or conditions, Commissioner Gloria Tristani, a Democrat, and Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican, said on Wednesday.

But some of the mergers designed to make local phone service better risk constraining what viewers can see on their cable systems, threatening the diversity of information that is central to democracy. A scorecard was needed to keep track of all the recent maneuvers. Bell Atlantic, the largest local phone company, asked the Federal Communications Commission for permission to enter long-distance service, where it would take on AT&T, MCI Worldcom and Sprint, thereby increasing competition. But then MCI Worldcom and Sprint decided to merge, a move that would lessen competition. Meanwhile, the commission approved the merger of SBC Communications and Ameritech, two large regional Bell companies. It also approved rules that will make it easier for AT&T, a huge cable operator, to take over another cable company, Mediaone, putting about 60 percent of American households within reach of AT&T's cable programs.",1999-10-10 01:00:00,0.0,0.8779,0.8779,"            Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

After all, very few funds explicitly track that venerable benchmark, which on Monday dropped four issues -- Union Carbide, Goodyear, Chevron and Sears, Roebuck -- while adding four standard-bearers of the new economy -- Microsoft, Intel, Home Depot and SBC Communications. But the makeover meant a lot to Richard Moroney, co-manager of the $110 million Strong Dow 30 Value fund. It indexes half of its portfolio to the Dow, then uses various Dow valuation theories to weight the other half, which also holds only Dow stocks.",1999-11-07 01:00:00,0.0,0.8201,0.8201,"      Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

And Now Microsoft,"WHAT a week it was for true believers in technology stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average almost doubled its weighting in technology shares last Monday when it added Microsoft, Intel and SBC Communications to its 30-company list. And on Wednesday, white-hot technology shares propelled the Nasdaq composite above the 3,000 mark for the first time. At Friday's close, the Nasdaq composite was up a blazing 41.48 percent this year. Not surprisingly, investors are flocking to mutual funds that invest in technology stocks. For the week that ended on Nov. 3, almost $700 million went into technology funds, roughly double the amount that migrated there in other recent weeks. According to AMG Data Services, assets in equity and technology mutual funds grew more in that week than they have since the week that ended on Oct. 21, 1998.",1999-11-07 01:00:00,0.0,0.7195,0.7195,"      Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

Notebaert, former chairman of the Ameritech Corporation, has agreed to become chief executive of Tellabs Inc., the medium-sized maker of communications equipment. Mr. Notebaert takes the reins on Sept. 18. Michael J. Birck, one of the company's founders and the current chief executive, will give up that title and become the company's chairman. Previously, Tellabs did not have a chairman, though Mr. Birck filled that role informally. Mr. Notebaert, 53, left Ameritech, one of the Bell local phone giants, when that company was acquired last year by SBC Communications Inc. The move to Tellabs may be fitting because Ameritech was based in Chicago while Tellabs is based in Lisle, Ill., a Chicago suburb. Tellabs has long been more respected for its technology than for its business acumen. The company is best known for its products that connect fiber optic communications rings to one another. From a business standpoint, however, the company's acquisitions generally have not been fantastically successful. Tellabs shares rose $1.0625, to $62.6875, yesterday in Nasdaq trading.

298,863,863,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/12/business/us-may-pressure-landlords-to-allow-digital-competition.html,U.S. May Pressure Landlords to Allow Digital Competition,"The Federal Communications Commission is considering issuing new rules today that would take a step toward forcing commercial landlords to open their buildings to almost any communications carrier that wants access to their tenants, according to people close to the commission. As new forms of digital communication have swept the nation and hundreds of companies have emerged to provide them, landlords of apartment buildings and office towers have had an almost inviolable right to determine which companies may set up shop inside their properties. Now that may begin to change. Government officials and industry executives said commission members and their staffs were still battling over the proposals yesterday afternoon and it was possible the F.C.C. could postpone any action. But whether the issue is addressed today or in the near future, the battle lines have been drawn. Consider 450 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, a building near 44th Street that includes the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell, a law firm, and Cline Davis & Mann, an advertising agency. Hines Interests, the building's manager, holds stakes in Broadband Office and Allied Riser Communications, young companies that wire office buildings and offer advanced communications services. Hines has allowed the two to install equipment at 450 Lexington and has yet to give other carriers the same access. Davis Polk and Cline Davis refused to comment, as did Broadband Office. But communications companies that think they are being shut out, as well as some consumer advocates, have not hesitated to attack a system they say is unfair. ''Given the paucity of local communications competition that has emerged since the telecommunications deregulation act of 1996, it's absolutely critical to use every mechanism possible to jump-start greater consumer access to multiple telecommunications providers,'' Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, said yesterday. ''This would be one step forward for breaking down barriers to local competition.'' Others see the matter differently. ''To us, a building is a community,'' said Steve Peterson, a vice president at Hines, a commercial real estate company based in Houston. ''In Texas alone there are 419 registered CLEC's,'' he added, using industry jargon for competitive local exchange carriers. ''Can we have 419 carriers and their equipment in our building? The answer is no.'' ''We're not trying to exclude anybody,'' he said. ''But we want to make sure that all of the carriers are there for the long haul, and yes, we want to maintain a little bit of control over the process. It's our building, after all.'' The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the commission to foster increased competition in local markets, and the F.C.C. chairman, William E. Kennard, a Democrat, has made that a primary goal. But realizing that any attempt to exert direct jurisdiction over landlords would be fraught with political and perhaps legal difficulties, the commission appeared to be leaning toward trying to deal with the controversy indirectly. Rather than regulate landlords, the F.C.C. was considering issuing rules that would prohibit carriers from agreeing to exclusive real estate deals, according to industry executives and people close to the commission. Under the proposal, the carriers, who almost always are subject to regulatory certification, would not be allowed to sign a contract under which they would be the only company allowed to install a network in an office building. In addition, the commission appeared to be leaning toward requiring communications carriers to share their space within office buildings with competitors. To serve business customers who spend thousands of dollars a month on communications services, some companies prefer to install advanced antennas on roofs. Others like to put some sort of switch or router in the basement. Many want to install wiring throughout the building. The landlords control a company's ability to deploy its system. If this fight sounds familiar, it should. In many ways, the debate is just the latest variation of AT&T's battle to retain control over Internet services delivered over its cable system, or, for that matter, the fight over whether America Online must open its instant messaging system to rivals. With some exceptions, landlords have almost the same power in apartment buildings as in office towers. But the issue has become ripe in the business sector because some carriers prefer to install equipment in the buildings of businesses they serve. Such equipment is generally not required to serve residential consumers. The conflict over access to commercial buildings is bubbling over just now because the real estate industry is more involved than ever in the communications business. Landlords are taking financial stakes in new carriers in exchange for giving those carriers the sometimes exclusive right to install equipment. Phone giants like Verizon Communications and SBC Communications, which already have lines into almost all the roughly 750,000 office buildings across the nation, have not been on the front lines of this debate. Those with complaints are generally smaller, newer companies. ''We're seeing an increasing amount of landlords who are interested in choice only to the extent that they have taken a financial interest in a carrier,'' said David S. Turetsky, a senior vice president at Teligent Inc., a new local communications company, and a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department. ''What they all have in common is that none of those models respects the ultimate choice of the tenant.'' Broadband Office was formed by a consortium of real estate companies, together with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm. Joey D. Mooring, a spokesman for Allied Riser, said his company had granted warrants, a form of equity ownership similar to stock options, to some real estate companies that have opened their buildings, but would not be specific. ''Tenants within the buildings should have the ability to choose who their provider is,'' he said. As a business proposition, lobbyists for the real estate industry tend to agree. But as a matter of regulation, they say the government has no right to tell landlords who can and cannot come in. ''This is something that's driven by the tenant market, and tenant choice is the way for people in the real estate industry to be successful,'' said Roger Platt, spokesman for the Real Access Alliance. This group, formed by many of the nation's biggest real estate companies, has lobbied the F.C.C. to back off. ''Building owners are being portrayed as evil characters out of a Dickens novel,'' he said. ''One of the fundamental aspects of being a manager of property is you have the right to both include certain people and to exclude certain individuals. There are narrow constitutional restrictions on that, but otherwise the Constitution is very clear.'' That argument has found some resonance at the F.C.C. At least one commissioner, Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican, has made it clear from the start that the case for forced access is weak at best, said Helgi Walker, a legal adviser to Mr. Furchtgott-Roth. ''Even if such statutory authority were within the discretion of the commission,'' she said, ''the exercise of that discretionary authority would at least raise questions about the constitutionality of its action.'' Taking a page from AT&T's playbook, the Real Access Alliance has suggested voluntary guidelines for preserving competition. In addition to other rules, the commission may make a point of trying to hold the alliance's members to those commitments. Some communications experts suggested that having taken intermediate efforts would be a necessary building block in any future effort to regulate property owners more directly. In the end, however, the companies that have complained appear more interested in getting fast access to buildings than in helping the F.C.C. expand its jurisdiction. ''The point is really to create a process that shortens something that already works,'' said William J. Rouhana Jr., chairman of Winstar Communications, a new local carrier.

The measures would relax restrictions that have made it impossible for AT&T to expand further in the cable industry. They would save the regional Bell companies billions paid to local carriers that some rivals and groups say would be shifted to Internet users. And they would kill a plan to create hundreds of new low-power FM stations for churches, schools and community groups.",2000-10-24 01:00:00,0.0258,0.8268,0.8313,"           Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local phone companies to enter the long-distance market on a state-by-state basis as they convince the F.C.C. that they have opened their local networks in those states. So far, Verizon Communications Inc. has been allowed to offer long distance in New York and SBC in Texas. SBC is known as an aggressive company, and yesterday's application was an aggressive regulatory move. There is less local phone competition in Kansas and Oklahoma than in either New York or Texas, so the commission's approval could set a new and potentially lower bar for the other Bells to clear.

But in fact, AT&T may be losing something that if not necessarily good, has been a powerful force in its favor for more than 100 years: the fear that its size and power has inspired in competitors. The AT&T-brand companies that remain after the breakup plan is completed by 2002 will be smaller than the AT&T the communications world has known.

It is a sobering piece of research. Mr. Suria began by pointing out that in the past four years, debt at a group of seven high-grade telecommunications companies, including AT&T, Verizon and SBC, exploded from $93 billion, to $210 billion, an annualized rate of almost 23 percent. At lesser-quality telecom and media services companies, like Global Crossing, Nextel Communications and PSI Net, high-yield corporate debt and convertible bond issuance ballooned to $275 billion, a compounded annual rate of 60 percent, in the period.",2000-11-19 01:00:00,0.3612,-0.4404,-0.1027,"     Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

In late 1999, Bell Atlantic, now Verizon Communications Inc., won the right to sell long-distance service in New York. Last year, SBC entered the long-distance market in Texas.

''Make the smart call -- bench Ameritech,'' he says on one of them. ''Staying with Ameritech is just plain dumb,'' he advises on another. And last week, a new series of billboards began appearing in the city, as well as in Detroit and Pittsburgh, recommending: ''Choose Wisely. Because Now You Can.'' The billboards are part of a major advertising campaign by Z-Tel Technologies, a small, publicly traded residential-phone company based in Tampa, Fla., that is struggling to make a name for itself.

The company, which is based in Atlanta, also said it expected earnings per share to increase 7 percent to 9 percent in 2002.

The move is not only beneficial to state consumers; it could be of vital importance to the nation's overall economy. In recent years, healthy competition has revolutionized the market for many telecommunications products, from long distance to cellphone services. Local service, however, remains a near-monopoly, firmly in the hands of the Baby Bells, including Verizon, that were created by the breakup of AT&T in 1984 and control the ''last mile'' of wire into consumers' homes and offices. Nationwide, competitors to the Baby Bells provide local service to less than 10 percent of all phone lines, and only 5 percent of all residential lines.",2002-01-24 01:00:00,0.3182,0.7179,0.8071,"             Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Michael Sabia, above, who took over as BCE's chief executive less than three months ago, said that regaining full ownership of Bell Canada would help BCE ''diminish uncertainty and focus our operations.'' In recent years, the company has diversified into media ownership, e-commerce and other internet services. SBC, which is based in San Antonio, acquired the stake when it bought the Ameritech Corporation.

The five-year agreement gives AOL Time Warner, based in New York, access to a network covering 40 million homes and businesses in the United States, Covad said in a statement. Shares of Covad, which emerged from bankruptcy in December, rose as much as 29 percent, before ending the day at $1.32, up 18 cents, or 15.8 percent. As the number of new consumers using dial-up Internet access slows, AOL Time Warner is trying to add customers through agreements with companies like Verizon Communications and SBC Communications, which have regional high-speed networks. Covad sells high-speed links to the Internet through digital subscriber lines. AOL Time Warner will pay Covad an undisclosed amount a month for each subscriber. A Covad spokeswoman, Martha Sessums, declined to give the amount.

The court, based in Denver, found the phone giant liable for more than $25 million on Tuesday. Charlie Sullivan, who with 10 partners formed Coin Link, an independent pay phone operator that sued Southwestern, said: ''We know that Southwestern Bell was trying to monopolize the market. In reality, they still have such a great percentage.'' In 2000, an Oklahoma jury awarded the plaintiffs $7.4 million in damages. State antitrust law permits the damages to be tripled, bringing the total to more than $22 million, plus lawyers' fees. The award could eventually total $29 million to $30 million, including interest, Robert Edinger, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said. The judges said that Southwestern Bell froze out competition through long-term contracts with the owners of sites for pay phones. The contracts included stiff penalties for early termination. Southwestern also ''employed several other measures to freeze out competition,'' including failing to remove its pay phones when site owners requested removal, the judges wrote.

Last week, Vodafone offered to buy the 85 percent of Cegetel it did not already own for 13.1 billion euros ($12.8 billion). The offer includes the stakes held by the BT Group, SBC Communications and Vivendi. Under the terms of a shareholder agreement, Vivendi has the option of counterbidding and can supersede Vodafone's offer for the BT or SBC stakes. Vodafone has given Vivendi a deadline of Nov. 10 to make a counteroffer. Vivendi's plans to either buy those stakes or try to get Vodafone to offer a higher price suffered a setback this week, when Vivendi received unacceptable offers for its publishing division, which includes Houghton Mifflin. It has now decided to auction Houghton Mifflin at a later date if it does not receive higher bids by tomorrow. Vivendi is arguing that the Nov. 10 deadline violates part of the Cegetel shareholder agreement, which stipulates that any offer for Cegetel must be accompanied by a 30-day grace period for due diligence. Vodafone says that rule does not apply to existing shareholders, who are already familiar with the company.

In contrast to the United States, where AT&T was broken up long ago and curbs placed on the new regional operating companies, regulators in Canada have taken a softer approach, seeking to encourage competition without destabilizing the entrenched incumbents. The hope has been that new entrants would gain market share by building networks of their own, and, with some help from regulators, by gaining access to existing lines at reasonable cost.",2003-04-22 01:00:00,0.0,0.9561,0.9561,"             Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The fine was for selling long-distance calling without permission. Qwest sold long-distance service before regulators cleared it to do so in some of the 14 Western states where it dominates local calling, the F.C.C. said. Qwest agreed to the fine as part of a settlement. The fine exceeds a $6 million penalty the F.C.C. gave to SBC Communications in October for denying competitors access to its phone network, an F.C.C. spokesman, David Fiske, said. Regional phone companies like Qwest must prove that their local phone networks are open to rivals before they can sell long-distance. Qwest has done so in 12 states and awaits a ruling on Minnesota next month. Shares of Qwest fell 32 cents, or 7.2 percent, to $4.11. They have dropped from a high of $66 in March 2000.",2003-05-08 01:00:00,-0.4939,0.5423,0.0772,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

That future may be at hand, only a few years behind schedule, as a result of the telephone industry's declining economic fortunes, increasing competition and recent technological advances. Starting with MCI, which introduced its Neighborhood plan in April 2002, most leading phone companies -- AT&T, BellSouth, Qwest Communications, SBC Communications and Verizon -- have rolled out programs that allow customers in some states to make unlimited local and national calls for one flat monthly price.",2003-05-23 01:00:00,0.0,0.7269,0.7269,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

SBC and BellSouth, both leading providers of local phone service, are seeking to win back business from wireless carriers, including Cingular. SBC and BellSouth lost a combined 497,000 local lines in the first quarter as some customers started using cellphones, exclusively, to save money. The plan, called MinuteShare, is being tested in Texas and will be available later this year, SBC and BellSouth said yesterday. The alliance underlines phone companies' desire to attract customers in a shrinking market by linking products. Wireless companies like Cingular sell calling packages that include 900 minutes for as little as $39.99 a month. Under MinuteShare, a Cingular customer paying a fixed monthly fee for a certain number of minutes could use those minutes to make long-distance calls over the SBC or BellSouth networks, an SBC spokesman, Michael Coe, said. He declined to say how much the new call package would cost. SBC shares rose 35 cents, to $26.53. BellSouth shares fell 14 cents, to $26.89.",2003-06-06 01:00:00,0.0,0.9531,0.9531,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The sale, representing about one-fifth of NextWave's spectrum licenses, is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission and the federal bankruptcy court that is overseeing NextWave's reorganization. Other companies have the right to bid a higher price. NextWave will maintain a presence in 20 of the 34 markets. The licenses would give Cingular, a joint venture of BellSouth and SBC, room to grow in some of the most lucrative urban markets, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington. In addition, the deal will give entry into a handful of other markets, including El Paso, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City. Executives of NextWave, which owns licenses in 95 of the largest markets nationwide, said the money would be used to pay the debt owed the F.C.C. and to help finance future ventures as it tries to emerge from bankruptcy protection.

From January 2000 to May 2002, Cingular did not allow new users a grace period to cancel service without paying contract-termination fees as high as $550, the state agency, the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a decision posted on its Web site yesterday. The company also did not tell users about problems with its wireless network in 2001, the decision said. A spokesman for Cingular, a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth based in Atlanta, did not immediately respond to a call for comment. Earlier yesterday, Cingular and 22 other United States cellular companies adopted voluntary customer rights standards, trying to derail tougher rules proposed by the California commission. The commission also ordered Cingular to reimburse customers who paid the contract-termination fee during the period.",2003-09-10 01:00:00,0.0,-0.7481,-0.7481,"           Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

To reduce the need for trips down the hall to check on climate conditions in the nursery, Philips Electronics has come up with its SBC SC769 Read-and-Rest Easy baby monitor, which has a built-in room thermometer and temperature display. The parental half of the Read-and-Rest Easy monitor system features an L.C.D. screen showing the room temperature as recorded by the baby's unit. With a range of 600 feet, parents can putter about the house with the monitor in tow while still listening in on the child. The parental unit displays the monitor's signal strength, battery-charge status and, by means of lights that work in sync with the speaker, the level of noise in the baby's room -- so that a hungry child can be both heard and seen.",2003-10-16 01:00:00,0.0,0.8968,0.8968,"       Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

But the debate over how government treats the Internet is likely to reach a new level of intensity now that Internet technology is colliding with one of the nation's most lucrative businesses, telephone service. Last week AT&T and Time Warner Cable announced that they intended to make Internet-based phone service available to millions of consumers next year, allowing those consumers to bypass traditional phone companies. Those moves signaled the start of a technological shift that could change one of the biggest and most important industries in the American economy. Central to that shift is whether and how Internet phone service should be regulated, a question that the Federal Communications Commission started to explore in hearings two weeks ago.",2003-12-15 01:00:00,0.3818,0.5563,0.7346,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Beginning in June, SBC evaluated proposals from 20 companies before deciding on Alcatel, a company spokesman, Jason Hillery, said. Alcatel was among the favorites because SBC had already used Alcatel equipment to outfit a San Francisco business and residential complex with what is known as fiber to the premises, or F.T.T.P. SBC, BellSouth and Verizon Communications say F.T.T.P. will counter the growing threat from the nation's top five cable companies, which within the last year began complementing their cable TV and broadband services with local and long-distance dialing over an Internet connection.",2003-12-17 01:00:00,0.0,0.3182,0.3182,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

For me, it began when my family moved into a new apartment this year and Verizon informed us that we would need to wait two weeks for a working phone line. Once that service began, we would have to pay about $50 a month even though we wanted to make only local phone calls on the line.

Under the law, leasing plans are reached by negotiation or arbitration and then must be approved by state regulators, with a possible federal court appeal.

The company also formally announced that it was considering buyout offers. Some critics attribute the company's circumstances to management missteps. Others say, however, that the turbulent dynamics of the telecommunications industry is partly to blame. Over all, AT&T Wireless has posted solid numbers in recent years, doubling its number of subscribers since it went public in 2000 and developing a niche in the profitable corporate market. But it nonetheless has failed to keep pace in an arena where relatively small missteps can give rivals a big advantage.",2004-01-23 01:00:00,0.0,0.046,0.046,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

On Sunday, the San Antonio-based company raised the price of some Web access to $29.95 a month from $26.95, a spokesman, Joe Izbrand, said. The change applies to orders placed online and customers who buy certain other services, like local and long-distance calling. The lower price will still apply when customers buy a range of services that include wireless calling. SBC cut the prices last quarter to extend the company's lead in DSL. The discounts ended to help fulfill a pledge by the chief executive, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., to stem profit-margin declines this year. Shares of SBC rose 96 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $26.46. At the end of last year, SBC had 3.5 million so-called digital subscriber lines, which let customers download information more quickly than dial-up connections. If DSL is the only product purchased besides local calling, the price will be $34.95 a month, Mr. Izbrand said. SBC sells a faster version of DSL for $44.95 a month.",2004-02-03 01:00:00,0.0,0.8316,0.8316,"       Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

Chairman Urges Phone Companies to Settle on Rates,"The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission urged the nation's telephone companies yesterday to sit down for 30 days to settle on the appropriate rates for gaining access to local networks. If they cannot agree, the chairman, Michael K. Powell, said he will propose that the commission adopt interim rules for the use of the networks. The commission issued rules last year that were intended to make local phone markets more competitive and gave a great deal of regulatory authority to the states in setting discounted prices for access to local telephone networks. That rule was struck down last week by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which said that the rule delegated too much authority to the states. The ruling could increase the cost of access for local-phone competitors like AT&T and MCI and, by extension, their customers.",2004-03-11 01:00:00,0.0,0.9311,0.9311,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Verizon said that it would lease its lines in customized three-year deals to competitors. Verizon, which operates in 30 states, said the price would vary by state but would typically range from $20 to $24 per telephone line a month, with the cost rising each subsequent year. The offer from Verizon follows similar proposals by other regional telephone giants, like SBC and BellSouth. Generally, the offers come after a recent appeals court decision that threw out federal rules forcing the dominant local phone companies, like Verizon, to lease their networks to competitors at low rates set by state regulators.

That is the net effect of its refusal to appeal to the Supreme Court a federal court decision striking down rules that gave local phone companies access to the Baby Bells' networks. Even more disturbing, the administration pressured the Federal Communications Commission, ostensibly an independent agency, to abstain from filing its own appeal in defense of its own rules. The core of the 1996 legislation was a requirement that local phone companies -- the regional Baby Bells, like Verizon and SBC, created with the breakup of Ma Bell a decade earlier -- open up their local markets to competition by leasing access to their lines and other equipment before being allowed to offer long-distance service. The Baby Bells have grudgingly complied, and some 20 million households get their local service from competitors.",2004-06-14 01:00:00,0.0,0.204,0.204,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The groups say that an appeals court decision to remove the cap on these access fees, which goes into effect today, will give the Bells a free hand to raise the prices they charge AT&T, MCI and hundreds of other companies trying to get into the local phone market. It will also push many smaller phone companies out of business, they say, and ultimately lead to higher phone rates for consumers.",2004-06-15 01:00:00,0.0,0.4588,0.4588,"      Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

The company said the deployment would be contingent on whether regulatory rules remain intact that would not force SBC -- and other regional Bell operating companies -- to lease their networks to competitors at low rates set by states. The company said that once the regulatory rules were clarified, it would deploy a network designed to deliver high-definition television, high-speed Internet service, and telephone calls delivered via the Internet through technology known as VOIP. SBC said it was already testing various applications of the network, including working with Microsoft to create digital television services.

Cingular would reacquire those licenses in a takeover of AT&T Wireless. In its announcement yesterday, the Justice Department said the new agreement modified the original settlement so that SBC and BellSouth would not be in violation of the accord once they acquire AT&T Wireless. The Justice Department said new competition in the Indiana and California markets had eliminated the antitrust concerns that prompted the 2000 settlement.",2004-08-12 01:00:00,0.0,0.9845,0.9845,"           Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Michael J. De La Cruz, its vice president for sales and marketing, said that bigotry -- the company is owned by Mexican-Americans -- accounted for some of the problem. But the bigger part was that Group O Direct, though it had been around since 1974, did not know how to navigate corporate shoals. Then, in 2001, SBC Communications, seeking more minority vendors, took Group O Direct, in Milan, Ill., under its wing. ''They led us through their procurement process, what certifications we needed, how to write a bid, who to contact, how to set prices,'' Mr. De La Cruz said. SBC then gave Group O Direct a small contract. A few years later, the Microsoft Corporation helped Group O Direct further ''enhance and refine our business processes,'' as Mr. De La Cruz put it, then gave the company a contract, too. One result is that Group O Direct's revenues will probably exceed $50 million this year.",2005-09-20 01:00:00,0.0,-0.0202,-0.0202,"       Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \
