But there's another possible reaction to the Bell Atlantic-T.C.I. behemoth: apprehension. The company that owns video access to the home would also own programs that flow into the home. To some critics, that invites monopolistic price-setting and monopolistic taste-setting.

The merger, he said, would give us ""the flexibility of the automobile."" But the proposed merger is actually less a matter of commuter flexibility than of who owns the roadway, the tollbooths and most of the cars. If the Government allows the merger, it would give a single, massive company the power to decide who can ride on the so-called information superhighway of the future. Consumers should hope that when the Senate antitrust subcommittee begins hearings on the matter on Wednesday, it can be quickly persuaded to squash the merger.",0.0,0.8322,0.8322,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

62,139,139,1993-11-21 01:00:00,The Executive Life; In a Fast Lane On the Data Highway,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/business/the-executive-life-in-a-fast-lane-on-the-data-highway.html,"I'm an entrepreneur, Why do I feel like a gunslinger, Or a buffalo hunter, Or a dinosaur, Here, on what was the unfettered frontier, Of free enterprise? -- ""That Sinking Feeling,"" by Yankee Jones, ""Briefcase Poetry, Volume 2,"" 1981. ""I'M NOT in the cable business,"" insists Glenn R. Jones, chairman and chief executive of Jones Intercable Inc., Jones Spacelink Ltd., Jones International Ltd. and Mind Extension University. ""I'm in the business of extending the human mind."" Certainly, Mr. Jones, 63, is not your everyday cable executive. The owner of 23-year-old Jones Intercable, the country's seventh-largest cable operator, which owns or manages 44 cable systems serving 1.4 million subscribers in California, New York and 18 other states, sees himself as a visionary pioneer on the information highway, an entrepreneur/ risk-taker, a poet of technology. He works from a high-tech headquarters in Denver. And he reads voraciously, cites science fiction easily and writes books and poetry (as Yankee Jones). Like Ted Turner, Mr. Jones is also producing his own programming. In 1989, he founded the Jones Entertainment Group, which produced the current release ""Household Saints."" And like other cable moguls, Mr. Jones has recently seen his wealth ballooning -- Intercable's shares are up nearly 70 percent since May, trading at around $17 last week -- as Wall Street has become bullish on cable's role in the future delivery of home entertainment. Witness Bell Atlantic's deal for Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator, and the battle between Viacom and QVC Network for Paramount Communications. Indeed, Intercable and Spacelink themselves may merge to help attract a partnership deal or capital from Pacific Telesis or Bell Canada. ""The entertainment business,"" Mr. Jones says, ""impacts the human mind, which is the determination point of the electronic highway. The brain is a three-pound electrochemical device that cooks along at about 25 watts, mostly glucose. It's really the world's first computer."" Mr. Jones's mix of management philosophy and technological jargon suggests a cross between Carl Sagan and Ross Perot. To keep up with the latest ideas, Mr. Jones often buys $500 worth of books at a time and stuffs them into three backpacks, keeping one in the office, one on his five-seater jet and one in the trunk of his white Mercedes. At his Frank Lloyd Wright-style home in Denver, he just finished reading a biography of Jefferson and has started one on John Paul Jones. ""Those people,"" he said, ""talked about the idea of individual freedom and the concept of self-government -- a delicate, tenuous experiment still going on because it was based on having an informed electorate, which brings you right into education. Our democracy needs to become more electronic."" The education of America is Mr. Jones's passion. He has lavished some $30 million on his Mind Extension University since he founded it in 1987 to provide college classes -- with credit -- by cable. This type of education, he said, would not have worked before the advent of the VCR, with its taping capabilities. Right now, 25.5 million subscribers to basic cable systems that carry the MEU channel can watch classes for free, but those seeking credit must enroll at one of the 26 universities. The schools, which charge MEU students less than the full cost of actually attending class, include the University of California at Berkeley, George Washington University, the University of Maryland and Colorado State. Currently, Mr. Jones said, 36,000 students are enrolled in at least one course. Linda Roberts, special adviser on technology for the United States Education Department, gives Mr. Jones credit for being on the cutting edge of the information highway. ""Mind Extension University is a very important example of how we can use today's technological systems, whether cable or interactive fiber,"" she said. While he is proud of his educational mission, Mr. Jones is a bit defensive about MEU's for-profit status as well as its current lack of profits. ""It is a legitimate purpose of the private sector to focus upon and help resolve the intractable problems of our culture,"" he insisted. He added: ""I'm taking the risks. And it's un-American for me not to make a profit somewhere down the line -- about three years."" Mr. Jones is used to being called crazy -- like a fox. ""We started small when people didn't understand the limited partnership concept"" in acquiring cable systems, he said, ""so we had to form our own securities company. We raised $152,000 with the first limited partnership, then started raising $33 million and $55 million at a clip. It was un-American at the time, but it became mainstream when I raised $200 million. Since 1972, we've raised $1.3 billion in capital. We have 170,000 limited partners."" In many ways, Mr. Jones is already living the future. Of the company's 3,600 employees in the Denver area, 350 work in the suburb of Englewood in a glass office building with a helicopter pad. Fiber-optic and coaxial cables snake under the floors. Mr. Jones's circular office has 16 television sets and a computer that can manipulate several satellite dishes. At the center of the building is an atrium, featuring a big reflecting pool with an island. In a ceremony in the atrium each year, Mr. Jones honors one of his employees for a job well done. The employee receives the award on the island as colleagues watch and bagpipes play. ""There's a lot of poetry in business,"" Mr. Jones said. ""Hard as it is.""",0.0,0.9961,0.9961,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Like most management lessons these days, it comes from Japan. But this is different from all other Japanese management lessons. This one is about how not to do it. That the lesson was painfully learned in Japan is shown by a simple fact: among all the firms battling for Paramount, not one is Japanese. Three years ago, the only place any sensibly greedy Hollywood studio would look for a buyer or for backing was Japan. After all, in 1989 Sony paid $3.4 billion for Columbia Pictures, owner of the Columbia and Tri-Star studios, and in 1990 Matsushita paid $6.1 billion for MCA, owner of Universal Studios -- still the biggest-ever Japanese takeover in America.",0.0,-0.802,-0.802,"     Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

True, these deals -- between U.S. West and Time Warner, Nynex and Viacom, Bell Atlantic and T.C.I. -- raise serious questions about the concentration of power in America's hottest growth industry.

The coming together of television, telecommunications and computer technologies at some time in the future has become popularly known as the information highway -- an evocative image, but a flawed one.

The Clinton Administration wants to create a Federal Banking Commission that would absorb most of the regulatory roles of the Fed, the F.D.I.C. and the Treasury. But the bankers endorsed the Fed's plan, which calls for it to take over the bank supervision role of the F.D.I.C. [ Page 39. ] Cigarettes may be subject to regulation, the F.D.A. suggested, saying there was mounting evidence that cigarettes are sold to satisfy an addiction. [ 1. ] Markets Big global investors have taken hits recently because of a rise in U.S. interest rates and the collapse of trade talks between Japan and the United States. One of the biggest hits was taken by George Soros. The financier, famous for his successful investments in currencies, gold and real estate, lost $600 million in a single day's trading, betting the wrong way on the direction of the yen. [ 39. ] A big mutual fund had to withdraw a $1.1 billion public offering because of an incorrect chart in the offering's prospectus. Stock prices, meanwhile, were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped, but broader indexes gained. [ 40. ] Market watchers were stopped cold as their Bloomberg Business News monitors ground to temporary halt, overwhelmed by subscribers trying to read a single news brief: Nancy Kerrigan finished second in the women's figure-skating competition. [ 41. ] Treasury prices bounced back a bit, and a jittery market was calmer after a week of rising interest rates. [ 48. ] The dollar fell against most major currencies amid wariness before a meeting of the Group of Seven. Gold prices rose. [ 47. ] Lumber prices declined as demand for building materials was smothered by snow. Crude oil prices retreated. [ 47. ] The total number of shares sold short in Nasdaq trading rose to record levels in the month that ended on Feb. 8. [ 51. ] Companies Bell Atlantic's loss of a merger deal may be A.T.& T.'s gain. A merger of Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications would have created a company with lines running past nearly 40 percent of all American homes. The emerging marketplace for interactive services needs such a company with the power to combine disparate telephone and cable television networks, and only A.T.& T. appears to possess that kind of technological might. [ 39. ] Hearst decided it would keep its book division, which includes William Morrow and Avon Books, after months of negotiations on a sale. Putnam Berkley Group had been seen as the likely buyer. [ 39. ] America West's board has endorsed a $220 million bid from an investment group led by the chairman of Continental Airlines. The interest in America West, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, shows a renewed confidence in formerly troubled airlines. [ 41. ] Woolworth said it would report a loss for the fourth quarter, surprising investors. The retailer also said it would take a larger charge than originally estimated in the sale of a Canadian unit. [ 41. ] Westinghouse will acquire the radar and electronic surveillance unit of United Technologies for an undisclosed price. [ 41. ] Your Money Owning a house may be the American dream, but renting one makes more sense for many people. [ 37. ] A private hedge fund is one vehicle that allows investors to make money in falling markets as well as rising markets. [ 37. ] Errors in a a brokerage account can happen, often because of human failing or a computer glitch. But correcting errors requires a quick response and detailed records. [ 37. ] Some mortgage lenders are willing to help borrowers with flexible terms and assistance when there is a disaster like the California earthquake. Others are not so accommodating.

But last week, the two compnies said, Never mind: The numbers don't add up. Why did the deal crash? The F.C.C. lowering cable rates played a part, and T.C.I.'s aggreasive manner did clash with staid Bell Atlantic. But more likely it just wasn't time for the cable industry to disappear into some labyrinthine, futuristic world.

143,383,383,1995-04-30 01:00:00,DIARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/30/business/diary-741295.html,"TAKEOVERS The Day Chrysler Fever Broke Two weeks ago, Chrysler's stock soared -- simply because one man, Kirk Kerkorian, said he wanted to buy the company. Since then, the stock has done a tentative dance, with doubts creeping in about the deal but investors, remembering the power of Mr. Kerkorian's 10 percent stake, not quite ready to bail out. But last week the company lashed out at its uninvited suitor, saying it had no interest in ""gambling with Chrysler's future"" and brushing off Mr. Kerkorian's request for a tripling of the dividend (which would add over $100 million to Mr. Kerkorian's annual income). For investors, that seemed to settle it, as the stock fell $2.50 on Wednesday, close to its pre-hysteria level, before creeping up again by week's end. THE ECONOMY Slowing to a Steady Walk Surprise! Interest rates went up -- thanks to the Federal Reserve -- and people stopped buying so much stuff. At the end of last year, Americans were still spending big, and the economy grew at a fast 5.1 percent pace -- just the type of too-frantic growth the Fed wanted to head off. But in this year's first quarter, reality set in, wallets closed -- well, part way -- and economic growth slowed to a 2.8 percent rate, the laziest in two years. Keeping things going were corporations that made big investments in equipment and buildings. All this was apparently fine with the stock market, as the Dow industrials kept bumping along to new records. MUTUAL FUNDS Follow the Money Trail Mutual funds are where the nation's money is, so their vital signs provide good indicators of what, in an economic sense, is going on. If, that is, you can make sense of those vital signs. Last week came word that cash levels in stock funds were down to 7 percent -- the lowest in well over a decade. What's cash for? Basically, redemptions and safety. But with money flowing in and stocks rising, fund managers seem worried about neither. Fund cash is often what powers the market, though, so is this thin wallet worrisome? Not as long as new cash keeps coming -- which it certainly did recently, going into retirement accounts before the dreaded April 17. THE WORKPLACE Those Vanishing Benefits Most employees already know this, of course: companies are getting stingier with benefits. Workers are paying a bigger share of health coverage or being nudged into H.M.O.'s, and must take greater responsibility for retirement through 401(k)'s and the like. But now it's official. A report last week showed that benefit costs for the first quarter showed the smallest rise in eight years. For the past year, in fact, benefit costs rose no faster than overall compensation -- again, for the first time in eight years. The overall report ""confirms that there's no inflation push from wages,"" said Labor Secretary Reich. It also confirms that the days of the all-giving, kindly-uncle employer are vanishing fast. ANTITRUST One Microsoft, Indivisible Soon, no doubt, there'll be a Government agency called the Microsoft Department, or at least a Microsoft Division at the Justice Department. The giant company seems a perennial Washington topic. Just last week Justice officials were defending Microsoft one minute against being called monopolistic and then going to court to block its acquisition of Intuit, maker of Quicken personal-finance software, saying this dominance could lead to higher prices and fewer choices for consumers. No inconsistency, the agency said -- different legal issues. And there's no truth, by the way, to rumors that Microsoft is planning to acquire the Justice Department. Just the mint. BANKING A Human Teller? Naw! In the old days, we'll tell our grandchildren (by e-mail, of course), you actually saw people at bank windows, talked to human beings on the phone, not multiple-choice recordings. They'll smile an indulgent smile, then log on to their sixth-grade math class. It's true, though. Until late April of '95, you could walk into any bank and hand a teller a deposit. But then First Chicago said you had to pay $3 for that honor (unless you had $2,500 stagnating in a checking account) if you could have used an A.T.M. instead. A teller transaction, you see, costs 6 to 12 times what an A.T.M. transaction does, and they had to watch all those pennies. Even though, in yet older days, the world somehow muddled through with -- brace yourselves -- no A.T.M.'s at all. ORANGE COUNTY Mr. Citron Takes His Lumps ""The dog ate my homework"" may work for a young scholar, but for grown-ups, ""the broker ate my lunch"" goes only so far. When you're managing a $7.4 billion government fund, as Robert Citron was in Orange County, you're ultimately responsible. For a while, Mr. Citron insisted he was just a blushing victim when the county lost $1.7 billion, blaming Merrill Lynch for leading him astray, but last week that excuse crumbled when he pleaded guilty to felonies like misappropriating funds and misleading investors. He could get up to 14 years in prison. In other words, derivatives don't make money vanish; people do. INNER CITY Bodegas vs. Pathmark You can't win. In some people's view, the inner city perpetuates poverty partly because a lack of fair-priced supermarkets forces residents to shop at high-priced bodegas. But when a plan emerged for a Pathmark in East Harlem, opponents cried out that the store would hurt bodega owners. The plan seemed doomed right up to the last minute, but then a City Councilman switched sides and the Manhattan Borough Board approved it, the lure of low prices and added jobs apparently winning the day. TECHNOLOGY High-Tech Coffee Break Sometimes we seem to be rushing headlong into a world with all the high-tech stuff jumbled together -- television shows coming out of phones, phone calls coming out of computers, information coming from just about anywhere. But occasionally the world pauses on this mad dash, as when Bell Atlantic decided last week to rethink its idea of offering video services to three million phone customers. Even though the company was well along in the F.C.C. approval process, it said its executives needed to ""to catch our breath."" So does this point, as some suggested, to mounting confusion in this whole pile-up of technologies? Or does Bell Atlantic just want, as it says, to hold out for better fiber-optic technology? Stay, uh, tuned. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION And the Sons Did Homework Thursday was Take Our Daughters to Work Day, a jubilant little affirmative-action idea cooked up a few years ago by the Ms. Foundation. Nationwide, perhaps six million girls played hooky to get a glimpse of the way the adult world works -- or at least the way it works with six million rosy little souls playing hopscotch in the staid hallways of commerce. But ""affirmative action"" is a dirty word these days -- O.K., two words -- so the glee is now tempered with dissension. Why were boys left out? They get precious little chance to watch Dad -- and Mom -- work. Not to mention that if they saw women doing all sorts of jobs, a lesson might sink in. Then again, why shouldn't girls hog the spotlight for a day? Then again . . . oh, who knows.",0.0,0.9919,0.9919,"                Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The Dow edged up 0.69 point, to 4,341.33, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 0.39 point, to 519.19. Stock traders snapped up some newly cheap stocks, including the blue-chip stocks they had pummeled the day before. For the week, the Dow lost 89.23 points.

Icahn has been buying up the debt of Rockefeller Center Properties, the real estate investment trust that holds the $1.3 billion mortgage on Rockefeller Center. Traders said that Mr. Icahn's investment firm has been accumulating the trust's bonds since two partnerships that own Rockefeller Center filed for bankruptcy on May 11.

Republicans forced the vote, just as Democratic Congresses often did during the Reagan and Bush years, to embarrass the White House. Democrats agreed ahead of time that all would vote against the measure, which was sure to lose. During the listless debate that preceded the budget vote, no Democrat bothered to defend the President.

The Treasury Department said receipts totaled $165.4 billion last month, while spending was $115.7 billion. The Government normally operates at a surplus in April because of the tax filing deadline. [ 38. ] Honda Says Profits Doubled Honda said its group net income in the latest fiscal year rose for the first time in six years, more than doubling to $708 million, as higher sales in North America, Europe and Japan offset the effects of the strong yen.

Frederick A.

A Federal appeals court in Richmond ruled last November that the prohibition was an unconstitutional burden on the telephone companies' right of free speech, preventing them from communicating over their own networks with their desired audience. Phone companies have been bringing and winning First Amendment challenges to the policy in Federal courts around the country.

A fourth Baby Bell said profit fell because of increased competition. The Bell Atlantic Corporation said second-quarter net income rose 7.7 percent, and the Ameritech Corporation posted a 13 percent increase. The BellSouth Corporation reported a 7.8 percent increase in operating profit, but charges resulted in a loss for the quarter.

Acquiring Capital Cities/ABC Inc. was a deal at a mere $19 billion. After all, back in 1986 when the media merger frenzy first got under way, General Electric paid $6.5 billion for the RCA Corporation (which owns NBC), and just two years ago Bell Atlantic offered $33 billion in a failed bid for Tele-Communications Inc., the largest cable company in the world. The fashionable term for all this vertical and lateral corporate integration is synergy, but synergy turns out to be just another word for monopoly. The Disney acquisition is the latest manifestation of irresistible global economic and technological forces demanding integration and uniformity.

The merger would likely reduce the number of phone companies that will compete for local phone customers, thus lessening the incentive to offer lower prices or better service. But the two companies might be able to show that the merger will create large savings that can be passed along to customers. The Justice Department and Federal regulators owe consumers a probing investigation before they grant approval. The merged company would be the second-largest telecommunications firm, exceeded only by AT&T, with about $25 billion in revenues, 35 million customers and 130,000 employees spread out over 12 Eastern states. Bell Atlantic and Nynex do not serve the same households, so there will be no immediate effect on competition for the business of local phone customers. The merger might nevertheless help customers if it produces substantial cost savings. New Yorkers can also take heart that Bell Atlantic's well-regarded management will almost certainly improve the erratic customer service now provided by Nynex.",0.0,0.9699,0.9699,"             Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Are we moving toward a new national monopoly -- like the old Bell system, before it was broken up -- with control over cable TV and other media? That is the wrong question. Nationally, there is now more choice in the communications field. In the early 1980's, AT&T controlled 80 percent of local telephone service and almost all long-distance service. Today, it has about 55 percent of the long-distance market and that will erode more as the Baby Bells compete.

With the Dow Jones industrial average up 8.3 percent this month, several big fund companies, including John Hancock, Smith Barney, Vanguard, Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments, reported that cash flows into stock funds in November were well ahead of last month's flows. $(Page A1.$) The Dow average took a breather from its record-breaking run, falling 19.38 points to 6,528.41, but the Nasdaq composite rose 0.83 to 1,281.20, its second straight closing high. $(D6.$) Treasury securities prices were mixed as traders took profits on early gains that followed a report by the Conference Board that its consumer confidence index held steady in November. The yield on the 30-year bond edged up to 6.44 percent. $(D16.$) Disney Earnings Climb 27% The Walt Disney Company reported a 27 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit to $336 million, helped by record theme park attendance and its ''Aladdin and the King of Thieves'' video. With Capital Cities/ABC it had net income of $354 million. Its stock surged $2.50, to $76, following the report. $(D3.$) Disney said it would release ''Kundun,'' a new Martin Scorsese film about the life of the Dalai Lama, despite a warning by the Chinese Government not to do so. $(C9.$) Lehman's President Resigns T. Christopher Pettit, 51, resigned as president of Lehman Brothers, months after stepping down as chief operating officer, ceding power to younger senior executives. $(D2.$) Primark Deal for Baseline Expected Primark, continuing its rapid growth in the financial information business, is expected to announce it has acquired Baseline Financial Services for $40 million in cash from Bowne & Company and Baseline's founder. $(D16.$) A Snag in Nynex Merger Plans The staff of the New York State Public Service Commission opposed approval of the proposed merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic unless Nynex agrees to compensate customers for the loss of a potential competitor -- by cutting rates, for example. $(B1.$) Hughes in Japanese Space Deal Hughes Electronics became the first company to sign up to launch commercial satellites on a Japanese rocket being developed. $(D5.$) Swiss Bank to Make Big Cuts Union Bank of Switzerland said it would cut 800 jobs and take a special charge of $2.3 billion that will result in a 1996 loss. $(D5.$) Russia Drops Western Advisers The Russian State Property Committee dropped its Western advisers, led by N. M. Rothschild & Sons, for the planned sale of shares in RAO Svyazinvest, which controls most of Russia's local phone companies. $(D5.$) Owners Back Baseball Agreement Baseball club owners ratified an accord that assures the first labor peace in major league baseball in four years and paves the way for interleague play, a luxury tax on payrolls, a revenue-sharing plan to transfer $40 million to poorer clubs and a search for a commissioner. $(A1.$) A.A.R.P.

Made nervous by a weaker dollar, many investors sold Treasury securities ahead of today's employment report. The yield of 6.50 percent on the 30-year Treasury bond was up from 6.39 percent on Wednesday and matched the highest yield in nearly a month. $(Page D13.$) Asian markets reacted strongly to the bond activity in the United States and to the remarks of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. The Nikkei index dropped 3.19 percent and the Hang Seng index was down more than 4 percent in late trading. $(Page D6.$) Circuit Breaker Shift Sought; Dow and Nasdaq Make Small Gains The New York Stock Exchange proposed making the circuit breakers that halt trading when prices plunge less restrictive than they are now -- though still far tighter than when they were introduced in 1988. The Dow industrials gained 14.16 points, closing at 6,437.10, and the Nasdaq composite rose 3.10 points, to 1,300.12; broader averages fell. $(D6.$) Imported Cars Roaring Back Japanese and European auto makers have come roaring back to the United States, by cutting prices and increasing rebates, moves made possible by the dollar's surge in the last year. Consequently, Detroit faces its toughest competition since the early 1990's. $(A1.$) Chrysler Moves Reflect Success With brisk sales of Jeeps and mini-vans producing a torrent of cash, Chrysler said that it would raise its quarterly dividend, buy back more stock and make management changes to reward executives responsible for its success. Robert A. Lutz, its president, will stay on past the retirement age of 65 as vice chairman. $(D3.$) Nippon Telephone to Restructure In a restructuring that would reshape Japanese telecommunications, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone agreed to split into a long-distance service provider and two regional companies for local service. $(D2.$) N.A.S.D.

He may also have surprised Gov. George Pataki, who would probably rather not offend Nynex, a powerful constituent, or thwart a merger that promises to base itself in New York City. But Mr. Vacco's brief, filed with the Public Service Commission, is a cogent reminder why the merger could harm New Yorkers. Mr. Vacco points out that in the absence of a merger Bell Atlantic might, under the new telecommunications law, enter the New York market and compete for Nynex's customers. Indeed, Bell Atlantic once planned to provide local phone service by joining forces with a major cable operator. If the state approves the proposed merger, Nynex would be immunized against Bell Atlantic's presence. Mr. Vacco also fears that the proposed mega-company would scare others out of entering the local market, entrenching a monopoly, Nynex, which has a dismal customer-service record.",0.1531,-0.8148,-0.781,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

By the old rule, man must bite dog -- the opposite occurrence being so commonplace that it's not worth noting. So how about when the Dow industrials put another 1,000-point notch in their belt? The first few times it was sort of exciting -- but the milestones are being toppled so regularly now that it's rapidly sinking to the dog-bites-man category. The Dow topped 7,000 last week, you say? Hmmm. That and 20 redials might, if you're lucky, get you onto America Online. Why do stocks keep rising? Oh, round up the usual suspects: mutual fund money, low inflation, corporate profits, blah blah blah. And the pundits, with remarkably precise hindsight, are scrambling to say that, well, the rules have changed about what defines an overpriced market. Famous last words? WAGES A Raise? What a Thought Inflation's all but dead. The grim downsizing reaper still loiters on the street corner. A cost-of-living raise? Ha! Just be thankful you have a job -- and, while you're at it, grovel a bit. Yes, this is the way it was, but guess what: it's not really true any more. Employers nationwide are finding that they simply can't afford to keep being stingy, and wages are now rising at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, half a point above the inflation rate. No, that can't match the solid raises of the good old days -- the 60's and 70's -- but it's quite a change from the past few years, when raises all but vanished for many workers. So go ahead. Ask for a raise. For a change, the statistics are on your side. WALL STREET Lamborghinis? I'll Take Two Lest we forget, though: there are wages and there are wages. Light-years apart from the real world of pinched pennies and juggled bills lies the funny-money world of Wall Street, and it's never been funnier. It's the height of bonus season, and we're not talking about a few $100's in an envelope -- not by a long shot. After a giddy year in the markets, the securities industry's 150,000 workers in New York are getting about $8.1 billion in bonuses, far above the previous high of $6.2 billion, with perhaps 1,500 people making $1 million or more. So if you see some smooth-faced hotshots with million-dollar suits and fire in their eyes, better step aside: they've just received their bonus checks and are sprinting for the Lamborghini dealer. PHONE COMPANIES Good Service? Try Asking When Nynex merges with Bell Atlantic this spring, Bell Atlantic, it seems, will be setting the pace -- and that's probably just fine with Nynex customers. In a recent F.C.C. customer-satisfaction ranking, Nynex was a distant last. And last week, in fact, the New York Public Service Commission ordered Nynex to pay $109.6 million to its customers in the state for what it called a decade's worth of bad service. Here's a thought, though: in those droning long-distance wars, bargaining is creeping into the formula. If you don't like, say, 15 cents a minute, call and offer 10 -- and they just might take it. So just take this you've-gotta-ask-for-it approach a step further: Call Nynex (or whomever), and after you've lined up package rates and call-waiting, simply say, ''I'll go for the good service, too, please.'' FOREIGN POLICY A Compromise on Cuba? When historians sum up America's late-20th-century foreign policy, the comic relief will surely be supplied by our mounting frustration with Cuba. Our delicate sensibilities are so offended that this little island, practically on our patio, won't dance to our deafening tune that we come up with all manner of bizarre and convoluted laws to wreak our symbolic vengeance. One of the more bizarre: the Helms-Burton Act, which, basically, decrees that the rest of the world join us in ostracizing Fidel's ruffians -- or else. European nations, not at all happy being bullied this way, planned to take their outrage to the World Trade Organization. And Washington has countered by warning that it would argue -- this gets really strange -- that little Cuba actually poses a security threat. Last week, though, still hoping for a compromise, Europe postponed its challenge. CELLULAR DISTRACTION If You Talk, Don't Drive Status-conscious go-getters wouldn't dream of cruising along in their Grand Cherokees without talking with great earnestness into their cell phones. It's vital, after all, to stay in constant contact with your broker or lawyer or wine consultant -- or at least appear to be. But is this a high-risk status symbol? Common sense has long indicated that it is, but there's been no scientific backing -- until now. A study published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, in which Canadian researchers studied 699 phone-equipped drivers who'd had accidents, found that the risk of an accident rises fourfold when you're talking -- about the same as being legally drunk. There is some talk about restricting drivers' use of phones, but such a drastic step does not seem to be likely. Still, you can almost hear the new terminology: Stop D.W.C. -- driving while chatting. Or C.I. drivers -- conversation-impaired. And, now, it's no joke. GOVERNMENT SPENDING Funds for Family Planning Is family planning just another term for abortion? Abortion foes in the House have long thought so -- or voted so, at any rate, putting tight reins on money for family-planning programs around the world. But last week, prodded by President Clinton, the House voted to speed the release of family-planning money. ''American dollars shouldn't be used to kill innocent little children,'' one Republican argued. But another Republican countered that during every hour that he and his colleagues yammered about the issue, 250 women around the world would die during pregnancy -- deaths that could have been prevented by contraception. This stance won the day, as the House voted 220 to 209 to release $215 million in family planning funds on March 1. If the measure had failed, it would have been just $92 million -- on July 1. SHIFTING ECONOMICS And the Sand Goes Round There's really not much ambiguity left. A beach is washed away, you spend millions to dump more sand on it in a futile attempt to outsmart Parent Nature, and the new sand in turn is washed away. And on and on. But have we learned that beaches simply don't stay put? Of course not. Even now, $450,000 is being spent to dump 50,000 cubic yards of sand on Brant Beach on the New Jersey shore.",0.0,-0.9977,-0.9977,"            Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Terms were not disclosed. Bell Atlantic and DSC, a telecommunications equipment company, filed the suit on Feb. 14, 1996, contending that AT&T had designed its telecommunications switches to prevent the connection of other manufacturers' equipment. The suit, which asked for nearly $3.5 billion in damages, also contended that AT&T sought to monopolize the markets for telecommunications equipment and software and for caller identification services. AT&T had maintained that it did not engage in anticompetitive activities. Separate claims by Bell Atlantic and DSC against Lucent Technologies Inc., the telecommunications equipment maker spun off by AT&T last year, are proceeding.",0.0,-0.7605,-0.7605,"               Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Bell Atlantic and DSC settled claims related to a similar suit against the AT&T Corporation last month. Claims brought against Lucent by DSC and a counterclaim brought by Lucent were voluntarily dismissed. Bell Atlantic and DSC filed suit against AT&T and Lucent in 1996, seeking nearly $3.5 billion in damages. The suit alleged that AT&T designed its telecommunications switches specifically to prevent the interconnection of other manufacturers' equipment. AT&T subsequently filed counterclaims against Bell Atlantic.",0.0,-0.5719,-0.5719,"             Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

At a bipartisan rally, he shared the stage with James Baker, who negotiated the treaty as Secretary of State under President Bush, and other Republicans and military leaders. The pact, already ratified by 70 nations, will take effect on April 29, with or without the United States' participation. 1 Death Stalks Hutu Refugees Hundreds of Hutu refugees from Rwanda have died from weakness and disease in makeshift camps in eastern Zaire, where about 80,000 of them are languishing. A United Nations plan to airlift them to Rwanda from the Kisangani airfield has been stymied by Zairian rebels, who have barred their way. The rebels, mostly ethnic Tutsi from Zaire, said they feared epidemics and the presence of armed Hutu militia leaders. 1 Few Clues on Saudi Bombing The Pentagon lacks adequate evidence about the bombers who killed 19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia last year to warrant retaliation against foreign nations that may have helped them, said Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A senior Pentagon official said the investigation into the bombing was likely to continue for months and might never yield proof of the involvement of a foreign government. 3 Turkey Lashes Out at Germany Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan of Turkey angrily described recent attacks on Turks in Germany as the result of an ''anti-Muslim campaign'' there. A Turkish woman and her two children were killed in an arson attack in Krefeld, which the Turkish Government listed as the 17th such attack in 1997. German officials rejected the accusation and charged the husband and father of the arson victims with setting the fire. More than two million Turks live in Germany. 3 Strikes Proliferate in France Strikes and the threat of more have swept across France. Pilots, hospital interns and bank employees have stopped work, and truck drivers have threatened to repeat their strike of last November. Unemployment, at 12.8 percent, is higher than ever, and the popularity of President Jacques Chirac has plummeted, according to polls. The strikers object to cuts in wages and state-mandated benefits they have won over the years. 4 Inmates Seize Colombia Jail Inmates angry about prison conditions in Valledupar in northern Colombia released 2 of at least 10 hostages seized in a violent takeover but demanded bulletproof vests and helicopters before they freed the rest. Four guards were killed when about 10 inmates seized control of the prison on Thursday. The two released were a female guard and a teen-age girl who had been delivering a birthday greeting. (AP) NATIONAL 8-12 Space Shuttle Lifts Off For Study of Gravity The space shuttle Columbia was launched on a 16-day mission to study the subtleties of what happens in the absence of gravity. The shuttle, with a crew of seven, lifted off about 20 minutes later than scheduled and was watched by large crowds. 10 An American astronaut and two Russian compatriots on the Mir space station began relying on a backup air-purification system after the main device to remove carbon dioxide overheated. 10 Changes Reshaping F.A.A. Under a new policy that has been in effect for only a few weeks, the Federal Aviation Administration is announcing major violations by airlines and the fines levied in those cases. But the agency will still not say how serious some of the violations may be or compare the violations at one airline with those at another. 11 Pilots' Contract Advances A tentative contract between American Airlines and its pilots' union won the endorsement of the group's leaders and will be sent to the union's 9,300 members for a ratification vote early next month. 11 Blood Tests Tell Expected Tale Most of the 39 Heaven's Gate cult members who committed suicide at a California house had taken a lethal combination of drugs and alcohol before dying, the results of blood tests showed. 12 Gallo Wineries Win in Court A Federal jury in San Francisco ruled that the E.& J. Gallo Winery had not tried to deceive consumers by using a bottle that one of California's most successful premium vintners said shared some characteristics of its bottles. 10 Cocaine Found Among Bananas The Alabama State Police found more than 1,100 pounds of cocaine hidden in a truckload of bananas. The police released the driver of the tractor-trailer after concluding he did not know he was carrying the drugs. State troopers made the find while conducting safety inspections on Interstate 65. (AP) NEW YORK/REGION 23-27 Getting Concert Tickets Was Wrong, Rowland Says Gov. John G. Rowland, the first baby boomer to hold Connecticut's highest office, today admitted to violating state ethics laws and blamed a culprit that has swayed so many in his generation: rock and roll. Mr. Rowland has agreed to pay a $2,000 fine for accepting discounted tickets to six concerts from a lobbyist and other third parties. He also said he would donate the value of the tickets -- $1,919 -- to charity. 26 Messinger Criticizes Sharpton The peace that had enveloped the Democratic mayoral contest appears to have been shattered. Ruth W. Messinger condemned the Rev. Al Sharpton for saying he did not consider Louis Farrakhan an anti-Semite, saying such words would ''only serve to tear us apart.'' 23 Insurance Overhaul Less Likely Prospects that Governor Whitman's plan for a major overhaul of car insurance in New Jersey will be approved by Election Day have dimmed. Twice in recent days, she has been quoted as saying she is uncertain about chances of winning legislative approval of her reform plan by November. 24 Arrest in Dominican Republic Francisco Medina, whose handiwork on the behalf of drug gangs in the early 1990's, officials say, soaked the streets of the South Bronx and upper Manhattan with blood, has been arrested in the Dominican Republic. 25 SPORTS 29-33 ARTS 13-19, 22 BUSINESS DAY 34-47 Unemployment Rate Drops The unemployment rate edged down to 5.2 percent last month -- matching its lowest level in eight years -- as the reinvigorated economy continued to improve the labor market. That may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. 1 Stock Market Rebounds Despite the threat of higher interest rates, the stock market showed new signs of life, rallying late in the day to put a temporary cap on what had become the market's biggest downturn in two years. The Dow industrials gained 48.72 points. For the week, the Dow lost 215 points. 36 Office-Supply Merger Blocked The Federal Trade Commission rejected the proposed $4 billion merger of two office supply discounters, Staples and Office Depot, setting the stage for a possible court battle. The action reflects a growing aggressiveness in antitrust enforcement. 1 Plan Would Raise Phone Bills AT&T, Bell Atlantic and Nynex made a proposal to eliminate $2.5 billion in subsidies from the telephone industry while increasing local phone bills by 75 cents a month.

But that increase excluded a one-time gain of $142.1 million that Bell Atlantic recorded in the first quarter of 1996 as a result of a change in its accounting methods.

For years, my car radio faded as I entered the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, remaining silent for the duration of the trip. Now it plays from one end to the other. What happened? A. Last month, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority let Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile, a Nynex subsidiary, install something called a leaky coaxial cable along the entire 9,117-foot length of the tunnel, according to Frank Pascual, a spokesman for M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels. The cable, about twice as thick as a typical television cable, acts as a continuous, insulated antenna that receives AM, FM, emergency band and two-way radio signals inside the 47-year-old tunnel as well as allowing mobile phone and beeper use.",0.0,0.2023,0.2023,"Empty DataFrame

Imagine your company was in an industry whose products were so harmful to society that it was negotiating to pay $250 billion -- yes, billion; up there with the Federal budget deficit -- over 25 years to get itself off the hook. Sounds devastating, no? But when the possibility of a sweeping tobacco settlement broke into the open last week, shares of both Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco leapt more than 10 percent. That sum, you see, staggering as it sounds, at least sets a limit on the tab of the cigarette makers, which are under vast legal pressure to pick up a good part of the nation's health care cost from smoking-related illness. And remember that the tobacco giants practically mint money -- Philip Morris just reported profits of $1.77 billion for a single quarter. It brings to mind the cartoon that depicted Michael R. Milken, after agreeing to pay $500 million in compensation for his misdeeds, looking up at the judge with a wide smile and saying, ''Cash or check?'' ADVERTISING High Noon in Marlboro Country The people negotiating the tobacco deal are reportedly considering a ban on, among other things, human characters in ads. But that would be ''a deal breaker,'' one analyst said. ''There is no chance in the world Philip Morris would agree to do away with the Marlboro Man.'' The ''Marlboro Country'' ads, after all, have had a bigger impact on the world's smoking than any other campaign. (John Landry, who oversaw development of the Marlboro Country ads in the early 60's, died last week at 73.) STOCK MARKET 10%? Time to Buy Again The stock market has all these odd little myths and formulas. If something happens in January, something else is supposed to happen in June. If a certain team wins the Super Bowl, it's curtains for stocks. And, of course, there's the old 10 percent rule: if the Dow industrials ever drop 10 percent from their high, that's heavy-duty stuff -- not to mention the end of the bull market as we know it. For six long years -- the longest stretch ever -- the Dow has skirted such a fate, but last week it danced on the precipice. After ending the previous Friday down 9.8 percent, the Dow ventured down into the danger zone on Monday. But then investors -- duly programmed to follow their myth -- seemed to say, ''Hey, we've had our heavy-duty market drop; now the water's safe again.'' And the Dow bounded back to gain 60 points, and 135 more on Tuesday, and it kept rising most of the rest of the week. TAX RETURNS Sacrificing for Politics President Clinton, often accused of just saying what people want to hear, didn't miss a beat last week. For even as Americans were racing against the tax deadline and swearing at the tangle of forms, Mr. Clinton offered a plan to simplify the whole process. Sounds familiar. Politicians talk constantly of tax simplification. One fun thing about tax time, though -- yes, yes, it's a stretch to call any of it fun -- is that the simple folk get to peek at politicians' returns. Last year, both Mr. Clinton and Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani, powerful as they are, made far less than their wives. President Clinton had his $200,000 salary, but Hillary Rodham Clinton made $740,000 on royalties from ''It Takes a Village'' (most of which she has donated to charity). And while Mr. Guiliani's salary is $165,000, Donna Hanover made $259,000 as an actress and TV journalist. THE GREAT UNTAXED Well, There's Still Death Those First Families, of course, also paid hefty taxes -- they'd never try the type of shenanigans most Americans seem to believe are hidden somewhere in the fine print of the Declaration of Independence. You'd think, for instance, that people making over $200,000, no matter how much tax-return creativity they mustered, would have to turn over at least a few pennies to the I.R.S. Not so. In 1993, according to the latest I.R.S. data, nearly 2,400 Americans with such lofty incomes paid precisely nothing in Federal taxes -- nearly 30 times as many as in 1977. One way they did it: someone could, say, earn $1 million, but lose $1 million (on paper) on a real estate investment and wipe out any liability. So much for the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to wipe out such stuff. LIFE INSURANCE H.I.V. Policies, at a Price Life insurance for someone who's H.I.V.-positive? Forget it. No insurer would touch you -- until now, that is. Last week, Guarantee Trust Life, of Glenview, Ill., became the first to offer such coverage, recognizing that new drug therapies mean that AIDS is no longer hopeless. For now, the policies are offered only in Illinois, but later they may be more widely available, and those who contracted the virus through drug use aren't eligible -- the company deems them too risky. But here's the big catch: a $250,000 policy costs $1,500 a month, or $18,000 a year. WIRELESS PHONES Phone-aholics, Please Apply These ads for wireless phones are getting downright silly. As competition heats up -- with new rivals for Bell Atlantic Nynex and AT&T Wireless in the New York area, and with new goodies like digital service -- innocent bystanders are being bombarded with pitches that often include absurd numbers of free minutes. One, for instance, offers 1,000 free weekend minutes a month. Think about it. That's two full hours, every weekend day. How would you ever use that? Take a six-mile hike and talk to your broker the whole time? Sit at a Little League game and chat endlessly on the phone instead of watching the field? Farfetched? Not necessarily. Bargain-hunting Americans just hate to get something free and not use it. If phone companies were sincerely interested in quality of life, they might offer incentives for people not to use these gadgets. HEALTH CARE All-in-One Cancer Care Say you need a widget. You go to the widget store, which might well be owned, or at least managed, by the widget maker. Sounds reasonable. But is health care just another business? Should it be? With the rapid growth of managed care, of course, health is getting to be very much a business, and when you consider things like efficiency and economy of scale, that might well be a good thing indeed. But is there a limit? That was the question last week when Zeneca, the British company that's the world's No. 2 maker of cancer drugs, took over the operation of its 11 cancer centers in the United States. ''This arrangement is a first,'' one analyst said. And no doubt not the last. CONTINENTAL WORLD Coffee, Tea or Broadway? Just as Florida has Disney World, for years New York had Webber World (though purists insisted on calling it ''Broadway''). But when ''Sunset Boulevard'' closed a few weeks ago, suddenly Times Square no longer seemed like Andrew Lloyd Webber's private playground. Never fear, though: the urge to make it a theme park hasn't died. Now, if you please, call it Continental World. When you weren't looking, the theater district somehow turned itself into a brand name, and last week the new, improved Broadway landed its first national corporate sponsor -- Continental Airlines. What now? ''We plan to do this tie-in very tastefully,'' said the president of the ''official airline of Broadway.'' And a theater official vowed that there'll be no ''dancing airliners in the middle of shows.'' Only, presumably, at curtain time.",0.0,0.9958,0.9958,"           Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Conservative Republicans had opposed the treaty, but Mr. Lott said he decided to back it after receiving a letter from President Clinton promising to withdraw if it compromised the nation's military capabilities. A1 A Mother Lode of Dinosaurs A huge trove of dinosaur fossils that includes the first fossilized internal organs of dinosaurs ever seen and the first fossil of a dinosaur containing a mammal it had just eaten has been discovered in a remote region of northeast China, scientists announced. More than 200 fossils of a primitive bird, plus mammals, insects and plants, were also found. A1 Anger at Guerrillas' Treatment Unidentified Peruvian officials and former hostages accused the Peruvian military of executing some guerrillas who were trying to surrender during the raid to free their hostages. The Government said the guerrillas' bodies would be buried in unmarked graves, prompting protests from their relatives. A1 British Campaign in Final Week Tony Blair and his Labor Party colleagues strove to keep their commanding lead in the polls from collapsing as the final week of campaigning in Britain began. Mr. Blair stressed what his party would not do if elected next Thursday. Prime Minister John Major and his Tories, who have been in power for the last 18 years, sought to emphasize the country's economic achievements. A5 Rwandan Refugees Disappear United Nations officials said tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees had abandoned a camp near Kisangani in Zaire after three days of confused fighting. Aid workers and journalists escorted by Zairian rebels to the site found nothing but debris. It was unclear where the refugees had gone. The rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, denied his forces had killed them. A6 Japan Guru Pleads Not Guilty Shoko Asahara, the guru of the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult, pleaded not guilty to being the mastermind of the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway that killed a dozen people and injured thousands more. In a baffling monologue that often slipped into broken English and drew jeers from the court audience, Mr. Asahara blamed two aides, saying they did not obey his orders to abort the sarin gas attack two days before it occurred. A7 France Seeks to Deal With Cuba France said it would sign an accord protecting and promoting investments with Cuba. American officials were not invited to the signing; they said they were not surprised or offended by the deal.

A16 Mystery Package at B'nai Brith The authorities in Washington, D.C., sealed off the world headquarters of B'nai Brith with 108 people inside after a mail room employee noticed a foul odor emanating from an envelope marked ''anthrachs.'' The occupants were allowed to go home more than eight hours later after tests found that the contents were not anthrax, a deadly bacterium. A12 '91 Gas Attack Called Possible A respected chemical-weapons researcher who had been mysteriously dismissed from a special White House panel said he believed Iraq might have attacked American troops with chemical weapons during the 1991 war, something the Pentagon has repeatedly denied. A15 Universe's Shape Is Disputed Two scientists said an assertion that the universe has an ''up'' and a ''down'' was based on a statistical flaw. The authors of the original study stood by their work.

276,679,679,1997-04-27 01:00:00,DIARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/27/business/diary-807850.html,"DAUGHTERS AT WORK Hopes, Not Sweatshops For many girls, Take Our Daughters to Work Day is a joyous, silly, possibly inspiring once-a-year event. For others, it is not a lark at all -- no giddy photocopying of hands or, perhaps, shoes at Dad's office -- but a day-in, day-out grind, because some girls spend their days shut up in New York garment factories. They might be 13-year-olds sweating at sewing machines, or 3-year-olds playing on the floor, and many are struggling Chinese immigrants. Now, as a protest, the nation's largest clothing union has piggybacked on the daughters'-day publicity bandwagon and created Don't Bring Our Daughters to Work Day. And it wants it observed every day. Does this offend the Ms. Foundation, mother of the original daughters' day? Not at all. ''It's great,'' the foundation's president said. She wondered, though, if society had the will to provide an alternative. ''Where,'' she asked, ''is the village?'' TELEPHONES Yearning to Be AT&T? Step by step, inch by inch, like shards of shattered glass straining to reassemble themselves, the telephone industry is moving relentlessly toward consolidation. Not that the latest step wasn't a struggle. It's been a whole year since Bell Atlantic and Nynex pledged to join into a mighty whole, and the Justice Department sniffed long and hard for antitrust scents. Many consumer advocates were wary, with one decrying ''the avalanche of telecommunications mergers'' driving prices up. But last week, removing the last real hurdle, the Justice Department signed off on the deal anyway, saying it spied no antitrust problems. The head of Bell Atlantic assured customers that ''telephone bills will go down,'' but one thing is certain: People who only recently started writing checks to Nynex, not New York Telephone, will be paying their bills to a Bell Atlantic that sprawls from Maine to Virginia. RATING CONSUMER REPORTS Samurai Strikes Back Would the folks at Consumers Union ever cheer as they tested products? Unthinkable. If ever a publication had a reputation for sober objectivity, it is their magazine, Consumer Reports. The thing practically drips with integrity -- at least that's the image it has doggedly built. Last week, though, Suzuki tried to poke a hole in that wall of virtue. Suzuki's Samurai, of course, also has an image indelibly rooted in the public mind: that it might tip over as you meander along a country lane. That blot on its good name, of course, came in 1988, when Consumer Reports gave the Samurai its damning ''Not Acceptable'' label, causing sales to plunge. Now, nearly a decade later, Suzuki says it was the testing that was not acceptable, accusing Consumer Reports of setting out to make the car tip just for the sake of a good story, with testers cheering when they finally succeeded. The magazine said the test was valid. RENOVATIONS (ENDLESS) Grand Central's Vital Signs Grand Central has been transformed forever into a construction wasteland, a labyrinth whose meandering plywood byways seem to change by the day. That, at least, is the way commuters see it, as the vast renovation drags on. And on. But the end is in sight -- late 1998, officials say -- and you know it's true because the capitalist wheels are most definitely turning. The 180,000 square feet earmarked for restaurants and stores is going fast, with likely tenants including Gotham Bar and Grill, Banana Republic, the downright oxymoronic Caviarteria, and -- did you doubt it for a second? -- Starbucks. New York, you see, couldn't stand being upstaged by Washington, with its glorious Union Station. And it won't be: Union Station doesn't have that glorious star-spangled ceiling. BLOCKBUSTER DREAMS Watch Out for 'Titanic'! When you come right down to it, the movie business in summer is nothing but a huge, vaguely comic game of musical chairs, with 300-pound bruisers dancing desperately around the same pitiful scattering of chairs. Those chairs, of course, are summer weekends, and no matter how big and fancy and high-tech the movies get, Hollywood simply can't create more of these prize landing slots. A blockbuster wannabe, you see, craves nothing more than having an opening weekend to itself. Moviegoers dutifully flood the theaters, and almighty box-office momentum is achieved. This summer is shaping up as an especially lively game: 10 weeks, at least 15 aspiring mega-hits. And to spice things up, ''Titanic'' -- the heftiest of them all, costing at least $180 million -- is having trouble deciding which chair to grab. It was set for the Fourth of July weekend, but might face a delay -- something to do with computer effects. If it plops itself down on another weekend, there'll be a mad scramble indeed. FORGOTTEN HOLLYWOOD You Must Remember This Yes, there's big money floating around Hollywood -- those summer biggies cost a staggering $100 million or more apiece. But it's instant money, somehow -- money with no memory, no past. Movies themselves, of course, are imbedded in memory -- any film buff can quote half of ''Casablanca,'' or summon instantly the image of Fay Wray wriggling and screaming in ''King Kong.'' But do Hollywood's millions keep flowing to the creators of those classics? No, not even thousands, not even hundreds. Julius Epstein, co-author of ''Casablanca,'' got $15,000 -- and nothing since. Well, almost nothing. He got $600 in 1960, but that covered past residuals for 35 films. Ms. Wray's husband, Robert Riskin, wrote classics like ''Meet John Doe,'' but there was not even enough money for his care after he had a stroke in 1950. Ms. Wray and Mr. Epstein, both 89, were among a Hollywood contingent that descended on Washington last week to lobby for a copyright law that would share the wealth of pre-1960 movies. In a business of ''$90 million severance packages,'' said Billy Wilder, the director whose films included ''Some Like It Hot,'' ''writers are just asking for enough to buy a little schnitzel.'' 58-CENT DREAM HOMES Many Rms, Lky Dungeon When it comes to dream homes, there are fixer-uppers and there are fixer-uppers. Sometimes a coat of paint and a bit of window caulking will do; other times you'll have flooded dungeons or crumbling turrets. Dungeons? Turrets? Yes, all this and more can be yours -- and for the pauperly sum of 58 cents, or one German mark. Eastern Germany, you see, has all these gorgeous old castles that are falling apart -- far too gorgeous, not to mention historic, to tear down. So, as a test, it's offering three of them for a mark apiece, with one small condition: you've got to fix them up, and do it right. The likely cost: $7 million or so. Another catch: they aren't in some stunning setting. One, for instance, is in Bautzen, in a region torn up by the old East German Government for coal mining. Then again, if you've got a castle with a dungeon and a VCR (not included), who needs to go out? STOCK MARKET Quick! Get the Pills! This stock market needs a tranquilizer. In the last few weeks, it's been like a manic, seesaw gang fight -- one gang, its nerves shot, itching to sell at the drop of a Greenspan mood; the other, equally jumpy, itching to jump in whenever it sniffs the almighty ''bargains.'' The resulting gyrations have become so commonplace that when the Dow industrials leaped 173 points on Tuesday -- a point gain second only to the surge after the '87 crash -- there was barely a blink.",0.0,0.998,0.998,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

They lose any hope of turning to Bell Atlantic as an alternative to Nynex, which offers its customers some of the worst service in the country. Phone customers in New York State will be doubly hit as a result of state regulatory actions. Under the 1996 telecommunications law, they might eventually be able to turn to AT&T, MCI, Worldcom or other companies that might choose to enter the local phone market. But whether any of those options become possible depends on a series of decisions by the State Public Services Commission. The first, issued last month, appears to make it financially unattractive for Nynex's competitors to enter the local market for residential and small-business customers.",0.0,-0.6285,-0.6285,"            Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

They assigned him a number that struck him as bland and forgettable -- seven digits, none repeating, arranged in a way that implied a lack of order in the universe. He declined. They gave him a choice of two more: one that ended in 2463 -- a stately, even-numbered staircase cut short by an odd 3. No, thanks. The other, 3192 -- a cluster of low roofs with an irksome skyscraper of a 9 sticking up in the middle. No way. For twenty dollars, the phone company offered him three more options, none of which appealed. Sixty dollars and nine more numbers later, he was finally presented with something to his liking -- an elegant descending series: 8765. Sold. In the furor over Manhattan's impending new area code, no one has mentioned that, quite apart from the nuisance of dialing eleven digits to call next door and apart from the social stigma of being branded an arriviste, 646 is a ho-hum number that could be assigned to anywhere, while 212 -- singsong and terse -- perfectly suits the tempo of the city. Like people, some numbers have style, others have none. And, as in people, style in numbers is hard to analyze -- a function of taste. Even so, certain numbers and sequences turn out to be almost unanimously pleasing.",-0.4767,0.8824,0.7999,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

SBC Communications, the parent of Southwestern Bell and Pacific Bell, proposed to take over Southern New England Telecommunications, the local phone company for Connecticut. Then, AT&T proposed to buy Teleport, a New York company that provides local phone service in more than 60 cities. Yet these are modest moves. So far, the 1996 act has spawned more court suits than competition. The SBC merger merely replaces one phone company with another, providing Connecticut no additional choices. But the merger does hold out the possibility that SBC will use Connecticut as a springboard to enter long-distance and local service for residential customers in the Northeast as a whole, thereby giving Bell Atlantic-Nynex a long-awaited run for its customers.",0.0,0.6522,0.6522,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Pro-Government troops appeared to have restored order in Kinshasa, but by all accounts the situation in the interior was far more confused. A1 NATO Approves Kosovo Plan The United States said NATO had approved plans for the use of force in Kosovo, where Serbian forces are carrying out an offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists. The announcement was intended to push Serbia to end the attacks. But no NATO official would discuss what actions in particular would prompt a response. A3 Fears grew about the fate of the tens of thousands of refugees in Kosovo who have been fleeing the Serbian attacks. Long columns of terrified civilians emerged from combat zones, where foreign monitors say homes are being burned and tens of thousands have been displaced. A3 Exile Says He Misled Times A Cuban exile who conducted violent operations against the Cuban Government has asserted that he deliberately misinformed The New York Times when he said in a series of interviews that leaders of the most influential exile organization in the United States, the Cuban-American National Foundation, had provided him with financial support. A7 Leftists Challenge Results A day after elections in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico, the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution challenged preliminary returns that showed its candidate for governor had come in second, saying the balloting was marred by fraud. A8 U.N.-Iraq Talks Breakdown Crucial talks in Baghdad on the remaining issues blocking the lifting of sanctions on Iraq collapsed in rancor, United Nations officials said. The Iraqis rejected a plan proposed by the United Nations chief arms inspector for Iraq, Richard Butler, saying he was using ''old tricks.'' A6 Israel to Release Palestinians Israel was reported to be preparing to free dozens of Palestinian prisoners whose release had been urged by Palestinian negotiators, apparently in an effort to rescue imperiled peace talks. A7 Muslims Attack in India Indian officials said Muslim rebels contesting Indian rule in Kashmir had crossed into a neighboring Indian state and shot to death 34 workers sleeping in two remote construction camps. A6 U.S. Remains Top Arms Dealer The United States remains the world's biggest arms merchant, filling the developing world's arsenals with billions of dollars of weapons, but Russia and France are poised to overtake the United States, a new Government report says. A5 NATIONAL A9-11 Calls for Clinton To Confess Are Rebuffed White House officials said President Clinton, who is to testify on Aug. 17, would continue to say that he had no sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky and was appealing a court decision ordering a top aide, Bruce R. Lindsey, to testify in the case. Several Clinton aides dismissed pleas from Republicans and some former officials that Mr. Clinton acknowledge an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, to blunt or even end the inquiry by the Whitewater independent counsel. A1 House Endorses Campaign Bill A House majority that included 51 Republicans defied the G.O.P. leadership and endorsed a bipartisan measure to overhaul the way the nation's political campaigns are financed, by effectively banning unlimited, unregulated donations to political parties. The 237-to-186 vote made it likely that the measure would prevail against several competing proposals. A1 Plan to Expand Medicaid President Clinton will announce new policies today making it easier for states to provide Medicaid to adults in two-parent families who work at low-wage jobs for more than 100 hours a month. Officials said the changes would help 135,000 to 200,000 people in 20 states. A11 Baby Mix-Up Takes Grim Turn The recent discovery that two baby girls were switched at a hospital maternity ward three years ago took a grim and even more complicated turn with the disclosure that the presumed parents of one baby died on July 4 in a car wreck. A9 MCI Agrees to a Refund An agreement between MCI Communications and the F.C.C. will provide credits to customers who used MCI's discounted ''dialaround'' service, known as 10-10-321, but who got billed at the company's highest rate. The 10-10-321 service is operated through TelecomUSA, an MCI subsidiary. The credits will be provided regardless of whether a person noticed the mistake or complained, the agency said. The commission did not estimate how much money was at stake. Under the agreement, MCI will work with Bell Atlantic to identify which customers were affected, the commission said. A glitch in new switching equipment was blamed for the errors. (Associated Press) NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 Remodeled Sex Business Gets Reprieve From Judge A judge in Manhattan blocked the city's plan to close the sex emporium Show World, saying renovations that its management recently undertook had sufficiently complicated the matter of its compliance with the city's new sex-shop zoning law to require a hearing on Thursday.

The workers began their strike after a day of tense talks between Bell Atlantic and the two unions, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The two sides voiced optimism this morning that they might still be able to reach an agreement today and thus keep the strike very short and the disruption to a minimum.",-0.128,0.2263,0.1027,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Drug company shares rose, but financial stocks were weak, as the Dow industrials gave up 23.17 points, to close at 8,674.85. After rallying late last week, small-company shares faltered, leaving the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks below its level of a week earlier. The index fell 4.16 points, or 1 percent, to 411.64. [Page D8.] Treasury bond yields fell to one-month lows on expectations that Asian financial turmoil would bolster demand at the Treasury's $37 billion quarterly debt sale this week. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 2/32 , or 67.5 cents per $1,000 bond, to 1076/32 , nudging its yield down a basis point to 5.62 percent. [D8.] Wall Street passed a preliminary test of its computer readiness for the year 2000 ''with flying colors,'' the Securities Industry Association said. [D7.] H.M.O.'s Said to Overbill Medicare Health maintenance organizations have been receiving more than $1 billion a year in overpayments from the Medicare trust fund because they bill the Government for administrative costs attributable to their private customers as well as their Medicare patients, Federal investigators said. [A14.] A New State Lure: Wage Rebates The competition among states and even Mexico to attract companies has spawned a new incentive, one strikingly uncharacteristic for a market economy: wage rebates. For example, Whirlpool will get back 4.5 cents of every dollar paid in wages to the 1,100 workers it hired for a stove factory in Tulsa, Okla. [A1.] Ford Cutting Prices for 1999 Ford Motor, for the first time in over 30 years, cut the average price of its 1999 model cars and trucks. The decrease averages three-tenths of 1 percent, or about $61, from comparably equipped 1998 models. The prices of Ford's highest-volume cars, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, will fall by $1,000 to $1,800. [D2.] Oxford Pressed on New York Plan The New York State Insurance Department has asked Oxford Health Plans to increase its reserves for its New York plan by $152 million to insure that it has sufficient funds to pay medical claims over the next year. [B6.] Bell Atlantic Strike Is Felt The strike by Bell Atlantic workers affected customers from Maine to Virginia who were unable to get a telephone line installed or repaired or reach directory assistance. [B1.] China's Firm Stance on the Yuan Asian markets have seesawed as traders play on concerns that China, like the Asian nations roiled by financial crisis, will reduce the value of its currency, the yuan. But China's leaders have repeatedly promised they will not, and the traders overlook the fact that China responds more to politics than to market pressure. News Analysis. [D4.] New Editors for Glamour and Cosmo Ruth Whitney is retiring after more than three decades as editor of Glamour, just 18 months after Helen Gurley Brown left Cosmopolitan. Succeeding the leaders whose sensibilities defined the two women's magazines for a generation are to be Bonnie Fuller, Cosmo editor, at Glamour, and Kate White, editor of Redbook, at Cosmo.

[D5.] The Fortune Rubin Left Behind When Robert E. Rubin left Goldman, Sachs, where he held one of the largest ownership stakes, in late 1992 to join the Government, he may have left a half-billion dollars -- or even $1.5 billion -- on the table. As Treasury Secretary, he earns $99,500 a year. [D7.]",0.0,0.9923,0.9923,"            Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

At least, that's the way it has seemed since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 kicked off the biggest round of changes in the industry since AT&T was divided into eight pieces in 1984. But AT&T can still throw its weight around, as it did in forging the most important communications deal of 1998 - its agreement to acquire Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable company, for $32 billion. And that was in addition to taking over Teleport Communications Group for $11.3 billion, and putting together a $10 billion joint venture with British Telecommunications. The big local phone companies also continued to consolidate: In May, Ameritech agreed to become part of SBC Communications for $56 billion; in July, Ivan Seidenberg, far left, chief executive of Bell Atlantic, and his counterpart at GTE, Charles R. Lee, announced the planned $52 billion merger of their companies. Worldcom Inc.'s 1997 pact to acquire the MCI Communications went through last year, as well, but only after MCI agreed to sell its Internet business to Cable and Wireless of Britain for $1.75 billion.",0.0,0.5714,0.5714,"  Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

Bell Atlantic, the No. 1 local phone company, is negotiating to acquire Airtouch, one of the world's biggest wireless telephone carriers, for around $45 billion in stock, roughly 10 percent more than Airtouch was worth before the talks became public last week. But some Wall Street analysts think that some Airtouch investors would have a hard time going along with what they might perceive as an ungenerous offer.

The previously announced portal site, which was code-named Cyclone and will now be called Snap, is intended to be a free guide and showcase for bandwidth-intensive applications, like video clips and audio files, by making them easier for users to find. ''This is the first shot in the next big battleground in the portal wars,'' said Edmond Sanctis, chief operating officer of Snap L.L.C. As evidence of a growing need for the sort of service he is introducing, Mr. Sanctis said that about 10 of the top 50 search words on Snap have been for some sort of ''rich media'' -- material with animation, video or audio, like the increasingly popular MP3 music format. Though the current market for high-speed Internet applications is small, it is seen by Internet content and access providers alike as an integral part of the on-line industry's future. At the end of last year, roughly 500,000 households had high-speed access, either through cable modems or telephone technology known as asymmetric digital subscriber lines, or A.D.S.L., though NBC said more than 14 million people have broadband access in the workplace. Forrester Research predicts that by the year 2000, two million households in the United States will have faster connections at home. That number could be accelerated, analysts said, by deals like one made in January that provides high-speed connections to America Online subscribers who are Bell Atlantic customers for an additional fee. Along with the official introduction of its new high-speed name, Snap will also announce today 20 alliances with content providers, distributors and advertisers. They include agreements with A & E Networks, the World Wrestling Federation, Tower Records, Pseudo Programs, and Inktomi. In deals with phone service providers like Bell Atlantic Internet Solutions, GTE Internetworking, Cable and Wireless, and 12 others, customized versions of the new guide will be available.",0.5574,0.9705,0.9781,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

In 1954 Mr. Wein started the Newport Jazz Festival, which became the paradigm for outdoor music events. After moving through several different sponsors, it became the JVC festival in 1984. Mr. Dorf put on his first jazz festival (called ''What Is Jazz?'') at the Knitting Factory, his club in lower Manhattan, in 1988, scheduling it to compete with the JVC concerts uptown. A cordial relationship developed, but it broke down in 1997, when Mr. Dorf expanded, found a major sponsor (Texaco), and called his giant festival the New York Jazz Festival. This was the student rather stridently pulling rank on the teacher, and a period of bad blood followed. Jazz is too small for a brand war like this, and detente was probably inevitable. Friendly again, they're both committed to making New York a city overrun with jazz each June, resolving that too much at once is the best way to draw fans to the concerts. This year, Bell Atlantic Jazz (the festival has a new sponsor) runs from June 3 to 13 and JVC Jazz from June 14 to 27.",-0.0258,0.9776,0.9775,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

He is an alto saxophonist whose connection to Charlie Parker is always clear in darting movements and clear articulation, and his greatest departure from the main line of jazz esthetics currently is in the hard, slapping Afro-Cuban drumming that lies behind his work. It's partly an interpretation of Yoruban religious music, the kind that accompanies Candomble and Santeria ceremonies, and it replaces the airy netting of swing and bop rhythm with a kind of beautifully detailed concrete wall. As played by Sean Rickman on a normal drum kit (no congas, no unusual percussion), those layered drumbeats -- at times machinelike and done at brutally fast tempos -- were the sounds that lingered in the mind after leaving the Knitting Factory on Thursday, the first night of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival.",0.0,0.9414,0.9414,"          Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The other band -- the headliners, actually -- will be the New York Art Quartet, a reconvened avant-garde jazz chamber ensemble whose second of two albums was released only in Holland more than 30 years ago, and whose original members -- the trombonist Roswell Rudd, the alto saxophonist John Tchicai, the drummer Milford Graves and the bassist Lewis Worrell -- subsequently fell by the wayside. This is no act of charity by Thurston Moore, Sonic Youth's founder and guitarist, and an ardent devotee of 60's free jazz. The show might be one of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival's hottest tickets even without Sonic Youth as the opening act, such is the anticipation about the reunion of Mr. Rudd and Mr. Tchicai, who have not played together since the New York Art Quartet's breakup in February 1966 and who perform in New York individually only once in a blue moon. They will be joined tonight by the only slightly less elusive Mr. Graves, with Reggie Workman replacing the long-lost Worrell on bass, as he did on ''Mohawk,'' the band's 1965 album for Dutch Fontana, and for its legendary concert that same year in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art. The poet Amiri Baraka will be an added starter with the band tonight, as he was for one track of its self-titled 1964 debut on ESP Disk -- the infamous ''Black Dada Nihilismus,'' with its call for black revolutionaries to rape and murder in the service of liberation.",0.5106,-0.4471,0.0936,"           Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Jazz is patriotism, American genius, our home-grown cultural aristocracy. People who really love jazz routinely misunderstand the scale of its popularity; they wonder why the pride of American culture doesn't have a large audience. One result of this attitude, in the case of New York's two big summer jazz festivals, Bell Atlantic Jazz and JVC Jazz, is that ''jazz'' -- the construct, the marketing word, the mystique -- is too expensive to be supported by the music itself. The jazz needs to be supported by other forms of music that share its audience (a tradition of jazz festivals since the late 1960's) and by nostalgia, which is more problematic. Nostalgia never fails to sell tickets but usually results in lackluster shows.",0.539,0.8279,0.8737,"            Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

But some of the mergers designed to make local phone service better risk constraining what viewers can see on their cable systems, threatening the diversity of information that is central to democracy. A scorecard was needed to keep track of all the recent maneuvers. Bell Atlantic, the largest local phone company, asked the Federal Communications Commission for permission to enter long-distance service, where it would take on AT&T, MCI Worldcom and Sprint, thereby increasing competition. But then MCI Worldcom and Sprint decided to merge, a move that would lessen competition. Meanwhile, the commission approved the merger of SBC Communications and Ameritech, two large regional Bell companies. It also approved rules that will make it easier for AT&T, a huge cable operator, to take over another cable company, Mediaone, putting about 60 percent of American households within reach of AT&T's cable programs.",0.0,0.8779,0.8779,"            Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

One answer was obvious: a sense of the experience of everyday life -- the sights, sounds and sensations that time washes away almost instantly. For the Times Capsule, we set out to document the texture of life today, at least in a single place at a single moment. And so, on Sept. 9, 1999, at 9:09 a.m., a moment chosen strictly for its symmetry, more than a hundred writers, photographers, artists, sound recordists, filmmakers and students fanned out across the five boroughs to document a single minute -- the same minute -- in the life of New York. They came back with a mosaic of 60 ordinary seconds that will, we hope, last a millennium. B - Bronx M - Manhattan Q - Queens B - Brooklyn S - Staten Island M - Stills from a Film by Bennett Miller outside Grand Central Terminal This film and other audiovisual contributions to the New York Minute can be seen and heard in their entireties at www.nytimes.com/nyminute. 339 cars and trucks entered New York City: 12 via the Bayonne Bridge; 18, Goethals Bridge; 147, George Washington Bridge; 38, Holland Tunnel; 85, Lincoln Tunnel; 39, Outerbridge Crossing. Traffic police officers issued 46 parking tickets. M - Michael Schmelling Municipal Building, Chambers Street A kiss is more than just a kiss for Suzanna Remedios and Hormoz Sabet, who have just exchanged wedding vows in a civil service at the marriage bureau. M - Charles Harbutt Fifth Avenue and 13th Street Jamal Rahimi, a vendor from Afghanistan, serves up morning sustenance. M - Merry Alpern West 12th Street Q - Aaron Lee Fineman Rikers Island Badge No. 15053, aka Kelsey Bragg, keeps an eye on a photographer in Cellblock 1B at the city jail's James A. Thomas Center. M - Tony Law Broadway and Houston Street A woman crossing Houston Street was hit by a car. After being administered to by paramedics, she walked away. M - Elisabeth Bumiller City Hall Elisabeth Bumiller, a reporter for The Times, covers Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The mayor's daily 8 a.m. staff meeting, in City Hall's Committee of the Whole Room, first used by Mayor DeWitt Clinton in 1812, is running late, the definition of any mayoral meeting of any century. The morning light coming in through the windows of the Federal-style room illuminates aides seated around a gleaming mahogany table, watching Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani listen to his commissioner of the administration for Children's Services, Nicholas Scoppetta. Scoppetta briefs Giuliani about a rally the mayor will attend for directors of the city's foster-care agencies. When Scoppetta mentions a judge who is expected to be there, the mayor, perhaps aware that his New York minute is not yet riveting, or maybe that he is not yet the central character, makes a move. ''Do I get my money for jury service?'' he breaks in, referring to his service as a juror days earlier in a personal-injury case. Scoppetta, absorbed in his presentation, at first takes no notice. ''And he,'' Scoppetta continues, ''he will bring--'' ''A check?'' offers the mayor, to laughter. ''A check,'' says Scoppetta jovially, catching on, just before the minute is over. M - Chang-rae Lee Le Monde gourmet Deli, 38 West 48th Street Chang-rae Lee is the author, most recently, of ''A Gesture Life,'' a novel. Seung-lae Lee, the proprietor, my cousin, presides over his short-order cooks cracking eggs onto the griddle, two by two. ''Pretty busy this morning,'' he says. And so it is. In this get-to-work rush, the customers line the length of the front counter, each waiting for their breakfast sandwich or bagel to be wrapped in foil and passed over the gleaming glass case. They stand, watching the action, with an uncommon New York patience, for they know it'll be just another minute. Behind the counter, the people-machine is running in high gear, the orders taken and called out, the responses barked back, the talk flying forth in Spanglish and English and Koreanese. Lee's wife is directing it all, shouting, ''Yo, amigo,'' and ''Yes, ma'am,'' and ''Coffee, coffee, ha-rha-buh-gee [grandpa in Korean]?'' her addresses wholly indiscriminate and sweet. Somehow, everyone understands. The two cashier girls ring it up, making change in their heads, their hands moving at the light-speed of a dollar being spent in Manhattan. This is not virtual commerce. Lee knows this, and takes a few overflow orders himself, relaying them to the griddle men, who shout it out, starting the business all over again. ''Not bad today,'' Lee says, surveying his buzzing empire. ''It's working.'' B - Edwidge Danticat Utica Avenue and Avenue D, East Flatbush Edwidge Danticat is the author of ''Breath, Eyes, Memory'' and, most recently, ''The Farming of Bones.'' Gray overcast minute in East Flatbush, a mostly African-American and Caribbean neighborhood. Landmark: Taste the Tropics Ice Cream, its parrot-green awning half covered with a swirling rainbow, linking three palmettos to a giant ice-cream cone. Car horns blare as ''dollar cab'' drivers race to get to the B46 bus stop to scoop up passengers before the bus arrives. For an even dollar each, the elderly caramel-skinned woman in a nursing uniform and the young boy in crisp navy pants, white long-sleeved shirt and a navy Catholic school tie will ride down Utica Avenue in a sleek leather-interior Lincoln Town Car and reach their destinations much faster. The Lincoln darts in and picks them up just in time, before the bus arrives. The co-owner of a new custom-upholstery shop, Austin wishes he could be somewhere else. ''In bed, maybe?'' Or perhaps on one of those trips advertised on yellow cardboard in the window of Astral Travel, across from Taste the Tropics. For $388, one can journey to Trinidad, Grenada or Haiti; a trip to Senegal, on this day of nines, is fittingly priced at $999. M - Susan Minot West Ninth Street Susan Minot is the author of ''Monkeys'' and, most recently, ''Evening.'' In the lobby, a fan is going on the battered desk. No doorman. A sign: ''They are working on the Elevator. Is out of order.'' I step outside. Down the street is the building that served as a model (built in a Hollywood studio) for ''Rear Window,'' Hitchcock's ode to voyeurism. No one this morning looks at one another. A stocky woman in a suit bustles toward the subway, rooting around for something in her bag; an Indian couple walks dreamily arm in arm; a woman with hair still wet holds her chin high. A man in a blue shirt tends his dog. The clock on the brick tower of the library, which used to be a courthouse, says 9:09. Walking toward me with a brisk pace is the shrink I used to see some years ago, someone who has peered in the window of many people's dramas and imbroglios and minutiae, mine included. She walks quickly by, not meeting my eye. 1,022,827 gallons of water and 7,890 megawatts of electricity flowed into New York City. 135,000 phone calls were placed or answered. M - Al Gibson, Mike Panarella and James Mennella 3 Times Square Fifty workers constructing the new Reuters Building on Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets were given disposable cameras to record the minute. Gibson and Panarella are crane operators on the project. Q - Leigh Holtzin the N Train, between Queensboro Plaza, Queens, and Lexington Avenue, Manhattan Q - Jan Staller Queens, construction of a new Water Tunnel M - Marilyn Church 100 Centre Street Judge Carol Edmead of Arraignment Court speaking with Michael Borba, the bridge officer who hands her the arraignments. M - Ken Kerbs New York Stock Exchange M - Grand and Forsyth Streets (left), broadway and wall street (right) Anthropology students from Barnard and Columbia collected garbage that was deposited in trash receptacles during the minute. M - James Traub The United Nations James Traub is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine. Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, left an elevator with his bodyguard and entered a television studio where he was scheduled to tape two messages -- one to ''the world business community,'' the other to employees of Unesco, a U.N. agency. Annan, who had been preoccupied for weeks with the conflict in East Timor, sat down before a mirror to be made up. He was as still as a mannequin, and he wore the muted uniform of the institution man: navy suit, white shirt, red and blue tie. Annan's white hair and goatee made his large, sleepy eyes look impossibly black. When an aide stuck his head through the curtain and said sorrowfully, ''There is a problem with the teleprompter, sir,'' Annan remained expressionless for a moment and then said softly: ''I'll do it another time. Now I can go talk to East Timor.'' B - Nicholas Dawidoff Yankee Stadium Nicholas Dawidoff is the author of ''The Catcher Was a Spy,'' a biography of Moe Berg, and ''In the Country of Country.'' Thomas Fyfe headed for the batter's box at Yankee Stadium. He carried a rake. Fyfe works as a groundskeeper at the most famous baseball field in America, and at 9:09 a.m. he stood alone on the vast green lawn surrounded by 57,746 empty seats, tamping and prodding the muddy clay around home plate. Pausing for a moment, Fyfe looked out across the dew-soaked outfield and noticed things only a groundskeeper sees. In right field, a sea-gull feather lay on a tired stretch of sod that Fyfe refers to as ''O'Neill's spot'' -- a patch of grass the outfielder Paul O'Neill wears down with his vigorous pacing between pitches. An open gate in left-center revealed two tomatoes heavy on the vine in the bullpen garden. In shallow-left, near the stands, were two ballpoint pens, misplaced, Fyfe thought, by fans hoping to receive an autograph. ''Now's the best time in the world,'' he said. ''There's nobody here. You just come out and work.'' M - Cathleen Schine 76th and West End Avenue Cathleen Schine is the author, most recently, of ''The Evolution of Jane.'' In ''The Pursuit of the Millennium,'' the historian Norman Cohn illustrates the five ways in which medieval millennialists identified salvation. 1. It will be collective. We're here, together, waiting for the same thing. . . . 2. It will be realized on this earth. Grinding din of workmen digging up street, heaviness of humidity. . . . 3. It is imminent. Man on cell phone, hand held out with casual certainty. . . . Two women, both in black suits, competitors, eye each other, ready to pounce. . . . 4. It will be total -- utterly transforming life. An undeniable truth in heavy rain. Or when it's freezing and you're not properly dressed. Or when you're late. Like increasingly frantic father with son's backpack. Mother, with squirming daughter, waving wildly. . . . 5. Finally, it will be miraculous. Yes. Only one of blind mystical faith like the man with the cell phone, hand still out, can really expect one now. The others peer irritably into the distance. Lights atop yellow cabs unlighted -- inauspicious. But then. . . . A golden gypsy slows, sparkles beside the believer, blinks its headlights. . . . Just one. . . . The left. . . . It's a sign! It's a taxi. M - Eleanor Randolph Astor Place Eleanor Randolph is a member of the editorial board of The Times. Jerry DeLakas stands alone in his compact green newsstand, surrounded by a panorama of urgent headlines. ''Virus Scare Grows'' shouts Page 1 of The Daily News -- mosquitoes have caused an outbreak of ''encephalitis,'' three deaths in a city of seven million people. Newsday features a postman with bug spray in his mailbag. The stand is oddly quiet. DeLakas smokes, a hazard made worse by his habit of storing his burning cigarette in the middle of a stack of magazines while he makes a sale. Suddenly a man in overalls rushes up, pays for a copy of the Spanish daily El Diario and then begins running back to the street. ''My truck stop there,'' he points to the reason for his urgency. ''No make me get ticket,'' he calls over his shoulder. With 10 seconds left in the minute, a lean man darts into the newsstand, grabs The New York Times, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal and leaves a small wad of bills. Engrossed in his cell phone, he waves off the change, a far bigger deal clearly hanging in the balance. Only once does he slow down -- to explain to me that he cannot stop. A sampling of the books returned to the Brooklyn Public Library in Grand Army Plaza: E.B. White, ''Charlotte's Web''; James Herbert, ''Portent''; David Eddings, ''Sorceress of Darshiva: Book Four of the Malloreon''; Amanda Quick, ''Reckless''; Wanda Ga'g, ''Millions of Cats.'' M - Alex Witchel Grand Central Terminal Alex Witchel reports on style for The Times. Her flowered skirt sways above her ankles, like curtains in a breeze. She makes her way intently around the circular beacon that is the Information Booth in Grand Central Terminal, oblivious to the streams of men charging off the escalators, wielding briefcases big and battered. She walks first past the red schedules, the green, then the blue, selecting one of each -- Westport, Greenwich, Tuckahoe -- as if she were choosing fruit. She passes through the line of harried questioners (''Can you tell me how to go to Metuchen, N.J.?'') and drifts past the man who sets his coffee cup on the shelf holding the schedules, knocking some to the floor, where they lie, ignored. Her journey complete, she files her stack carefully in her black shoulder bag. Knowing now how to get to every New York suburb at every hour of the day, she turns her back and heads toward the subway. B - Charles Siebert Brooklyn Bridge Charles Siebert is the author of the forthcoming ''Angus,'' a memoir of a dying dog. At the top of the Brooklyn anchorage ramp, a well-heeled woman stops to wrestle a homeless man over the trash can he has just spilled onto the promenade, thrashes him with her briefcase, picks up scattered newspapers and puts them back in the container as he canes his way toward the next one. Nearly 10 minutes gone of the official workday, these are the late crossers. No eased faces in the mounting heat, all grimace and climb, traffic so dense you worry for its destination, start counting the city's vertical panes against the passing eyes and windshields here, some incalculable yet daily resolved equation between the onslaught and the eventual settle. The sun slides into view. From unseen roadway scaffoldings below, jackhammers and lug wrench whines, the nuts and bolts, the underpinnings of flight being tended to. M - Joan Liftin Washington Square Park B - Erin Patrice O'Brien Beth Jacob School, Boro Park, Brooklyn M - James Mennella 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue M - Timothy (Speed) Levitch Sixth Avenue and Eighth Street M - Benjamin H. Lee Washington Street, off 14th Street B - Alex Tehrani Third Avenue and 149th street, The Bronx B - Brenda Ann Kenneally Broadway and Kosciuszko Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn M - Amanda Hesser Wall and Water Streets M - Arlene Gottfried Sixth Avenue and 12th Street M - David Shipley Greenwich Avenue and 10th Street B - John Berendt Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn John Berendt is the author of ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.'' Except for the distant drone of a lawn mower and the higher-pitched whapping sound of an edge trimmer somewhere out of sight, all is stillness on this grassy hilltop in New York's ''Garden City of the Dead.'' In the shadow of an imposing bronze statue of Minerva, Charles Higgins, the inventor of India ink, slumbers in a heavy, banklike mausoleum. Some yards behind him, the remains of the musician Leonard Bernstein lie under a simple marker set flush into the ground. Five small stones have been placed on it. Half a million people are buried in this cemetery, and five more are lowered into it every day. They tell me that 135 groundskeepers maintain these 478 lush acres, but all I know is not a single living soul came into view during the minute I stood watch. Esmeralda Santiago Southbound tollbooth plaza, Henry Hudson Bridge Esmeralda Santiago is the author of ''When I Was Puerto Rican'' and, most recently, ''Almost a Woman.'' A Dodge Intrepid cuts in front of a Lexus. The Lexus driver curses and gives the finger to the Intrepid, which then weaves in front of an Eclipse. An Explorer sidles up to a Beetle, hovers next to it until its driver notices, then signals right. A Navigator balks between the Cash Only and E-ZPass lanes, blocking everyone behind. A Pathfinder noses the Navigator, which stops dead in its tracks. A yellow cab takes advantage of the Navigator's hesitation and guns in front of it, followed by a Caravan. An Expedition tries to make the same move, but the Navigator lurches forward, heading, finally, triumphantly, for the E-ZPass. One arrival at Newark International Airport (US Airways Flight 1122, from Pittsburgh) and one departure (Continental Flight 1083, to West Palm Beach, Fla.). One departure at La Guardia (United Airlines Flight 347, to Denver). No arrivals or departures at John F. Kennedy International. B - Harvey Shapiro Brooklyn Promenade Harvey Shapiro is the author, most recently, of ''Selected Poems.'' There they are the water-hugging giants of Manhattan breathing the dun-colored air of morning. Silent, mysterious seen through a white scrim of fog. Directly beneath me, commuter traffic of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Across that, on the Brooklyn docks one lone forklift tractor, loaded with steel rods, jockeying back and forth before the Strober Bros. Building Supply Depot. Across the water, dimly descried, nested in the green arches of Battery, a perky yellow Staten Island Ferry. But the buildings pulsing in their various shades of white and now, as the fog thins slowly, a pale dusty blue, out of Giotto, seems to descend behind them. These mighty presences at the end of Manhattan Island, fronting the East River that is not a river but a tidal strait carrying the North Atlantic to our very doorstep. These monuments that dominate our day as if they had been fixed there forever though they are in flux as the waters are in flux. They stand before us like tribal gods meting out success and unsuccess, all that we have to lift our eyes to. M - Pete Hamill Broadway and Canal Street Pete Hamill, former editor of The Daily News, is the author, most recently, of an illustrated biography of Diego Rivera. At 9:09, the street light changes and trucks roar into life along Canal, crossing Broadway, heading east to the Manhattan Bridge, west to the Holland Tunnel: gru, gru, grug, gu-grug, groooaaaaar. Pedestrians rush across Broadway: two Chinese girls in high heels speaking English; a tan woman with a dragon tattooed on her bare back, sipping coffee as she walks; a fat guy in a Ralph Lauren shirt hurrying across on dainty feet right behind four students with backpacks and baggy jeans. All easing past one another, avoiding collisions, hurrying. A young Latina woman, copper-haired in the morning sun, wearing a tailored tan suit and carrying a briefcase, strides through the jumbled crowd, cutting a path. A large woman in a blue dress pauses to light a cigarette, her face desperate and sweaty, while others move around her. A tiny gray-haired Chinese woman in slacks and blouse, carrying a heavy shopping bag, hurries along, as the light turns to DONT WALK and a Bell Atlantic truck makes an abrupt turn out of Canal, heading directly at her. She freezes in the truck's path. The driver stops, gives her a small wave; she nods and waves back and hurries on, into her American morning. M - Jack Pierson Churchill Park, Bleecker and Downing Streets B - Yvette M. Sohl Central Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn M - Nina Berman Central Park West and 81st Street Madeline Greenberg, in her apartment, gets some help from her nurse, Judy Dennis. B - Angel Franco Viele and Tiffany Avenues, Hunts Point, The South Bronx Roxxanne, a 27-year-old prostitute, in front of the lot where she lives. Originally from Maine, she came to New York 12 years ago. M - Carrie Boretz P.S. 165, West 109th Street Genesis Frias is not at all happy about returning to school. Struggling all the way, she is led into her first day of second grade. M - Julia Topolski West Ninth Street, between Broadway and University Place M - Lewis Lapham The Carlyle Hotel dining room, Madison Avenue at 76th Street Lewis Lapham is the editor of Harper's Magazine and the author, most recently, of ''Lapham's Rules of Influence.'' A high-ceilinged room decorated with the reassuring signs of serious money: English hunting scenes by Fores on walls faced with brown velvet, fresh flowers (Casablanca lilies and curly willow) against a background of old botany (the engravings by Redoute), the pattern of the breakfast china matched to the chintz on the center banquette, the coffee priced at $5, the poached eggs on smoked salmon at $22.50. The 28 tables accommodate a tasteful selection of fine guests, as reassuring as the decor in their dress and appearance: custom-made shirts, German accents, warm suntans lately arrived from Cape Cod and California, a small but important collection of gold jewelry. The two men rising from the table near the door -- Robert Rubin, recently resigned as the secretary of the Treasury, and Richard Holbrooke, newly confirmed as the ambassador to the United Nations -- gather their papers and close their briefcases. They nod to people in remote corners of the room, and as they walk out into the lobby, the matre d'htel bows to them with a grateful smile, acknowledging their fitness to be seen in the company of horses by Fores, watches from Breguet, the lily by Redoute. Frank McCourt 345 East 15th Street Frank McCourt is the author, most recently, of '''Tis.'' It is the first day of the academic year for the High School for Health Professions and Human Services. This is where I used to teach, from 1969 to 1987, back when Stuyvesant High School was in this building. Students crowd the sidewalks between First and Second Avenues. They sit on the steps of the old brownstones opposite their school. They also lean against cars, triggering alarms, which they then imitate. They laugh till security guards or other adults from the school ask them to please stay off the cars. The students are polite, but when the adults go back into the building, they relax against the cars again. Along the street, there are reunions, cries and hugs. Hi, Joey. Hi, Miranda. Wow, you lost weight. Love your hair. The student population seems to be largely African-American, with smaller groups of Hispanics and Asians and an even smaller group of whites. When I taught here, the population was mostly Jewish, though as the years went on it became increasingly Asian. The school bell rings, and the boxes, bags and bottles containing foods and drinks must be disposed of. Adults from the school ask the students to please pick up their garbage and put it in the can, but there is litter and the school year has begun. Zero births and deaths reported in New York City. 7,420,166 estimated population. S - Bastienne Schmidt New Brighton, Staten Island It's breakfast time for Philippe Cheng and his 6-month-old son, Max. M - Garry Trudeau Fifth Avenue and 84th Street The Alignment of The Heavens www.astrology.net B - Deborah Mesa-Pelly Remsen Street, Brooklyn Heights B - Phillip Lopate Carroll Park, Brooklyn Phillip Lopate is the editor of ''The Art of the Essay,'' an annual anthology. Four hefty Italian-American moms sit around the picnic benches, drinking iced espressos while their kids dash around. A father, middle-aged like me (Oh, the sticky solicitous doting of graybeard dads!), tenderly picks up his boy to take him to the bathroom in the dignified stone park house. Another father lifts his tan-frocked daughter up to grab the parallel bars, then says, ''Play with something else,'' and heads for a bench. He's teaching her ''independence,'' meanwhile grabbing a few private moments. She skulks over the standard-issue climbing structure, probably thinking, Why do adults insist on pretending it's fun to play by yourself? This park is the glue that holds our (suddenly trendy) neighborhood together, the one public space that equalizes newcomers and old-timers, haves and have-nots. In their corner, black nannies with white babies discuss in island accents the chances of finding other employment. Across, a woman trains her son to take toddler steps, while absent-mindedly picking lint from her yellow blouse. A huge-bellied man snoozes on a bench, his shopping cart filled with collected bottles. Excerpts from the Dow Jones news ticker, Times Square: TOKYO STOCKS CLOSE 0.2% HIGHER AFTER JAPAN'S G.D.P.

Homes Crunch gym, 404 Lafayette Street A.M. Homes is the author of ''Music for Torching,''a novel. In front of me are hindquarters -- three women on StairMasters, pushing to the top. To my left, a famous foreign correspondent, on a Precor EFX544 Crosstrainer. He reads papers damp with sweat, turning the pages and then shedding them to the floor, leaving a pile of news all around him. On the treadmill next to me, a gray-haired guy, cell phone clipped to his shorts. He runs at 5.8 m.p.h., panting. His phone rings. ''I don't know,'' he barks. ''I don't know anything.'' At the juice bar, someone orders a Chocolate Monkey with soy protein. Overhead hangs a bank of TV's, close-captioned for the hearing impaired. On the exercise channel, a group of 20 does tricep exercises in unison. The CNBC ticker tape flows while Martha Stewart's mother suggests adding pineapple to the rice pudding; Martha, justifiably suspicious, offers that maybe raisins would be more traditional. A commercial for Final Fantasy IV flashes across the screen, and the gray-haired guy is ringing again. ''Are we winning?'' he asks, splashing sweat onto my controls. ''That's all I want to know, are we winning?'' M - Darcy Frey WEST 72nd Street Darcy Frey is the author of ''The Last Shot.'' Location: Small, well-appointed office, decorated with sprawling vines and South American artifacts, in an apartment building. Two men face each other in leather armchairs. On an ottoman between them sits a tape recorder. Patient: Last night, I had all sorts of performance-anxiety dreams. Analyst: Such as? Patient: Well, I dreamt I was in some sort of stage production and I couldn't remember any of my lines. Analyst: Yes? Patient: And the woman I was doing the scene with, she couldn't remember any of her lines, either. [Through the open window comes the squeal of truck brakes.] To be honest, I think it's about my doubts and anxieties about being in therapy. Analyst: Let's stay with the dream for a moment. Where does the dream take place? Patient: I can't remember. Analyst: And the woman -- who was she? [The piercing cry of a car alarm is heard.] Patient: I can't remember. Analyst: Well, what did she look like? Patient: I can't remember. Analyst: Well, was she someone you were romantically involved with? [A jackhammer starts up. Analyst and patient raise their voices.] Patient: No, she was someone I'd been paired with artificially. Analyst: And why do you think this is about therapy? Patient: Well, talk about an artificial situation! M - Michael Pollan Central Park Michael Pollan is a contributing writer for the magazine. ''It's hideous out there,'' warned the radio. ''Hazy, hot and humid'' was the forecast, and by 9:09 it was already all of that. But hideous? Not where I was. Where I was was on the terrace of Belvedere Castle, the rough midpoint and actual high point of Central Park, and the precise spot where New York City's weather is measured by an ensemble of meteorological instruments. At 9:09, the official readings were as follows: temperature, 24 C; dew point, 22 C; relative humidity, 87 percent; visibility, 1 1/2 miles in mist; barometric pressure, 29.87. Here are some other, unofficial readings as of 9:09, collected by five different instruments temporarily installed at the same location: Eyes: Looking north over the Great Lawn, a milky haze hangs in the trees, throwing the blocky crenelations edging the park slightly out of focus. The effect is like standing at the bottom of a large white teacup, the haze curving up the sides to an indistinct rim circling above; only directly overhead is the pale blue of the sky visible. Below, five mallards moving east etch overlapping V's in the green pane of Turtle Pond. Eight turtles nap on a narrow ledge of schist, all presenting themselves to the sun at precisely the same angle. Across the pond, six stagehands are striking the set at the Delacorte Theater. A woman in a Sullivan & Cromwell T-shirt Rollerblades along the perimeter of the Great Lawn, which is being mowed. A belated wisteria bloom, one of summer's (and millennium's) last, hangs in the crown of a cherry tree. Skin: Right cheek registers an intense circle of radiant heat originating at the 2 o'clock position in the eastern sky. Tongue: Tang of salt, from the perspiration beading upper lip. Ears: The drone of traffic across the 79th Street transverse, steady as an air-conditioner until broken by the diesel laboring of a crosstown bus. A jet rising from La Guardia slowly churns the air, then fades, opening a parenthesis for the warble of a bird. Echo-y hammer taps rise from the stagehands, who have switched on a boom box or radio: jazz. Nose: The moist, unmoving air holds each smell in a kind of suspension. There is cut grass; there is decadent pond; there is dumpster; there is hot-dog steam. M - Jhumpa Lahiri Cooper Station Post Office, Fourth Avenue and 11th Street Jhumpa Lahiri is the author of ''Interpreter of Maladies,'' a collection of short stories. A man affixes 33-cent stamps to a pile of purple envelopes. The envelopes are stiff, full of promise, elegantly addressed in bold black strokes. The stamps, self-adhesive, have pink roses on them. The man wears a plaid shirt, khaki shorts, brown shoes and black socks pulled up to his calves. He stands at a table, covered with pale green glass, supported by golden columns. A brass plate runs down the center of the table, with empty round receptacles where there once may have been sponges for moistening stamps. Voices echo in the post office. Heels clip across the floor. The man works solemnly, methodically, about to see a long project to its end. Above his head, a digital clock.Time is running out to the year 2000,'' the clock's backing says: 113 days, 14 hours, 50 minutes, a few seconds to go.

M - Michael Hsu 35 Pell Street John Hung: This is my business, the May May Company, and we're making right now a baked pork bun -- a sweet roll filled with the barbecued pork and oyster gravy. I would imagine 1,000 years from now it'll be automatic, making the dough and getting the fillings ready. Everything will be the same size, same way, identical. Handmade you can tell the difference: some are rounder; some are fatter; some have a little more filling. Anything done by machine has no feeling. Public Radio's Sound Portraits Productions (David Isay, Stacy Abramson and Meagan Howell) sent reporters out to record the minute in eight places around the city. Here are excerpts; more recordings can be heard at www.nytimes.com/nyminute. M - Richard Sandler Jones Diner, 371 Lafayette Street The Rev. Billy, left, sidewalk preacher: A thousand years from now we will not be measuring our lives by our time-distance from the birth of one Jesus Christ. We will be measuring our time from the birth of Mr. Mickey Mouse. Mickey is the most famous corporate logo in the world, and his power over us is accelerating at the present time. We must resist this. How do we do that? Right now we don't have a clear strategy. Right now, Mickey Mouse and his handlers are in the ascendancy. . . . I have a vision . . . of erasing Mickey Mouse's face. Nothing is left of it. Times Square again becomes a place where the sidewalks are populated by real people! Visionaries. Sex workers. Blarney Stone experiencers. People sagging in the doorways. Hallelujah. That's the future! Amen! Praise be! I'm going to get back to my Western omelet right now. Nice to talk to you. M - Beth Fertig Manhattan Criminal Court Mr. Black [he wouldn't give full name]: Nineteen-ninety-nine is the beginning of the end. Everything is getting worse. Anyone selling drugs gets football number -- 55 years, lifetime sentences. Cocaine or weed. I'm here for selling weed, they say. I didn't put a gun to anyone's head. I'm just trying to feed my kids. M - Verlyn Klinkenborg 38th Street and Sixth Avenue Verlyn Klinkenborg writes editorials for The Times. He is the author of ''Making Hay'' and ''The Last Fine Time.'' What does this lot lack that makes it ''vacant''? Tenants larger than the 13 pigeons resting there. Foliage more ornamental than the low weeds growing in a solid mat near the 38th Street sidewalk. Dwellings more substantial than the construction trailer parked beside a sign announcing ''Another Gotham Construction Project.'' Commerce more consequential than the sticker pasted to a fence post advertising a Millennium Marijuana March in May 2000. Will the march take place? Will construction begin? Will the pigeons fly? Nothing happens here except time and the roosting of pigeons. And yet the sound of the street -- an overcast roar -- is subtly changed by the cubic absence, the nearly inaudible silence this vacant lot offers the city.",0.0,0.9994,0.9994,"             Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The announcement, which is expected from the Federal Communications Commission, would allow Bell Atlantic to sell long-distance services to the 6.6 million households it serves in New York State. Approval would mark the first time since the breakup of AT&T 15 years ago that millions of consumers would be able to get both local and long-distance phone services from an AT&T offspring.

The 1996 Telecommunications Act requires that for Bell Atlantic to gain permission to go after the long-distance customers of AT&T and other competitors, it must first open up its own network of wires and switches so that these competitors get a fair shot at wooing Bell Atlantic's customers for local service. Bell Atlantic comes close, but does not pass some key tests. The commission could have held up approval for a couple of months until Bell Atlantic showed it was fully ready. But having already turned aside several previous applications from Bell companies, it responded to pressure to prove the '96 act was creating competition by finally approving one. The danger with compromised standards is that Bell Atlantic could wield its power to wall off its local market even as it moves to crush competitors in long-distance and Internet services.",-0.4767,0.7128,0.5975,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Electro-acoustic improv, as some of it is called, involves one musician playing a noncomputerized instrument (guitar, saxophone, drums, whatever) improvising alongside another ''playing'' a computer or a sampler. There's also plain old electronic improvisation, with a similar search for personal, abstract improvisatory languages. It's not entirely new: electronics and jazz-based improvisers like Steve Lacy were ad-libbing together on stage in the early 1970's projects of Musica Electronica Viva; in the English group AMM, founded in 1965, the guitarist Keith Rowe folded short-wave radio sound into his improvisations.

June is almost upon us, and as usual, jazz clubs, independent concert producers and the big jazz festivals -- there are now three -- are wrangling for the attention of New Yorkers. This means an astonishing bounty for anyone interested in jazz (with Latin music, gospel and soul as connected satellite genres, in the tradition of the big festivals). There's no choice but to see it as one big unofficial citywide festival, the best and most complete in the world. The Vision Festival, now in its fifth year, has been an unexpected success, marshaling various strands of jazz bohemianism into an 11-day series with the air of a community effort much more than of a business venture. The Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, presided over by Michael Dorf, was once a midget slinging pebbles from the cultural margins, but it has become the great enveloper, taking up much of the burden of presenting jazz from all subgenres and ingeniously marketing it on the Internet and its Knitting Factory record label. This year's edition features more outdoor events, many of them gigantic bills and some of them free. (This is a positive development: it will help New Yorkers return to the notion of festivals as something fun that spills all over a public space, rather than self-contained, wallet-chewing affairs.)",0.4588,0.995,0.995,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Families that make few long-distance calls will save the most under the commission's intricate ruling, as much as 50 percent -- a nice touch that brings the benefits of deregulation to low-income families. But buried among the regulatory rulings is something that should prove even more important to most customers in the long run. The commission wrung subsidies out of regulated rates that have kept prices too high and have stymied the outbreak of competition that Congress promised when it passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The issue the commission partially resolved yesterday concerns access charges -- regulated fees that local phone companies like Bell Atlantic are permitted to charge long-distance carriers like AT&T for their use of the wire loops that Bell Atlantic runs into nearly everyone's home and business.

After the spectacular production problems of the Ornette Coleman concert last week -- ending in generator noises, searing lights on the crowd and an aborted show for a pneumatic ticket price -- the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival appeased its audience on Sunday night. It presented an outdoor concert on the beautifully symmetrical, acoustically reasonable south lawn of the Columbia University campus, headlined by Max Roach and Cecil Taylor, that went a long way toward redefining what such events can achieve. At 76 and 71, Mr. Roach and Mr. Taylor oversee their own batteries of phrases, identification marks that run through 50 years of their working lives. They are phrases with flavor, short reports alternating emphatic strong and weak beats. It was the rhythmic parallels of those phrases that brought Mr. Roach and Mr. Taylor together again so effectively in a duet.

They have to be: stage and screen musicals in those days led you firmly through their own paces; inasmuch as they were ambiguous, emotionally or musically, they failed. It takes greater effort to feel the full impact of these songs today. What Mr. Haden is able to bring to them is similar to what jazz singers like Shirley Horn and Jimmy Scott bring to their own repertory: a deliberating sensibility that slows down the songs and punctures their outdated confidence, catching them off guard. Performing on Friday night during the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival at the Angel Orensanz Foundation, with a 15-piece chamber orchestra from the Manhattan School of Music and his own group, Quartet West, Mr. Haden himself broke through the surface a few times. The singer Bill Henderson did, too.

This performance is dedicated to Lester Bowie, the band's trumpeter through three and a half decades, who died late last year. It's hard to picture the band, now down to a woodwinds-bass-drums trio, without Bowie's comic presence, which always balanced out the saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell's formalism. But the band's deep following among the kind of audience that built the Knitting Factory ought to ensure that the evening will at the very least have a poignancy.

Citing a study conducted for AT&T, the company said two-thirds of new customers in New York were not offered a choice of long-distance providers. AT&T said it would seek damages. Bell Atlantic won F.C.C. approval in December to sell long-distance service, and it may already have as many as a million customers, analysts say. AT&T sent a letter to Bell Atlantic in May requesting that the company change its practices or face a formal complaint.",-0.296,-0.6705,-0.7717,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

But beyond that celebrated case, Mr. Klein brought new energy and credibility to a division whose enforcement arm had lain dormant since the Reagan administration. Mr. Klein's tenure did not start well. As acting head of the antitrust division, he approved unconditionally the merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, eliminating the benefits that would come from future competition between these regional phone giants.

534,1390,1390,2000-10-12 01:00:00,U.S. May Pressure Landlords to Allow Digital Competition,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/12/business/us-may-pressure-landlords-to-allow-digital-competition.html,"The Federal Communications Commission is considering issuing new rules today that would take a step toward forcing commercial landlords to open their buildings to almost any communications carrier that wants access to their tenants, according to people close to the commission. As new forms of digital communication have swept the nation and hundreds of companies have emerged to provide them, landlords of apartment buildings and office towers have had an almost inviolable right to determine which companies may set up shop inside their properties. Now that may begin to change. Government officials and industry executives said commission members and their staffs were still battling over the proposals yesterday afternoon and it was possible the F.C.C. could postpone any action. But whether the issue is addressed today or in the near future, the battle lines have been drawn. Consider 450 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, a building near 44th Street that includes the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell, a law firm, and Cline Davis & Mann, an advertising agency. Hines Interests, the building's manager, holds stakes in Broadband Office and Allied Riser Communications, young companies that wire office buildings and offer advanced communications services. Hines has allowed the two to install equipment at 450 Lexington and has yet to give other carriers the same access. Davis Polk and Cline Davis refused to comment, as did Broadband Office. But communications companies that think they are being shut out, as well as some consumer advocates, have not hesitated to attack a system they say is unfair. ''Given the paucity of local communications competition that has emerged since the telecommunications deregulation act of 1996, it's absolutely critical to use every mechanism possible to jump-start greater consumer access to multiple telecommunications providers,'' Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, said yesterday. ''This would be one step forward for breaking down barriers to local competition.'' Others see the matter differently. ''To us, a building is a community,'' said Steve Peterson, a vice president at Hines, a commercial real estate company based in Houston. ''In Texas alone there are 419 registered CLEC's,'' he added, using industry jargon for competitive local exchange carriers. ''Can we have 419 carriers and their equipment in our building? The answer is no.'' ''We're not trying to exclude anybody,'' he said. ''But we want to make sure that all of the carriers are there for the long haul, and yes, we want to maintain a little bit of control over the process. It's our building, after all.'' The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the commission to foster increased competition in local markets, and the F.C.C. chairman, William E. Kennard, a Democrat, has made that a primary goal. But realizing that any attempt to exert direct jurisdiction over landlords would be fraught with political and perhaps legal difficulties, the commission appeared to be leaning toward trying to deal with the controversy indirectly. Rather than regulate landlords, the F.C.C. was considering issuing rules that would prohibit carriers from agreeing to exclusive real estate deals, according to industry executives and people close to the commission. Under the proposal, the carriers, who almost always are subject to regulatory certification, would not be allowed to sign a contract under which they would be the only company allowed to install a network in an office building. In addition, the commission appeared to be leaning toward requiring communications carriers to share their space within office buildings with competitors. To serve business customers who spend thousands of dollars a month on communications services, some companies prefer to install advanced antennas on roofs. Others like to put some sort of switch or router in the basement. Many want to install wiring throughout the building. The landlords control a company's ability to deploy its system. If this fight sounds familiar, it should. In many ways, the debate is just the latest variation of AT&T's battle to retain control over Internet services delivered over its cable system, or, for that matter, the fight over whether America Online must open its instant messaging system to rivals. With some exceptions, landlords have almost the same power in apartment buildings as in office towers. But the issue has become ripe in the business sector because some carriers prefer to install equipment in the buildings of businesses they serve. Such equipment is generally not required to serve residential consumers. The conflict over access to commercial buildings is bubbling over just now because the real estate industry is more involved than ever in the communications business. Landlords are taking financial stakes in new carriers in exchange for giving those carriers the sometimes exclusive right to install equipment. Phone giants like Verizon Communications and SBC Communications, which already have lines into almost all the roughly 750,000 office buildings across the nation, have not been on the front lines of this debate. Those with complaints are generally smaller, newer companies. ''We're seeing an increasing amount of landlords who are interested in choice only to the extent that they have taken a financial interest in a carrier,'' said David S. Turetsky, a senior vice president at Teligent Inc., a new local communications company, and a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department. ''What they all have in common is that none of those models respects the ultimate choice of the tenant.'' Broadband Office was formed by a consortium of real estate companies, together with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm. Joey D. Mooring, a spokesman for Allied Riser, said his company had granted warrants, a form of equity ownership similar to stock options, to some real estate companies that have opened their buildings, but would not be specific. ''Tenants within the buildings should have the ability to choose who their provider is,'' he said. As a business proposition, lobbyists for the real estate industry tend to agree. But as a matter of regulation, they say the government has no right to tell landlords who can and cannot come in. ''This is something that's driven by the tenant market, and tenant choice is the way for people in the real estate industry to be successful,'' said Roger Platt, spokesman for the Real Access Alliance. This group, formed by many of the nation's biggest real estate companies, has lobbied the F.C.C. to back off. ''Building owners are being portrayed as evil characters out of a Dickens novel,'' he said. ''One of the fundamental aspects of being a manager of property is you have the right to both include certain people and to exclude certain individuals. There are narrow constitutional restrictions on that, but otherwise the Constitution is very clear.'' That argument has found some resonance at the F.C.C. At least one commissioner, Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican, has made it clear from the start that the case for forced access is weak at best, said Helgi Walker, a legal adviser to Mr. Furchtgott-Roth. ''Even if such statutory authority were within the discretion of the commission,'' she said, ''the exercise of that discretionary authority would at least raise questions about the constitutionality of its action.'' Taking a page from AT&T's playbook, the Real Access Alliance has suggested voluntary guidelines for preserving competition. In addition to other rules, the commission may make a point of trying to hold the alliance's members to those commitments. Some communications experts suggested that having taken intermediate efforts would be a necessary building block in any future effort to regulate property owners more directly. In the end, however, the companies that have complained appear more interested in getting fast access to buildings than in helping the F.C.C. expand its jurisdiction. ''The point is really to create a process that shortens something that already works,'' said William J. Rouhana Jr., chairman of Winstar Communications, a new local carrier. ''We get access to a lot of buildings, but it takes us an average of nine months to do it. Almost every landlord starts out wondering if they shouldn't consider doing an exclusive, and once that's off the table then the whole process is shortened.''",-0.0772,0.9399,0.9384,"                 Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

After adjustment for seasonal factors, the jobless rate in the city fell to 5.6 percent, from 5.8 percent in August and 6.7 percent a year ago. The rest of the state did not fare as well in September; the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 3.9 percent, which was also the national rate. A year ago, both upstate New York and the nation had jobless rates of 4.2 percent. The end of the communication workers' strike against Verizon caused an unusually big increase in the number of people working in September. But job growth has been strong over the last year, rising by 2.1 percent in the state and 2.5 percent in New York City. Rockland County experienced the fastest pace of job growth in the state, at 2.9 percent; in Buffalo and Niagara Falls, the number of jobs edged up only 0.3 percent.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local phone companies to enter the long-distance market on a state-by-state basis as they convince the F.C.C. that they have opened their local networks in those states. So far, Verizon Communications Inc. has been allowed to offer long distance in New York and SBC in Texas. SBC is known as an aggressive company, and yesterday's application was an aggressive regulatory move. There is less local phone competition in Kansas and Oklahoma than in either New York or Texas, so the commission's approval could set a new and potentially lower bar for the other Bells to clear.

The company has told the state's Public Service Commission that the backlog of requests for new lines and added features like call waiting was whittled down to 6,000 by the end of September and eliminated altogether by Oct. 23. A backlog of thousands of repair orders in the state ''was pretty much overcome by the end of September,'' William Allan, vice president for regulatory affairs for Verizon in New York, said yesterday. The 4,034 customer complaints lodged against Verizon with the New York Public Service Commission during the first nine months of this year are one-third more than during the comparable period last year. Mr. Allan attributed this to the strike and to the ''wet spring and early summer this year,'' saying damage to cables and other equipment is more frequent with extended rain and flooding. Joseph P.

Mr. Suria began by pointing out that in the past four years, debt at a group of seven high-grade telecommunications companies, including AT&T, Verizon and SBC, exploded from $93 billion, to $210 billion, an annualized rate of almost 23 percent. At lesser-quality telecom and media services companies, like Global Crossing, Nextel Communications and PSI Net, high-yield corporate debt and convertible bond issuance ballooned to $275 billion, a compounded annual rate of 60 percent, in the period.",0.3612,-0.4404,-0.1027,"     Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

The small companies that were supposed to have received special treatment to promote competition are complaining that they lost at the expense of giants like AT&T Wireless, Sprint PCS, VoiceStream and Cingular. Verizon Wireless, which refused to form a partnership with a small company, appears likely to pay the highest price.

Across the board, there will be no increases, said Dennis Bone, president of the company, which is based in Newark. In December, Verizon withdrew an application to the State Board of Public Utilities that if approved would have forced most residential callers to accept bundled service packages starting at $15 per month. Verizon did ask the utilities board yesterday to deregulate rates charged to businesses with more than one phone line, asserting that dozens of companies had expressed interest in providing such service and therefore the market was competitive. But Michael Schweder, president of AT&T New Jersey, said that only a handful of companies, including his own, actually provide business phone service in New Jersey, meaning that Verizon could raise rates significantly. Verizon also said yesterday that it would contribute $20 million to provide Internet access to schools and libraries.

The chief sticking point is a requirement that insurers cover contraceptives, a provision that the Roman Catholic Church opposes. The Republican-controlled Senate has said any such bill must exempt religious groups from having to provide birth control services to their employees. The Democrat-controlled Assembly maintains that it will not countenance such an exemption. Fewer than a dozen such committees have been created in the last six years, but this is the first one that has come up empty-handed. Somini Sengupta (NYT) MANHATTAN: STATE OFFICIAL'S DAUGHTER CHARGED -- The daughter of State Comptroller H. Carl McCall was arrested last night and charged with larceny and issuing bad checks, the police said. The woman, Marcella McCall, 37, who lives on the Upper West Side and works for Verizon, was arrested at her workplace at 1095 Avenue of the Americas at 6:20 p.m., the police said. The larceny charge stems from Ms. McCall's using her corporate credit card for nonbusiness purposes, said Sgt. William Stiles, a police spokesman. Mr. McCall, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, would not comment on the arrest.

Verizon had requested the waivers, saying that an 18-day labor strike in August and the backlogs it caused had been responsible for the company's inability to meet the commission's standards for repairs, installations and other activities in those months. Under the commission's regulatory system, penalties, returned to customers as rebates, are imposed if Verizon does not meet various monthly, quarterly and annual performance requirements, though the penalties may be waived when the company shows that the shortfalls resulted from circumstances beyond its control. The commission denied additional waiver requests that Verizon had requested for reasons other than the strike. Verizon's penalties for the regulatory year ended Aug. 31 now total at least $17.6 million, much more than the total in each of the three previous regulatory years. Joseph P.

Clearance For Verizon Long-Distance,https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/17/business/technology-another-fcc-clearance-for-verizon-long-distance.html,"Verizon Communications received approval yesterday from federal regulators to provide long-distance service in Massachusetts, bringing to five the number of states where large Bell local telephone companies can enter into the fast-changing long-distance communications business. The approval by the Federal Communications Commission of Verizon's request in Massachusetts comes after the F.C.C. approved similar petitions in New York, Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma. By next year, analysts expect that the Bell companies, created from the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in the 1980's, could compete with AT&T and other long-distance companies in as many as 20 states.",0.0,0.8834,0.8834,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

The union has said the reports contain inaccuracies and ''direct falsification,'' basing its charge, in part, on complaints that workers phone in on a union hotline. The company has called the charge false and the complaints unsubstantiated. A commission spokesman, David C. Flanagan, said the parties were also to work out procedures to prevent retribution against hotline users. A union research director, Kenneth Peres, said that in ordering the parties to resolve the dispute instead of doing its own investigation, the commission would ''default on its responsibility.'' A Verizon spokesman, Mark Marchand, said the commission's staff had found the company's procedures ''adequate to prevent any significant misreporting.'' Joseph P.

In New Jersey, Blossom A. Peretz, the ratepayer advocate, called on the Board of Public Utilities to reduce Verizon's charges for such access to less than $10 per line a month, from the $16.21 the board set in 1997. That fee was voided last year by a federal judge saying that they have been set in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Bruce Cohen, general counsel for Verizon New Jersey, said yesterday that Ms. Peretz was asking his company to ''subsidize our competitors'' by providing them access ''at a rate below our cost.'' In New York, the attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, urged the Public Service Commission to adopt access-fee cuts recommended by an administrative law judge. Cliff Lee, a Verizon New York spokesman, said his company would respond in a brief that it would submit to the commission. Joseph P.

Verizon is barred from offering long-distance and data services to its local customers unless it can prove that competition exists in the local telephone market. A Verizon spokesman said about one million telephone lines in Pennsylvania -- roughly 14 percent -- were served by competitors. The Federal Communications Commission must rule on the application within 90 days. The F.C.C. has cleared the way for the company to offer long-distance service in New York and Massachusetts.

Verizon and other companies derived from the breakup of AT&T in 1984 are barred from long-distance service until they can show regulators that their local calling markets are open to competition.

But in a 21st century twist, these old spires that were originally built to resemble Christopher Wren's stone steeples in London are becoming the camouflage to hide microwave antennas for cell phone companies. What started slowly just a few years ago is becoming much more common, with church after church in town after town turning over the rooftops to the telephone companies. In return, cash-strapped churches not only receive monthly rent from the companies, but also get their steeples, often in desperate need of repairs, renovated for free. It is a gift many churches just can't pass up. ''We are a very poor church, trying our best to help the people in the community,'' said the Rev. Allison B. Cook of St. James Episcopal Church in Derby, where Verizon Wireless installed an antenna in 1997. ''This was, for us, a gift. And it was going to go somewhere.'' Despite concerns about the health effects of microwave radiation and the queasiness over letting commercial ventures use their space, about 20 churches have cut deals with the phone companies and more are in negotiation.",0.5859,0.9301,0.9452,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

Mr. Ledwidge happens to be an Irish-American splicer who repairs phone lines for Verizon in Midtown. Mr. Ledwidge wrote his first crime novel, ''The Narrowback,'' published in 1999 and reissued in April in paperback by Pocket, while working the night shift as a doorman and freight elevator operator at a luxury apartment building at East 58th Street and Park Avenue. That book, by the way, features a blue-collar Irish-American protagonist and starts off at a luxury Midtown hotel.",0.0,0.5574,0.5574,"       Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

The 1930's, 50's, 60's and 90's were all up for grabs as five first-rate groups appeared during the six-hour concert. The saxophonist Wayne Shorter's quartet was back in New York after a JVC Jazz Festival appearance, and it had been honed by touring in between. Mr. Shorter's 1960's and 70's compositions are revered in modern jazz, and his new quartet revisits those pieces by shattering and reassembling them. Where Mr. Shorter once wrote songful melodies and richly devious harmonies, his new quartet also works with moods, juxtapositions and a rigorous sense of flux.

It said the charge was needed because it had to pay fees to local phone companies, predominantly Verizon, for access to networks to complete in-state long-distance calls. A Verizon spokeswoman, Ivette Mendez, said yesterday that there was no justification for the fee increase because the access fees Verizon charges have gone down. The disagreement is the latest in a dispute between AT&T and Verizon over fees AT&T pays to use Verizon's system. AT&T customers whose long-distance bills are less than $1 will not have to pay the new fee, nor will customers in its program for low-income customers. Joseph P.

On Saturday the dream will come true when Wolfgang Sawallisch leads the ensemble in its inaugural concert in the new $265 million, 2,500-seat Verizon Hall. Designed by Rafael Viñoly, the hall occupies an entire block -- 2.3 acres -- in the heart of Philadelphia. Saturday's concert is to include the world premiere of a piece by Aaron Jay Kernis commissioned for the occasion, and on Sunday comes the official opening, a daylong open house featuring an assortment of free performances. Besides housing the Philadelphia Orchestra, Verizon Hall will be home the Philly Pops, and its 650-seat Perelman Theater will be home to Philadanco, the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society and American Theater Arts for Youth.

Federal officials have been working on a plan to restrict the use of cellular networks to government and emergency personnel in the event of a major disaster, but providers are concerned about the cost and public reaction. Federal officials hoped to have a priority system operating in Washington, New York and Salt Lake City by the end of January, in time for the Winter Olympics.

It is a ritual of appraisal of performance and achievement of goals that is approached with dread -- sometimes by the reviewer, too. Now come these reviews of the review process. Alan Heisey, who now publishes a consumer magazine and a newspaper for the construction industry in Toronto, recalls a manager whose oral evaluation of his work many years ago was more than generous. The evaluation came while Mr. Heisey was a material control supervisor for a television manufacturing factory. He recalls the manager saying, ''If you aren't the best man who ever worked for me, you are one of the best, and I am glad I've got you.'' Mr. Heisey writes, ''That kind of praise has never occurred before or since, but it is memorable, I think, particularly because he fired me a month later.'' ''Annual appraisals for staffers in hundreds of diverse field offices across the country were a huge problem for my company,'' writes George Zucker of Haverford, Pa., remembering his days as a journalist. ''They were still working on it when I retired. ''Our personnel mavens didn't want appraisals heavy on praise and light on red flags. 'We don't become a great company by telling each other how great we are,' was an oft-quoted adage.'' He added: ''The problem was finding credible ways to grade outstanding staffers. Good people expect good reviews and can be overly sensitive to negative feedback. They might quit to find more appreciation elsewhere. ''One year the field managers were ordered to rank each of our staffers numerically. It was a disaster, and the personnel chief was livid when the managers were called to New York the next year for a post-mortem.'' As Mr. Zucker recalls it, the personnel chief ticked off some of the failures of the new system and then looked directly at Mr. Zucker as he said: ''One manager had half his staff ranked in the top 10. How can you do that?'' Mr. Zucker said he replied, ''I had a bunch tied for No. 1.'' There were no rankings after that. ''I am a human resources professional, so you would think that we would treat our own as we preach,'' says Sharon Scheirer, the human resources director at the Equinox Resort in Manchester, Vt. ''One of the positions I held was as a regional manager for a Fortune 500 company. My boss, the vice president for human relations, was located in the Midwest. One day, after my first anniversary, a confidential envelope arrived with my name on it. Surprise! It was my performance review, thanking me for my excellent work during the year. No discussion, no notice that the review was on the way -- just a one-sided appraisal with some dollars attached. ''I now use this example of how not to do it when coaching managers during performance appraisal training.'' ''I have been on both sides of the performance review process, the giver and the receiver,'' writes Joseph Stagnitta of Hyde Park, N.Y., a retired product manager in the world trade division of I.B.M. ''And yes, the task can be dreaded by both parties.'' One time, he said, he was surprised to receive a performance review based on a one-week-old plan ''delinquently submitted by my then current manager.'' ''I challenged the appraisal,'' he added, ''and it was escalated to higher management, which upheld my position that the appraisal was not fair. ''Then, in another instance I had an opportunity to provide the surprise when I declined signing an agreement about my performance review when, in response to my inquiry about what I need to do to improve my rating even further, I was told, 'Walk on water.' ''From that point on, I never rated my company a '1' in the annual opinion surveys, at least not till they showed me how they could walk on water.'' ''As a career changer, I was used to political performance reviews to keep me under the glass ceiling for my age,'' writes Karen S. Kendler, a computer consultant and freelance writer from Riverdale, the Bronx. ''However, one of the worst I ever had was one where my manager forced me to give low priority to technical growth as a career growth objective and then gave me performance feedback indicating I needed to concentrate more on technical growth. ''Damned if you do and damned if you don't.'' Kevin C. Naff of Baltimore, now a manager of business development at Verizon Wireless, knows what to do when he wants a good laugh. He pulls out a review he received seven years ago. While working as an assistant editor for a business trade magazine, he writes, he reported to an editor who was ''one of those types who feels obligated to nit-pick only so she can remind you who's in charge.'' ''She presented my review, which told glowing tales of my superior, flawless performance,'' he recalled. ''Then I turned the page. There, under the section titled 'Needs Improvement,' she wrote: 'Kevin needs to inprove his poofereading skills.'

In recent years, healthy competition has revolutionized the market for many telecommunications products, from long distance to cellphone services. Local service, however, remains a near-monopoly, firmly in the hands of the Baby Bells, including Verizon, that were created by the breakup of AT&T in 1984 and control the ''last mile'' of wire into consumers' homes and offices.

The number of local phone lines dropped for a third quarter as corporate layoffs crimped demand and consumers relied more on mobile phones. Phone lines in service fell 2.1 percent, to 61.6 million.

Seidenberg, the chief executive of Verizon Communications, mused at an investment conference that his company might bid for WorldCom ''for the fun of it'' if the stock price of that long-distance and Internet carrier continued falling. Since then, WorldCom's shares have dropped 80 percent, to $1.58 on Friday. But as Mr. Seidenberg wryly suggested, conditions in the communications sector are so tough that Verizon has no real interest in WorldCom at any price. Verizon, along with rivals like SBC Communications, BellSouth and Deutsche Telekom, all have plenty of their own problems without taking on WorldCom's, which include gigantic debt and an accounting investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",0.2023,0.4954,0.6135,"            Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Then, last winter, after the World Trade Center went down, it was dug up and turned into a hole. Not a little hole. Not a hole with a few flags and two or three workers and a blinking yellow light. The hole that was Murray Street was a crumbling and steaming and wooden-plank-reinforced earthen gash, which, if it weren't lying sideways across the border of TriBeCa and the financial district, would have been about 100 stories tall. In January, on a cold, clear morning, just after the underground version of Murray Street had been opened up, Mike Redes, a project manager for Empire City Subway, a Verizon-owned company that maintains utilities under the street, was standing on a single-family-home-size plot of subterranean real estate in which Murray Street meets Church Street. Over the previous several weeks, the area had been excavated nearly in its entirety, revealing an open stream of cables and conduits, pipes and mains that separated the former World Trade Center from the rest of Manhattan like a moat. As Redes stood there, as he waved his arm and pointed into the man-cut crevasse, men with short shovels were scrambling into the hole, tossing up steaming dirt. ''What the heck am I gonna do?'' he says. ''I've got to put a manhole in!'' (A manhole is a vault that allows technicians to gain access to underground cables without tearing up the street. The entrance is covered by, yes, a manhole cover.)",0.0,0.8972,0.8972,"     Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

Verizon has proposed reducing its work force through voluntary and involuntary measures. But the union, the Communications Workers of America, said such cutbacks would hurt customer service, including lengthening repair time for damaged phone lines. Under the union contract, Verizon must declare a ''surplus'' of workers before layoffs can begin. ''We are claiming that the surplus is not only not real, but that this will do tremendous harm,'' said Gay Semel, a union attorney. John J. Bonomo, a Verizon spokesman, said there was no merit to the lawsuit. Jayson Blair (NYT)",0.0,-0.4588,-0.4588,"           Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

On Monday, the Federal Communications Commission announced that it had approved Verizon's petition to enter the New Jersey market. In May, Verizon said that one of its direct-marketing companies accidentally sent out a mailing urging New Jersey residents to buy its long distance service. But a rival, A T & T Corporation, complained that Verizon had also included long-distance advertisements in Verizon local-service bills sent to more than 500,000 New Jersey customers. Verizon has agreed to send letters to customers informing them that the F.C.C. had not yet approved Verizon's application. If the F.C.C. decides against Verizon, it could impose a hefty fine or even revoke the company's license for New Jersey's $2.2 billion long-distance market.

Luckily, though, they were in St. Clair County, the first county in the nation to install an advanced cellphone-locator system for its emergency service. When the couple called 911, dispatchers pinpointed where they were, and help arrived a few minutes later. This is one of the success stories to emerge since last October, when St. Clair County and Verizon Wireless introduced the first enhanced 911 system for wireless phones. Now any 911 call made in the county by a Verizon customer or someone roaming on Verizon's network can be located to within about 300 feet, and often even closer.",0.0,0.6705,0.6705,"       Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

As part of the ''standstill'' agreement, the second since July 29, Genuity will pay $50 million, according to a statement. The company also said it would no longer finance Integra, a manager of data for corporate Web sites that is 93 percent owned by Genuity. Last month, Verizon Communications chose not to buy a controlling stake in Genuity, causing a default under the company's credit agreement. The new accord gives Genuity time to renegotiate repayment of the loans. Genuity, based in Woburn, Mass., has drawn down $1.87 billion of a $2 billion credit line from banks, as well as a $1.15 billion loan from Verizon, a spokeswoman, Susan Kraus, said.

A supremely confident swinger, he would rather play the genially reverent custodian of the American popular songbook, concentrating on the pleasure to be found in his material. He is so comfortable on the stage that he makes relaxation and rhythmic command appear synonymous. Yet because he relishes abrupt dynamic shifts and stylistic juxtapositions, his singing is full of surprises. A song that begins as a half-whisper can build to a fierce final shout, and jazz riffing can transform into flowery semioperatic flourishes. When Mr. Bennett chooses to zero in on the raw emotion of a ballad, however, the payoff is usually electrifying. During the Duke Ellington segment of his Carnegie Hall concert on Wednesday evening in the Verizon Music Festival, Mr. Bennett introduced ''Mood Indigo'' as his favorite Ellington song and bit into it with a keening vengeance. Pitching it near the top of his upper register, he turned it into a sustained cry of anguish that culminated in a rending melismatic descent on the final word: ''die.''",0.6486,0.9782,0.9842,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

This is what young jazz musicians do these days: it is an effect of having heard all your life the two contradictory, mindless pseudo-truisms that jazz is America's great music of the people and that it can be understood only by a narrow, smug elite. In fact, jazz is a viable art, and much remains to be said in it.

Under federal bankruptcy law, which is aimed at giving troubled companies a chance to reorganize and return to financial health, the government may not revoke a license ''solely because'' the holder has sought protection from its creditors. The federal appeals court here ruled last year that the F.C.C. violated this law by seizing the licenses for which NextWave had promised to pay more than $4 billion. Catching the telecommunications roller coaster at a high point, the commission then reauctioned the licenses to Verizon Wireless and other major companies for $16 billion. But the licenses have never been released because of the legal battle.

At battle's end, 40 to 80 survived.

Ms. Kalla, perhaps the sharpest person covering telecommunications at a brokerage firm today, says Verizon is, at best, a $28 stock.

Verizon is appealing the case, which will determine whether copyright holders can use a shortcut subpoena process to gain access to personal information about Internet subscribers they suspect of illegally copying material online. The company said yesterday that it was asking Judge John Bates to block his order in Federal District Court in Washington until the United States Court of Appeals could review the case. The company argues that the recording industry's view of its rights under copyright law is incorrect and unconstitutional because it would violate the privacy of its subscribers.

''You will see us introduce a push-to-talk product well before the end of the year,'' the company's chief executive, Dennis Strigl, said yesterday at an investor conference in New York. Verizon Wireless joins rivals like Alltel in trying to match the walkie-talkie technology that has made Nextel unique in the mobile phone industry. Investors and analysts have said the popularity of that product among business customers helped Nextel increase sales and add subscribers at a faster pace than competitors last year. Shares of Nextel, the fifth-largest United States mobile phone company by customers, fell 45 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $12.31. Nextel phones include a technology developed by Motorola, the big maker of mobile phones, that lets customers talk to another person or a group of users by pushing a button, rather than dialing a number. Verizon Wireless does not trade publicly. The company is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc., the largest United States local phone company, and the Vodafone Group of Britain, the world's biggest mobile phone company.",0.0,0.9578,0.9578,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Financial terms were not disclosed. EarthLink will be able to sell a fast version of its online service to BellSouth customers in 79 cities, up from about 15 markets, said Rich Wonders, a BellSouth marketing director. That represents 4.5 million more households, the companies said. BellSouth and rivals like Verizon Communications Inc. want to compensate for declines in their calling business by adding customers for Internet access, which they say is as much as 50 times faster than dial-up phone links. The carriers are competing with cable television companies, which also sell fast Web connections. Last week, Verizon said it would make 10 million of its phone lines capable of delivering fast Internet access, after the Federal Communications Commission deregulated installation of equipment.",0.3182,0.9042,0.926,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

SBC's introduction of All Distance Connections follows similar announcements in the last several months by Verizon Communications and BellSouth, according to Aurica Yen, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a market research firm. In the case of SBC, the company is offering its unlimited calling plan for around $50 depending on the state where the consumer lives. The plan is available initially only in California, Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas, SBC said. Shares of SBC fell 47 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $21.68.

We've come a long way since Mr. Cooper's first call, though not quite as far as we need to go before wireless phones fulfill their ultimate promise. High on the list of shortcomings is the fact that customers can't keep their number if they change service providers. If Verizon Wireless or Cingular had been around 30 years ago to sell Mr. Cooper a service plan, he would have had to stick with the company all these years, unless he'd been willing to surrender his number.

Cliff Lee, a company spokesman, said that service was improving, and that the company planned to spend $1 billion in the coming year to install fiber optic cables and make other improvements.

High-speed Internet access has been the fastest-growing sector for most cable companies. The Verizon announcement, on May 2, suggested a possible price war between cable and telecommunications companies, a prospect that troubles many investors.

That future may be at hand, only a few years behind schedule, as a result of the telephone industry's declining economic fortunes, increasing competition and recent technological advances.

The company has struggled for several years behind Mexico's dominant wireless carrier, América Móvil, and faces well-financed competition from Telefónica Móviles of Spain, which is moving aggressively into the Mexican market this year.

In addition to its 1x, 2x and 4x zoom and picture resolutions of 160 by 120 pixels, 320 by 240 pixels and 640 by 480 pixels, the LG VX6000 can take up to five photos in a row without interruption. Other features on the phone include a color screen, Web browsing and e-mail software, a built-in personal organizer and as much as three and a half hours of talk time on a battery charge.

Or maybe the dream has come to you while were you on hold, once again, hoping to resolve the latest billing mix-up caused by Verizon, SBC or whichever local phone company dominates your market. For me, it began when my family moved into a new apartment this year and Verizon informed us that we would need to wait two weeks for a working phone line. Once that service began, we would have to pay about $50 a month even though we wanted to make only local phone calls on the line.

Since 1997, the companies have been arguing over whether their interconnection agreement requires Verizon to pay fees to WorldCom for calls made by Verizon customers to Internet service providers that are customers of WorldCom. As part of the settlement, Verizon also agreed to interconnection rates intended to avoid future litigation or arbitration. ''Approval of the settlement agreement will result in the adoption of amendments to the interconnection agreements that will resolve the uncertainties by establishing a rate regime applicable for a period of three years,'' WorldCom said in a motion filed Friday in Bankruptcy Court in New York. A hearing has been scheduled for Monday, during which Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, who is presiding over the WorldCom bankruptcy, will hear arguments on whether to approve the settlement.

The settlement, approved yesterday by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, ends a six-year-old dispute over whether Verizon must pay when its customers make calls to Internet access providers that use WorldCom's phone lines. Verizon, the nation's largest local-telephone company, also agreed to pay revised interconnection rates to avoid future legal problems. The dispute ''is possibly the largest collective piece of litigation'' at WorldCom and ''resolving it is very key in all of the processes,'' Alfredo Perez, WorldCom's bankruptcy lawyer, told Judge Gonzalez. In July 2002 WorldCom filed the biggest bankruptcy case in United States history in terms of declared asset value. The company, based in Ashburn, Va., expects to complete its reorganization and come out of bankruptcy early next year as MCI, the name of its best-known unit.

The companies agreed to initial terms of a contract and expect to sign a five-year agreement on converting Verizon's network with new packet switches and other Web-calling gear in the next few months, they said. A Verizon spokesman, Mark Marchand, would not say how much the contract was worth. Nortel expects to report a profit for 2003 after net losses of more than $35 billion in the preceding five years. Nortel is winning orders as carriers upgrade networks with packet-switching technology, which compresses voice and data traffic so it can be sent together over high-speed lines. Shares of Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, rose 92 cents, to $5.68. The shares are down from a high of $89 in July 2000. Verizon shares rose 8 cents, to $36.56.",0.296,0.9485,0.9571,"       Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

Volunteers and staff members of the group spent four months surveying 100 stations picked at random from the 712 stations in the system. About 27 percent of subway pay phones surveyed did not work, compared with 17 percent of Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad pay phones, the survey said. The most common problems were no dial tone on the phone (38 percent); failure to return a coin (24 percent); coin not registering (13 percent); coin slot blocked (11 percent); inability to connect a call (10 percent); and flawed handset (5 percent). A Verizon spokesman, Daniel Diaz Zapata, said that the problems stemmed from vandalism and the difficulty of tracking the phones' condition. He urged riders to dial *55 from a working phone to report a problem. Michael Luo (NYT)",0.0,-0.9664,-0.9664,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

A computer-science major at California State University, Los Angeles -- he entered at age 13 -- Josh already had a cellphone included in his father's Verizon Wireless account.

Verizon said that it would lease its lines in customized three-year deals to competitors. Verizon, which operates in 30 states, said the price would vary by state but would typically range from $20 to $24 per telephone line a month, with the cost rising each subsequent year. The offer from Verizon follows similar proposals by other regional telephone giants, like SBC and BellSouth. Generally, the offers come after a recent appeals court decision that threw out federal rules forcing the dominant local phone companies, like Verizon, to lease their networks to competitors at low rates set by state regulators.

But the new rule, which became effective last November, has increased competition among carriers. John B. Muleta, chief of the commission's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, said more than two million numbers had been transferred since last November, far fewer than the 12 million some industry analysts had predicted. The rule has caused a shift in market share among carriers, Mr. Muleta said, without providing specifics. Company reports show AT&T Wireless had the most defections by customers in the first quarter, while Verizon Wireless had the fewest. Number portability has only been available in the 100 largest markets since November. On May 24, number portability will become available in the rest of the country.

A group of 19 telephone service providers had hoped to present federal regulators with a plan that would eliminate the fees the companies pay each other but raise consumers' line charges. Company officials worry that consumers would see the jump in line charges and not realize that they are paying less for long-distance and local calls. They are also concerned that the plan would be impossible to enact when voters are already upset about the rising cost of consumer goods.,0.0,-0.8834,-0.8834,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

NextWave agreed last month to return most of its spectrum licenses to the Federal Communications Commission and either give back other airwave rights or pay $386 million out of proceeds from their sale. The accord, approved by Judge Adlai S. Hardin Jr. of Federal Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, gives mobile carriers like Verizon Wireless another opportunity to buy the licenses. ''I have been before you a lot of times in the past six years and there have been a lot of twists and turns in this case,'' a NextWave lawyer, Deborah Schrier-Rape, told Judge Hardin. ''We are here to end the problem that has governed NextWave for the past six years.'' The legal battle between NextWave and the commission culminated in a United States Supreme Court decision last year that allowed NextWave to keep the spectrum that the government reclaimed in 2000. NextWave owed the commission $4.3 billion out of $4.8 billion for the licenses won in auctions in 1996 and 1997 and the debt remained an obstacle to its successful reorganization. The company expects to submit a reorganization plan by July, said Michael Wack, a NextWave lawyer and spokesman.",0.4215,0.9531,0.9638,"           Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

Verizon Wireless, the country's biggest cellphone provider, is already upgrading its network using EV-DO technology. Separately, Cingular Wireless said it would accept bids from telecommunications equipment makers for a high-speed data network using U.M.T.S., or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, technology. EV-DO and U.M.T.S. let cellphone users download video, music, e-mail and other data at speeds 40 times or more faster than current cellphone connections.

In the cellphone world, the sixth-largest carrier, Nextel Communications, is the one to watch. Nextel's rapidly improving business has defied skeptics, who have long seen the company as a scrappy, but distant, contender. Created in 1987 when its predecessor, Fleet Call, started buying spectrum licenses used by radio dispatchers, the company teetered financially for years. It has few ties to telephone giants like Verizon and AT&T.

Berson recently closed on a major office building in the north end of Newark's business district, paying $26.5 million for the 17-story 400,000-square-foot structure. It was an unlikely investment, since the building has sat almost vacant since its principal tenant, Verizon, pulled out about a year ago, and the city's office vacancy rate hovers around 15 percent. But Mr. Berson thinks Newark is on the verge of a major revival -- one that has been talked about for a long time, but which has been very slow in happening. Now, however, several development and infrastructure projects are under way or in advanced planning that could capitalize on Newark's excellent transportation links to bring a new generation of people to live and work in the city.",0.4847,0.8201,0.8632,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

Responding in part to Sprint, which cut a similar fee to 25 cents from 40 cents, Verizon, the nation's second-largest mobile phone carrier, will forgo $15 million a month.

In considering offers during a two-month bidding war, the board decided that the current dollar value of the deals was just one consideration. The directors also tried to determine what the deals would be worth a year from now, when regulators are likely to sign off.

In March, Robert J. Alexander and his team at CB Richard Ellis arranged the $505 million sale of Verizon's headquarters, on the Avenue of the Americas near 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan, to Equity Office Properties Trust, the nation's largest office real estate investment trust. At the same time, as part of Verizon's consolidation efforts, he helped the company buy the old AT&T headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., for $100 million. Next, Equity Office hired him and his team to act as leasing agent for the former Verizon headquarters, with 1.1 million square feet of space. But the trifecta, which stands to generate millions in commissions for CB Richard Ellis, is merely the latest coup for Mr. Alexander, 50, whose heavy-hitter status and physical stature -- he is 6-foot-2 and still has the shoulders of the high school defensive end he once was -- have earned him the nickname Mr. Big.",0.0,0.7717,0.7717,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

September 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' The New York City Opera is already in session, having last week presented new productions of Strauss's ''Capriccio'' and Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Patience,'' and a revival of Mark Lamos's acclaimed production of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' repeated today. These and another revival, of Rossini's ''Viaggio a Reims'' on Sept. 22, will carry the company through to its next new production, of Dukas's ''Ariane et Barbe-Bleu'' on Oct. 6. Continues today. New York State Theater. CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER The cellist David Finckel and the pianist Wu Han, a husband-and-wife team announced last year as music directors of the society, finally make their presence felt in performance, with the pianist Emanuel Ax, the percussionist Don Liuzzi and others. Thursday. Alice Tully Hall. LOUISIANA PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA The only thing that seems clear is that the orchestra will not open its season on this, its scheduled date. Here's hoping that it can get up and running before the season is out. Thursday. Orpheum Theater, New Orleans, (504)523-6530. www.lpomusic.org BACH CHORAL WORKSHOP Once again, Carnegie Hall jumps the gun on its official opening in the main auditorium with a professional training workshop, this one led by the Dutch Bach specialist Ton Koopman. A week's activities involving 24 singers and a chamber orchestra culminate in a concert of cantatas. Sept. 19. Zankel Hall. METROPOLITAN OPERA The big drama at the Met this season promises to take place behind the scenes. The plot has Joseph Volpe, the imperious and irascible general manager, grooming his successor, the ambitious and often testy Peter Gelb, recently of Sony Classical records -- and this at a time when finances and audiences are slumping. If the two get through it alive, Mr. Gelb will undoubtedly be as thrilled as Mr. Volpe when the season ends with a Volpe farewell gala, on May 20. Here, meanwhile, is the season-opening gala, with Isabel Bayrakdarian, Susan Graham and Bryn Terfel in Act I of Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' Angela Gheorghiu and Mr. Terfel in Act II of Puccini's ''Tosca'' and Denyce Graves and Plácido Domingo in Act III of Saint-Saëns's ''Samson et Dalila.'' James Levine, not yet in complete thrall to the Boston Symphony, conducts. Sept. 19. Metropolitan Opera House. NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Whatever surprises or challenges the orchestra's season may hold (like a timid ''focus'' on Elliott Carter, consisting of four works) are not apparent in the first week, which presents two programs conducted by Lorin Maazel, both built on the same model. On opening night, Evgeny Kissin plays Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto, and Mr. Maazel conducts Strauss's ''Don Juan'' and a ''Rosenkavalier'' Suite. In the subscription concerts that follow, Lang Lang plays Chopin's First Piano Concerto, and Mr. Maazel conducts Mahler's First Symphony. Sept. 21-24, 27. Avery Fisher Hall. ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA It has been a long courtship -- long enough that the orchestra got into a scrape with management last year, in a bitter lockout (or strike or whatever), and that its new music director, David Robertson, has been bruited for positions in Chicago and elsewhere even before officially taking over this orchestra. It finally happens, in a bracing program including Claude Vivier's ''Lonely Child'' and John Adams's ''Harmonielehre.'' Sept. 23-25. Powell Symphony Hall, (314)534-1700. www.slso.org GYORGY LIGETI A composer portrait. Sept. 28, 30; Oct. 1, 29; Nov. 12 . Miller Theater. A related article is on Page 87. LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA From his new perch at Carnegie Hall, the orchestra's former manager Clive Gillinson watches as his onetime charges make their annual visit to Lincoln Center. The orchestra has in recent years provided, perhaps too readily, a forum for its venerable music director, Colin Davis, to indulge old specialties anew, but the results are often compelling. The golden oldies here are Verdi's Requiem, Sibelius's ''Pohjola's Daughter'' and ''Kullervo,'' and Vaughan Williams's Sixth Symphony and Walton's First. Look not so much for blazing revelations as for the comforts of accumulated wisdom and the mellowness of age and familiarity. Sept 28, 30; Oct. 2. Avery Fisher Hall. NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Neeme Jarvi begins his tenure as the orchestra's music director with a surprise er, ''Surprise'': Haydn's Symphony No. 94. But any hint of real adventure -- and there are a few this season -- will have to await future programs, as Saint-Saëns's Piano Concerto No.2 (with the excellent Marc-André Hamelin as soloist) and Rachmaninoff's ''Symphonic Dances'' fill out the program. Sept. 29-30; Oct. 2. Halls in New Brunswick, Trenton and Newark, (800)255-3476. www.njsymphony.org ST. PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Yuri Temirkanov and the orchestra generally come to New York bearing big Russian masterworks, and the first concert, opening the Carnegie Hall season, runs true to form with Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto (played by Yefim Bronfman) and Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony. But the other two programs are surprisingly cosmopolitan, with works by Weber, Brahms, Dvorak and Sibelius. No matter, there is plenty of scope for Mr. Temirkanov to display his inimitable command of the long line. Sept. 29-Oct. 1. Carnegie Hall. NEW YORK COLLEGIUM The ensemble opens its eighth season sonorously and antiphonally, with music of Giovanni Gabrieli from Venice at the turn of the 17th century. The program, conducted by Andrew Parrott, includes motets, canzonas, sonatas and a 17-voice Magnificat. Sept. 30. St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212)717-9246. www.nycollegium.org ARVO PÄRT If you need a reason to rejoice on Sept. 11, it is Mr. Pärt's 70th birthday. The record labels have already begun to celebrate -- if you can call a recording named ''Lamentate'' (the Hilliard Ensemble, from ECM New Series) a celebration. Harmonia Mundi France has released a tribute album, with performances led by Paul Hillier. And now comes a DVD, ''24 Preludes for a Fugue,'' a documentary about Mr. Pärt and his music. It should be fascinating to see how far the filmmakers could burrow into his hermetic existence. September. Naxos/Idéale Audience. October 'DOCTOR ATOMIC' A new opera, composed by John Adams and directed by Peter Sellars. Opens Oct. 1. San Francisco Opera, War Memorial Opera House, (415)864-3330. www.sfopera.com. A related article is on Page 89. 'ORION' In assembling this big work, commissioned for the Athens Olympics in 2004, Philip Glass seems to have been as much impresario as composer, bringing together longtime collaborators from around the world. This performance includes Mark Atkins on didgeridoo, Wu Man on pipa, Ashley MacIsaac on fiddle and others. ''We Are the World'' with a punch, perhaps, and a powerful one, according to some who have experienced it. Oct. 4, 6-8. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, (718)636-4100. www.bam.org 'ORPHEUS AND EURIDICE' As part of the New Visions series at Lincoln Center, a new song cycle by the versatile Ricky Ian Gordon is presented in a staging by Doug Varone. The soprano Elizabeth Futral is joined by the clarinetist Todd Palmer. Oct. 5, 7-8. Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)721-6500. www.lincolncenter.org 'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEU' Leon Botstein is more widely valued as a champion of obscure repertory than as a conductor per se. And in fact, he presented this little-known opera by Paul Dukas in concert with the American Symphony Orchestra in 1999. So it is fitting that he makes his conducting debut at the New York City Opera with it. Carol Vaness was to have made a triumphant return to the company in the demanding title role but canceled because of an injury. Renate Behle replaces her. Opens Oct. 6. New York State Theater. VIRGIL FOX LEGACY With a variety of organists on hand, performances and discussions honor the memory of the ultimate switched-on master of the instrument on the 25th anniversary of his death. Don't expect the obsequies to be subdued. Oct. 7-10. Various churches in Manhattan, (212)799-9300; (800)486-6628. www.LegacyConcerts.com 'TROUBLE IN TAHITI' Caramoor, the home of a popular summer music festival, is expanding its activities during the concert season. Here Michael Barrett conducts members of Caramoor's Bel Canto Soloist program in Bernstein's witty little opera. (Bernstein later wrote a less witty companion piece, ''A Quiet Place,'' whose absence is no great loss.) Oct. 8. Caramoor, Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1492. www.caramoor.org BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA You can almost see the fun that James Levine is having, planning entire orchestral seasons. At the Metropolitan Opera, it is, say, ''Don Giovanni'' or ''Fidelio,'' ''Don Carlo'' or ''Tristan und Isolde,'' ''Wozzeck'' or ''Moses und Aron.'' Those are wonderful choices, but they are limiting, night after night, year after year. This well-stuffed program is a prime example of a fertile imagination at play: Elliott Carter's ''Three Illusions,'' in its New York premiere; Lukas Foss's masterwork ''Time Cycle,'' with Dawn Upshaw as vocalist; Ives's ''Three Places in New England''; and Gershwin's Piano Concerto in F, with Jean-Yves Thibaudet as soloist. Oct. 10. Carnegie Hall. JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA The Juilliard School celebrates its centenary with special events throughout the season, but this is the official anniversary concert. Dennis Russell Davies conducts Webern's Six Pieces (Op. 6) and Schubert's Ninth Symphony as well as a work commissioned for the occasion, Einojuhani Rautavaara's ''Manhattan Trilogy.'' Oct. 11. Carnegie Hall. MARIN ALSOP Ms. Alsop was already drawing wide attention before her recent fracas with the players of the Baltimore Symphony over her appointment as music director in 2007. And surprisingly, given that her reputation has been as a champion of unfamiliar repertory, that attention was for a recording of Brahms's First Symphony with the London Philharmonic Orchestra on Naxos, the first in a complete CD cycle of the Brahms symphonies. Here she conducts that First at the New York Philharmonic, along with works by Prokofiev and James MacMillan. Oct. 14-15, 18. Avery Fisher Hall. BEAUX-ARTS TRIO The group has just turned 50, at least in the person of its founding pianist, Menahem Pressler. It is in its scond of three seasons surveying all the piano trios, violin sonatas and cello sonatas of Beethoven. Oct. 14; Dec. 2; April 21. Metropolitan Museum. APRILE MILLO This soprano, who went from quick stardom at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere to lower-profile engagements and cult status, is evidently making a new bid for stardom. She was acclaimed as Tosca at the Met last season, and now she makes her recital debut at Carnegie Hall, with the pianist Ken Noda. The repertory will range from Puccini, Verdi and Donizetti to Brahms and Mahler. Oct. 14. Carnegie Hall. In addition, Ms. Millo will sing the title role in Leoncavallo's ''Zazà'' in a concert performance by Teatro Grattacielo. Nov. 12. Alice Tully Hall. CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA An adversarial press is hardly new to the conductor Franz Welser-Möst, after his rude baptism at the London Philharmonic a decade and more ago. Now he finds himself embattled in Cleveland with Donald Rosenberg, the chief critic of The Plain Dealer. The root complaint seems to be that Mr. Welser-Möst is no Christoph von Dohnanyi, his predecessor. Granted. Mr. Welser-Möst is his own man. And some of us -- having heard at least as many brilliant moments as lesser ones from him, especially in Brahms -- would like to know that man better. Here, at any rate, is more Brahms, the First Symphony and the ''Academic Festival Overture,'' as well as the New York premiere of Chen Yi's ''Four Seasons.'' Oct. 17. Carnegie Hall. CECILIA BARTOLI The program this adventuresome musical sleuth sings here -- as yet unidentified music by Alessandro Scarlatti, Caldara and Handel -- presumably duplicates in large part her new Decca recording, ''Opera Proibita.'' In the first decade of the 18th century, when opera and other theatrical works were banned in Rome by the pope, composers wrote underground, for private performances, or resorted to subterfuge, writing operatic works masquerading as oratorios and the like. For obvious reasons, much of this music has been slow to come to light, and Ms. Bartoli's album is said to include premiere recordings. If anyone can turn these pieces into instant classics, it is Ms. Bartoli. Oct. 19. Carnegie Hall. NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG The festival opens its 18th season with ''Since the 70's: A Generation of Song,'' featuring works by the likes of William Bolcom, John Musto, John Corigliano and Ricky Ian Gordon. Oct. 19. Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330. www.nyfos.org CHRISTOPHER MALTMAN He ''may have the world's most perfect baritone voice at the moment,'' The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote after Mr. Maltman performed in Brahms's ''German Requiem'' with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Although you try to maintain a certain critical skepticism, claims like that catch your attention, especially when they are seconded by reports from trusted acquaintances. Here is a chance to judge for yourself, as Mr. Maltman performs a wildly varied song recital, with Malcolm Martineau as pianist. Oct. 20. Zankel Hall. BARD MUSIC FESTIVAL After two hectic festival weekends in August, there is, evidently, still something to say about Copland and his world. Just ask Leon Botstein. (No, you won't even have to ask.) Oct. 21-23. Fisher Center, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900. www.bard.edu/bmf 'PIANO FORTE' The Met Museum has been presenting ever more impressive series of piano recitals in recent years, paying particular attention to young competition winners. This new season-long series presents some of those but also includes established veterans. The organization is based on juxtapositions of repertory. Sergey Schepkin leads off here with a program of Bach and Brahms. Fazil Say and Frederic Chiu chime in later with more Bach and Brahms. Antti Siirala, Stephen Kovacevich, John O'Conor and Martin Kasik play Beethoven and Schubert. Marc Laforêt and Alexei Grynyuk play Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Begins Oct. 22. Metropolitan Museum. ROYAL STOCKHOLM PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA It is undoubtedly a fine orchestra, but much of the attention here will be focused on its music director, Alan Gilbert, a youngish American of whom big things are expected. The first program is unusual: an extended set of Scandinavian vocal works, sung by Anne Sofie von Otter, followed by Mahler's Fifth Symphony. The second, apart from the New York premiere of Anders Hillborg's ''Exquisite Corpse,'' is more standard: Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, played by Lars Vogt, and Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony. Oct. 22-23. Carnegie Hall. 'THE MINES OF SULPHUR' There are works that you know exist, for one reason or another, yet never get a chance to hear (unless the conductor Leon Botstein lives in your neighborhood). And then there are works that seem to come out of nowhere, like this 40-year-old opera by Richard Rodney Bennett. The production comes from the Glimmerglass Opera, where it was the surprise hit of last summer, and Glimmerglass forces have already recorded the work for Chandos. David Schweizer directs, and George Manahan conducts. Opens Oct 23. New York State Theater. ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S A new Telarc recording of Mozart's Requiem, conducted by Donald Runnicles, has been acclaimed as much for Robert Levin's inspired completion of that unfinished work as for the typically splendid work of the Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus. Here Mr. Runnicles imports that choir to steal a march on the Mozart year, with the stirring Requiem and the ineffable ''Ave Verum Corpus.'' Oct. 27. Carnegie Hall. SHOSTAKOVICH CENTENNIAL In any major Shostakovich celebration, you can trust that the symphonies and the string quartets will be tended to, as they are this season by Great Performers at Lincoln Center. But there are still vast tracts of repertory lying fallow. Here the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center cultivates one of those tracts, the chamber repertory, but studiously leaves the string quartets to others. Good forethought. Oct. 28, 30; Nov. 1. Alice Tully Hall. BACH CHOIR OF NEW YORK The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, having found a new conductorless playmate, performs for the first time with chorus. The estimable Kent Tritle, the innovative and tireless music director at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue, is the choir's artistic and music director. It joins Orpheus in Bach's Magnificat as part of the band's Carnegie Hall concert on Dec. 3. But the groups also combine in two full programs of Bach cantatas in the Met's Medieval Sculpture Hall. Oct. 31; March 13. Metropolitan Museum. 'MESSIAH' If you're going to have yet another recording of Handel's perennial, it may as well be one to provoke thought or visceral reaction. And the more standard the work, the more you can count on Nikolaus Harnoncourt to tee you off at some point. It should be revealing to see how Mr. Harnoncourt's views on the work may have changed since he recorded it 20 years ago, given his various adventures inside and outside the early-music world since. A strong vocal cast (Christine Schäfer, Anna Larson, Michael Schade and Gerald Finley) joins the Arnold Schoenberg Choir and the Concentus Musicus Wien. October. Deutsche Harmonia Mundi. November CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In his last season as the orchestra's music director, Daniel Barenboim comes calling to New York with three programs centering on big symphonies: Bruckner's Fifth, Schubert's Ninth and Mahler's Fifth. The rest is Schoenberg, Elliott Carter and the inevitable (this season) Mozart. Nov. 3-5. Carnegie Hall. GIDON KREMER Mr. Kremer is a violinist of consummate refinement and technique. If you have any doubt, watch for his new recording of Bach's unaccompanied sonatas and partitas, to be released by ECM New Series next month. (Having heard Mr. Kremer perform the works in concert three years ago, I will recommend the recording, sound unheard.) But Mr. Kremer's service to music has gone far beyond his brilliant fiddling, particularly in spreading the good word about a number of East European composers. Alfred Schnittke was one of his early causes and continues to be a favorite. Here Mr. Kremer presents the New York Philharmonic premiere of Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No. 5. Mikko Franck conducts, and Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony fills out the program. Nov. 3-5. Avery Fisher Hall. ANGELA HEWITT Ms. Hewitt is an admirable Bach pianist, deft, graceful and outgoing, though she is not always entirely riveting. Here she plays the first book of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier,'' and it will be fascinating to see how well she conveys the interiority, intensity and concentration of these pieces. Nov. 5. Miller Theater. McDUFFIE DUTTON KIRSHBAUM TRIO The literature for string trio is not so rich that there are many permanent ensembles. But this ad hoc group of solo-caliber players -- the violinist Robert McDuffie; the violist Lawrence Dutton, of the Emerson String Quartet; and the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum -- should do just fine in works by Mozart, Beethoven and Dohnanyi. Nov. 5. 92nd Street Y. 'CHANT WARS' We tend to think that what has come down to us as Gregorian chant is a simple, monolithic and changeless body of music. Nothing of the kind. The men's contingents of two respected early-music groups, Sequentia and Dialogos, square off to dramatize the formative ninth-century conflict between the cantors of Charlemagne and those of the pope. It is a program the groups have been honing for several years, and a recording of it is to be released by Deutsche Harmonia Mundi in October. I'm not sure who plays whom, but my money is on Sequentia (maybe only because I haven't heard Dialogos). Nov. 6. Metropolitan Museum. 'THE LITTLE PRINCE' At the New York City Opera, Rachel Portman's opera about well, you know. The production is by Francesca Zambello, with sets and costumes by Maria Bjornson. Opens Nov 12. New York State Theater. ENGLISH CONCERT This once pioneering period-instrument group has been re-energized by the firebrand violinist Andrew Manze, as it shows once again in its new recording of Heinrich Biber's Missa Christi Resurgentis on Harmonia Mundi France. Biber seems to be a particular passion of Mr. Manze, who in this concert sandwiches Biber works between his own reconstructions of ''original'' versions of two of Bach's orchestral suites. Nov. 14. Zankel Hall. 'ROMÉO ET JULIETTE' Two years ago, as she was emerging from a vexing period of vocal troubles, Natalie Dessay spoke tentatively about expanding her repertory to include this Gounod opera, pending her successful return to the Met as Zerbinetta in Strauss's ''Ariadne aux Naxos.'' The deal must already have been in the works for this new production, and fortunately, Ms. Dessay's intervening fortunes have done nothing to scotch it. Ramón Vargas is a practiced Roméo, and Guy Joosten directs. Opens Nov. 14. Metropolitan Opera House. PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA So, in the wake of the Marin Alsop flap at the Baltimore Symphony, how much does it matter if an orchestra and its music director do not madly love each other? Philadelphia appears to be a test case at the moment. Several players were vocal in their opposition to the hiring of Christoph Eschenbach four years ago, and many a discouraging word is still heard. In any case, the Eschenbach-Philadelphia chemistry has not set the world on fire -- or even the American Northeast, preoccupied as it is with James Levine and the Boston Symphony. Mahler's gloomy and portentous Sixth Symphony, which Mr. Eschenbach conducts here, in the orchestra's first New York appearance this season, may strike close to home. Nov. 15. Carnegie Hall. BRADLEY BROOKSHIRE Approaching the seventh annual concert of his eight-part survey of Bach's complete works for his instrument, Mr. Brookshire remains perhaps the most skilled and inventive Bach harpsichordist in New York. (No backhanded compliment intended, but that's another story.) Here Mr. Brookshire plays the ''French Overture,'' the ''Italian Concerto'' and the three- and six-part ricercares from ''A Musical Offering,'' along with a wild card: the premiere of Charles Wuorinen's ''Harpsichord Divisions.'' Nov. 16. St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212)378-0248. www.stbarts.org 'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' Britten's, that is, presented by the Juilliard Opera Center, directed by Eve Shapiro and conducted by David Atherton. (For that matter, Shakespeare's, too, presented by the Juilliard Drama Division during the same period -- a rare opportunity.) Nov. 16, 18, 20. Juilliard Theater. 'SHELTER' The Bang on a Can composers -- Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe -- return to BAM with another large-scale multimedia work, performed by the unlikely combination of the hard-charging musikFabrik and the ethereal Trio Mediaeval. The theme of the work, as described in BAM's brochure, takes on added resonance soon after a horrendous hurricane: '''Shelter' mines the myriad connotations of the work's title -- physical structures, intimate personal exchanges, a metaphoric home for our beliefs -- ultimately questioning whether what we build can protect us against the destructive power of the world around us.'' Nov. 16-19. BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100. www.bam.org DAVID ROBERTSON ''Seeing Debussy, Hearing Monet'': this is not what people have in mind when they talk about orchestras turning into museums. (By the way, how did ''museum'' come to be a pejorative? There are daring museums and stodgy ones, contemporary museums and classical ones. We might do better if some of our orchestras were more like certain museums. But that's for another day.) This concert, exploring the parallels between Debussy and Monet, is the first of four with the St. Louis Symphony in Mr. Robertson's Perspectives series at Carnegie. In two others, in the spring, they will perform Michael Jarrell's melodrama ''Cassandre'' and John Adams's Sept. 11 piece, ''On the Transmigration of Souls.'' Nov. 18. Carnegie Hall. ANNE-SOPHIE MUTTER It's a little hard to get around the cheesecake in the press kit (well, not all that painful), but the idea of Ms. Mutter's Mozart Project seems to be that she is recording (again, at least in large part) all of Mozart's major works for violin. The chamber works are still to come. Here, on two CD's, are the five concertos and the glorious Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola, with Yuri Bashmet. Ms. Mutter conducts the London Philharmonic Orchestra from the fiddle. November. Deutsche Grammophon. 'LA TRAVIATA' If you missed Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón in Verdi's opera at the Salzburg Festival this summer, you may want this recording. If you heard them, you may want it even more. November. Decca. December 'AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY' Having gotten back into the commissioning of operas a quarter-century ago, the Metropolitan Opera has carried on fitfully. John Harbison's ''Great Gatsby'' was the last to appear, in 1999. Tobias Picker's ''American Tragedy,'' based on the Dreiser novel, will be directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted (whatever the reason for James Levine's reticence) by James Conlon. To its credit, the Met is throwing a lot of vocal star power at the work: Patricia Racette, Susan Graham, Jennifer Larmore, William Burden, Nathan Gunn and others. Opens Dec. 2. Metropolitan Opera House. TRIO MEDIAEVAL It seemed almost too convenient, a couple of years ago, when this gifted female vocal trio appeared on the scene just as Anonymous IV was about to leave it. But subsequent concerts and recordings have only solidified the credentials of the trio, which is based in Oslo. A new recording, ''Stella Maris,'' is due out this month on ECM New Series. The trio's Christmas program here, laced with Norwegian traditional songs, is sure to be a delight. Dec. 10. Weill Recital Hall. ST. THOMAS CHOIR For years, when Gerre Hancock directed this choir, it presented the ''Messiah'' of choice in the New York holiday season. I have yet to hear how that ''Messiah'' may have changed under St. Thomas's new director of music, John Scott, but I have no reason to suspect anything less here. (I did hear Mr. Scott conduct the choir in Bach's ''St. John Passion'' in March, and you won't want to miss his reprise of that masterwork on April 4.) Dec. 13, 15. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212)664-9360. www.saintthomaschurch.org January MEREDITH MONK A workshop, ''Monk on Monk.'' Jan. 9-15. Carnegie Hall and Zankel Hall. A related article is on Page 88. BALTIMORE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The management's decision to hire Marin Alsop as the orchestra's next music director met with sharp resistance from the players when it was announced in July. Although the rancor was aimed mainly at management, for what was called a hasty hiring process, Ms. Alsop, who is to take over in 2007, also came in for direct criticism. Pleasantries were quickly re-established, but the first real test of the altered relationship comes here, as Ms. Alsop visits with music by Mozart, Dvorak and Christopher Rouse. Jan. 12-13. Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, (410)783-8000. www.baltimoresymphony.org JONATHAN NOTT This British conductor made a considerable impression in the spring, when he visited New York with both the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra and the Ensemble Intercontemporain. And that impression was only enhanced by the release of several of his Bamberg recordings by Tudor. He has set himself a difficult task in his New York Philharmonic program, with Strauss's ''Alpine Symphony,'' a big, lumbering work that doesn't get a lot of respect. (I, for one, would take it any day over, say, the ''Sinfonia Domestica.'') To fill out the program, the violinist Joshua Bell will play John Corigliano's ''Red Violin'' Concerto. Jan. 12, 14. Avery Fisher Hall. 'THE MANY FACES OF MOZART' Last season, before he was installed as music director of the New Jersey Symphony, Neeme Jarvi took over its annual winter festival and steered it toward one of his passions, Nordic music. Now that he is in place, he stands aside and lets others (Gilbert Varga, Bernard Labadie and Vladimir Feltsman) tend to the winter festivities kicking off Mozart's 250th-birthday year. (How come? Does Mr. Jarvi see where all this Mozart mania is heading?) Jan. 12-29. Halls in Newark, New Brunswick, Trenton and Princeton, (800)255-3476. www.njsymphony.org 'SCENES FROM GOETHE'S ''FAUST''' Schumann's work performed by the Cleveland Orchestra. Jan. 12, 14. Severance Hall, (216)231-1111. www.clevelandorch.com. A related article is on Page 86. 'THE ESSENCE OF LIGETI' The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center picks up where the Miller Theater left off in its season-opening celebration of Gyorgy Ligeti. In the middle program, the coruscating pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard plays several of the thorny études. Jan. 13, 15, 17. Alice Tully Hall. THOMAS HAMPSON The American baritone makes a stop in ''Song of America,'' a 12-city tour presented in part by the Library of Congress, which provides a touring exhibition of rare musical manuscripts. Wolfram Rieger is the pianist. EMI Classics is to supply a companion CD in November, just before the start of the tour, in Kansas City, Mo. Jan. 19. Carnegie Hall. MISSA SOLEMNIS Beethoven's sacred masterpiece is always an event, but the vocal soloists (to say nothing of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus) should lift this one to a lofty plane. They are Deborah Voigt, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson (if she is healthy and singing again in what is supposed to be a busy season for her), Ben Heppner and René Pape. Some team! Jan. 19-21. Symphony Hall, Boston, (617)266-1492. www.bso.org ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE If you feel compelled to program Mozart (as everyone does this season), you could hardly do better than John Eliot Gardiner and his forces. Here they offer a program of the last three symphonies (Nos. 39, 40, 41), soon to become a cliché, as it happens. And with the Monteverdi Choir, they perform the Mass in C minor alongside the Requiem. Jan. 22. Avery Fisher Hall. Jan. 23. Alice Tully Hall. 'THE PASSION OF OSVALDO GOLIJOV' Great Performers at Lincoln Center throws its considerable resources into a major, monthlong celebration of the Argentine-American composer, including two of his recent big works, the opera ''Ainadamar'' and the ''Pasión Según San Marcos.'' Jan. 22-Feb. 22. Various Lincoln Center theaters. BERLIN PHILHARMONIC Talk about dodging a bullet. Just a few years ago Carnegie Hall was contemplating a boneheaded merger with the New York Philharmonic -- in effect, closing in on New York. Now Carnegie is opening to the world, developing special relationships with far-flung orchestras. Its first is with the Berlin Philharmonic, which will present an eight-day residency involving community activities as well as concerts in 2007. In the meantime, Simon Rattle and the orchestra are visiting with four concerts, more than any other foreign orchestra this season. The repertory is rich and varied, ranging from Haydn and Mozart to Strauss and Mahler, from Schoenberg's Variations (Op. 31) and Ravel's ''Ma Mère l'Oye'' to the New York premieres of Thomas Adès's ''Asyla'' and Hanspeter Kyburz's ''Noesis.'' Both Carnegie and the Berlin Philharmonic seem, after a bit of foot-dragging, to be embracing the 21st century while other institutions slouch toward oblivion. Jan. 25-28. Carnegie Hall. 'THE MAGIC OF MOZART' It promises to be a hectic year for Mozart pilgrims. With the New Jersey Symphony winding down its multiweek festival and with John Eliot Gardiner and his forces having hit and run at Lincoln Center earlier in the week, the New York Philharmonic presents yet another wave of Mozart, with Lorin Maazel conducting the ''Coronation'' Mass, the ''Vesperae Solennes de Confessore'' and five mostly familiar symphonies, and Jeffrey Kahane playing and conducting two familiar piano concertos. Alas, it's that old Mozart magic that we know so well. Jan. 26-Feb. 14. Avery Fisher Hall. FOCUS! 2006 The Juilliard School's contemporary-music festival, in its 22nd season, is up to the minute. Subtitled ''New and Now,'' it features in each program a work commissioned by the school as part of its centennial celebration. The press material even lists a work by Paul Schoenfeld composed in 2006. Let's hear it for procrastination. Jan. 27, 30-31; Feb. 1-3. Juilliard Theater. HILLIARD ENSEMBLE This superb male vocal quartet spoiled us last season by appearing in a mixed conformation with the captivating soprano Joanne Lunn. But we should not hold it against the men for returning to their roots in music of Guillaume Dufay, Josquin Desprez and Nicolas Gombert. This is a typically compelling presentation of the treasurable series Music Before 1800. Jan. 29. Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212)666-9266. www.mb1800.org February STEVEN ISSERLIS It hardly seems possible that this brilliant and well established English cellist has yet to make his New York recital debut, but so says the Y. He does so in his usual thoughtful fashion, with music by a series of composers each of whom mentored the next: Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, Dvorak, Suk and Martinu. Feb. 7. 92nd Street Y. STAATSKAPELLE BERLIN Already, the orchestra's two Mozart programs begin to feel like piling on. Daniel Barenboim conducts the last three symphonies (Nos. 39-41) over two programs rather than one, as John Eliot Gardiner will already have done and as Lorin Maazel will be doing at the same time a few blocks uptown. Even before you hear it, it all begins to sound the same. Feb. 11-12. Carnegie Hall. ROYAL CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA Obviously Carnegie Hall is less vigilant about the duplication of major works in a season than it used to be. Or maybe it just doesn't shove the big guys around. Here, a mere three weeks after Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic let Richard Strauss blow his own horn in ''Ein Heldenleben,'' Mariss Jansons and his Amsterdam orchestra, in their second program, re-examine the life of our self-proclaimed hero. (Fortunately, this musical autobiography was written long before Strauss's involvement with the Nazis.) But in the first program comes an even more grandiose statement, this one less about Shostakovich himself than about his world in cataclysm: his mighty ''Leningrad'' Symphony, which Mr. Jansons should project to a noisy fare-thee-well. Feb. 14-15. Carnegie Hall. JAMES LEVINE Here are a couple of weeks that should tell much about the status of Mr. Levine's honeymoon with Boston Symphony audiences. The first week's program consists of three works by Schoenberg: the Five Pieces and the Variations for orchestra, and ''Pelleas und Melisande.'' The second week's sole offering is Schoenberg's ''Gurrelieder,'' a work steeped in Romanticism (but to know that, you have to be able to get past dread of the composer's name). In fact, Schoenberg even carries into a third week, with his Chamber Symphony No. 1, but all will be forgiven when Beethoven's Ninth Symphony follows. If Mr. Levine can pull off this kind of programming, he really has something going in Boston. Feb. 16-18, 21; Feb 23-25. Symphony Hall, (617)266-1492. www.bso.org KIROV OPERA Valery Gergiev and his hard-working company from St. Petersburg pay their annual visit to Washington, this time with Puccini's ''Turandot,'' Wagner's ''Parsifal'' and Verdi's Requiem. The quality of the performances may depend on just how hard the company has been working lately. The Kirov is now in its fourth year of a 10-year residency at the Kennedy Center, which, press materials say, was ''made possible by Alberto Vilar.'' So he paid in advance? Feb. 19-26. Kennedy Center, (202)467-4600; (800)444-1324. www.kennedy-center.org CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA Well, you have to admit, it isn't as obvious as, say, Kremerata Baltica. Even when I saw that the pianist Andras Schiff was playing and conducting, it didn't occur to me: Andrea Barca is Mr. Schiff's name in Italian. (Don't you hate having to admit your ignorance to a publicist?) The cappella is Mr. Schiff's hand-picked chamber orchestra, made up of notables including the entire Panocha Quartet. Here is still more Mozart, though it's likely to surpass most of what has come before. Over three concerts, Mr. Schiff will play six piano concertos and lead three other choice works, including the Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola. Feb. 21, 23, 25. Carnegie Hall. March VIENNA PHILHARMONIC Among the more laughable aspects of the fracas between Riccardo Muti and the Teatro Alla Scala in Milan last season (and there were many) were dire reports in the European press that Mr. Muti, tyrant that he obviously was, had burned his bridges and might never find gainful employ again. Conductors of Mr. Muti's stature are in short supply, and he is now, as he was before, in constant demand in the highest international circles. And a good thing for New York, which not only got to hear him in April in evident harmony with the New York Philharmonic but gets to hear him again here in one of his prime collaborations, with the proud (not to say haughty) Vienna Philharmonic, which is nobody's punching bag. The three concerts include the expected Germanic fare (Mozart, Schubert, Richard Strauss and Hindemith) as well as works by Bartok and Falla. It's the next best thing to having been at La Scala last May, when Mr. Muti returned with the Vienna Philharmonic in tow. March 3-5. Carnegie Hall. AUDRA McDONALD The Houston Grand Opera has commissioned a new opera for the Broadway star, to be presented as part of a one-woman double bill with Poulenc's ''Voix Humaine.'' In the new work, said to be a lighter foil to Poulenc's gloomy opus, Ms. McDonald will be surrounded by frequent collaborators: the composer Michael John LaChiusa, the director Lonny Price and the conductor Ted Sperling. Opens March 4. Wortham Theater Center, (713)228-6737; (800)626-7372. www.houstongrandopera.org RUSSIAN NATIONAL ORCHESTRA It's a bit perverse of Great Performers at Lincoln Center to attach the title ''Winter Dreams'' to the orchestra's Tchaikovsky minifestival, which does not include the wonderful ''Winter Dreams'' Symphony (No.1), too seldom heard. Instead, the first program offers the bombast of ''Manfred'' and the predictability of the First Piano Concerto (with Yefim Bronfman as soloist). The other programs, more constructively, explore Shakespeare through the lens of Tchaikovsky and Tchaikovsky through the lens of Stravinsky. The fast-rising young Russian maestro Vladimir Jurowski makes his New York orchestral debut. March 5, 6, 8. Avery Fisher Hall. 'MAZEPPA' No one has contributed more to the Russification of Western music over the last decade or two than Valery Gergiev, through visits by the Kirov Opera and Orchestra of the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg and through his own activities with Western ensembles. Mr. Gergiev's proselytizing continues apace at the Met, with a presentation of Tchaikovsky's Pushkin-based ''Mazeppa,'' produced in collaboration with the Maryinsky Theater. Yuri Alexandrov is the director. Opens March 6. Metropolitan Opera House. IAN BOSTRIDGE The peerless English tenor begins his Carnegie Hall Perspectives series with a program of Britten (''Winter Words'' and ''Canticles''), sharing the stage with the countertenor Bejun Mehta, the baritone Nathan Gunn, the pianist Julius Drake and others. A Bostridge recording of Britten orchestral song cycles with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic should already be out in November. Mr. Bostridge's later Perspectives concerts involve the Belcea Quartet, the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes and the soprano Dorothea Röschmann. March 8. Zankel Hall. 'TREEMONISHA' It is surprising that so little attention has been paid to this rousing opera during recent decades despite the sustained popularity of its creator, Scott Joplin. The Collegiate Chorale performs it here in a semistaged version -- a nice gesture, since Robert Shaw, the chorale's founder, presented the first modern performance of the work in 1971 (with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus). March 9. Alice Tully Hall. ATLANTA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Having heard the crack Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus in Mozart's Requiem with the Orchestra of St. Luke's in October, you can now hear the full Atlanta Symphony Chorus in Verdi's Requiem. Robert Spano, fresh from his first encounter with Wagner's ''Ring'' in Seattle last month, tackles this most operatic of liturgical works. March 11. Carnegie Hall. KIROV ORCHESTRA Shostakovich hardly needs a festival to make his way these days, any more than Mozart does. But it happens to be his centenary year, and attention is being paid -- perhaps nowhere more stylishly than at Lincoln Center. The Great Performers series is presenting all 15 string quartets, played by the Emerson String Quartet, and (over two seasons) all 15 symphonies, conducted by Valery Gergiev and divided between the two orchestras he directs, the Kirov and the Rotterdam Philharmonic. Mr. Gergiev kicks things off with the Symphonies Nos. 1, 2, 7, 9 and 10. March 12-13. Avery Fisher Hall. ALEXANDER LONQUICH This pianist, in his New York debut, may be someone to keep a close eye on. Reliable word out of Europe suggests that he is superb. The repertory, though extending from C.P.E. Bach to Wolfgang Rihm, is mostly basic: Mozart, Schumann and Chopin. March 15. 92nd Street Y. JORDI SAVALL Suffice it to say that Mr. Savall's performances at the Met Museum in April -- alone on his viola da gamba, with family members and with his ensembles -- were perhaps the early-music highlight of the last season. Mr. Savall will be active around the city, at Weill Recital Hall on March 2 and at the Miller Theater on March 4. Here he takes part in a gamba master class, a conversation and a concert by Hespèrion XXI. March 15-16. Metropolitan Museum. THOMAS QUASTHOFF The Carnegie calendar so far says only that the bass-baritone Mr. Quasthoff is singing works of Mahler and Schubert. That's good enough for me. Justus Zeyen is the pianist. March 18. Carnegie Hall. 'WALL TO WALL STRAVINSKY' The annual free 12-hour composer marathons at Symphony Space are among the more popular events in any New York concert season. But the immersion treatment should prove particularly apt and revealing with Stravinsky, who worked in so many radically different forms and styles over his career. The producers promise a little of everything, and it should be enough to make any compleatist's head spin. March 18. Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212)864-5400. www.symphonyspace.org LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Kurt Masur is loyal to his friends, and his appearance here, as music director of the orchestra, begins the way his tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic ended in 2002, with the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter playing Beethoven's Violin Concerto. The other music in these two programs is also vintage Masur, including Dvorak's Eighth Symphony and Mahler's First. March 20, 26. Avery Fisher Hall. 'LYSISTRATA' ''Or the Nude Goddess,'' goes the subtitle of this opera by Mark Adamo, presented at the New York City Opera. The New York Times report from the premiere in Houston in March pointed out that only a statue was nude. But it also implied that the work, with ''almost too many ideas for its own good,'' had room for improvement. Might some of those ideas have gone by the boards? Opens March 21. New York State Theater. VERDI'S REQUIEM It is distressing that the New York Philharmonic seems to be spending so much of the season lagging behind the curve. This performance, conducted by Lorin Maazel, follows not only Robert Spano's with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus at Carnegie Hall (by less than three weeks) but also Colin Davis's with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in September, in the same hall. Great Performances at Lincoln Center also anticipates the Philharmonic with a Mozart festival in Avery Fisher Hall -- John Eliot Gardner conducts Mozart's Symphonies Nos. 39-41 less than three weeks before Mr. Maazel does the same -- and with Tchaikovsky's Suite No. 3 and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 10. Well, at least the Philharmonic beats Lincoln Center to the punch with Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5. Don't these people talk to one another? March 29, 30; April 1, 4. Avery Fisher Hall. 'DON PASQUALE' James Levine, during his three decades at the Metropolitan Opera, has generally conducted new productions. But Donizetti's music here is so squarely focused on the voice and so heedless of the orchestra that it comes as a bit of a surprise to see the heavily burdened Mr. Levine busy himself with it. Certainly, those lustrous vocal parts should be well conveyed by Anna Netrebko and Juan Diego Flórez. Otto Schenk, as director, will have to stray far from his Germanic predilections to achieve the requisite light touch. Opens March 31. Metropolitan Opera House. April YOUNG CONCERT ARTISTS This organization's track record is good enough that when it presents its annual program of concertos, you can be pretty sure you'll hear at least one extraordinary performance -- and maybe three. My money here is on the double-bassist DaXun Zhang, who did a sensational stint with the Silk Road Project last year. But there is probably no reason to expect less of Lise de la Salle, a pianist, or Jose Franch-Ballester, a clarinetist. Keith Lockhart conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. April 5. Rose Theater. YO-YO MA Our reigning cellist has spoiled us by presenting all six Bach cello suites in a single evening. Still, only a miserable ingrate (who, me?) could feel shortchanged by a concert of three of these great works, the Suites Nos. 3, 5 and 6, in what promise to be brilliant and knowing performances. And think of the possibilities for encores. April 5. Carnegie Hall. NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Leonard Slatkin conducts a typical mix of new and old, American and European -- typical, at least, since a former regime at Carnegie discouraged some of his more adventurous programming. Works by Barber, Corigliano and Melinda Wagner sit alongside music by Beethoven, Rachmaninoff and Elgar. Emanuel Ax is the pianist in Beethoven's Third Concerto and Ms. Wagner's ''Extremity of Sky.'' April 6-7. Carnegie Hall. ROTTERDAM PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Valery Gergiev picks up his two-season survey of the Shostakovich symphonies with Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 15. April 9-10. Avery Fisher Hall. 'SOLOMON' Americans are likelier to know the early-music conductor René Jacobs from recordings than from live performances. And if you don't know his recordings, you should definitely remedy that in October, when his version of Handel's oratorio ''Saul'' comes out from Harmonia Mundi France; to judge from an advance copy, it is vivid and exciting in its search behind the letter for the spirit of the score. Whatever familiarity you do have with Mr. Jacobs's recent work is likely to make you run, not walk, to hear his performance of ''Solomon,'' another great Handel oratorio, with the English Voices and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. The countertenor Lawrence Zazzo, splendid as David in ''Saul,'' sings Solomon. Lisa Milne is his queen and Marie Arnet the Queen of Sheba. April 16. Alice Tully Hall. MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH If it's a Shostakovich year, can the composer's great friend be far behind? Mr. Rostropovich conducts the New York Philharmonic in Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1, with Maxim Vengerov as soloist, and the Symphony No. 10. Though Mr. Rostropovich is looking frail (by his standards) these days, expect vigor and passion. April 19-22. Avery Fisher Hall. SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Michael Tilson Thomas, who is recording all the Mahler symphonies with the orchestra, keeps it in fighting trim with the Adagio from the Symphony No. 10 in the first program, the Rückert Lieder (sung by Celena Schafer) in the second. April 19-20. Carnegie Hall. 'POCKET CONCERTOS' The Miller Theater, in its relentless pursuit of the new, institutes a three-year project of commissions for concertos with small chamber orchestra. The composers here are Julia Wolfe, John Musto, Ichizo Okashiro and Benedict Mason. And the solo instruments are as eccentric as tuba, double bass and accordion. April 22. Miller Theater. EMERSON STRING QUARTET As its part of Lincoln Center's Shostakovich centenary tribute, this esteemed group plays all 15 of the string quartets, as it did in 2000. Again, it will hew closely to chronological order, with only a couple of transpositions within programs to make for more effective sequences. (The deeply introspective and claustrophobic Eighth Quartet, in particular, almost has to come last to work its full power.) April 27, 30; May 4, 11, 14. Alice Tully Hall. VLADIMIR ASHKENAZY This veteran pianist is many things, but you don't necessarily think of him as a Bachian. So his recording of both books of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'' should tell a lot. Is he just keeping up with the Barenboims, or is he doing them one better? April. Decca. May 'RODELINDA' Renée Fleming is far from my notion of the ideal Handelian, but if her star power is what it takes to get the thing on the boards, so be it. This was the sleeper hit at the Met last season, and the addition of the splendid German countertenor Andreas Scholl can't hurt. Opens May 2. Metropolitan Opera House. 'PAULUS' Kent Tritle is so busy away from his church job that you tend to forget just how much he continues to accomplish there, especially with his invaluable series Sacred Music in a Sacred Space. Here he closes the season (begun on Oct. 20 with Haydn's ''Creation'') with a lovable oratorio by Mendelssohn, a more youthful, less grandiose sibling to ''Elijah.'' Mr. Tritle's chorus and orchestra are sure to put it across stylishly. May 4. Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212)288-2520. www.saintignatiusloyola.org MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE Milton Babbitt spent many years as the ultimate insider in contemporary American classical composition. Minimalism, the New Romanticism and other trends have since radically altered the scene, leaving Mr. Babbitt somewhat on the outside, looking in. But it is touching to see his longtime champions stand by him: specifically, in a program celebrating his 90th birthday, the conductor James Levine and the pianist Robert Taub. May 10. Weill Recital Hall. 'PARSIFAL' With admirable magnanimity, James Levine stepped aside in 2003 and deeded one of his favorite operas, which only he had conducted at the Met in a quarter-century, to Valery Gergiev. But good will runs only so far in the world of Wagnerian Realpolitik, and Mr. Levine has reclaimed his podium. The starry cast includes Ben Heppner, Waltraud Meier, Thomas Hampson and René Pape. Opens May 12. Metropolitan Opera House. VERIZON HALL ORGAN FESTIVAL Great pipe organs are coming back into the concert hall, whether reinstalled, as at Severance Hall in Cleveland; rebuilt, as at Symphony Hall in Boston; or newly built, as at Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles. The Kimmel Center in Philadelphia, the home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, is also installing a new one, among the largest in the United States, built by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders in Lake City, Iowa. And the center will celebrate the installation with a two-week festival, beginning with concerts of the Philadelphia Orchestra. May 11-25. Kimmel Center, (215)893-1955. www.kimmelcenter.org EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK Before there was Richard Strauss, before there was Hector Berlioz, there was a great orchestrator: Jean-Philippe Rameau. Frederick Renz leads his period-instrument band in suites from Rameau's operas and ballets. The season brochure lists no specific repertory. It hardly matters; whatever it is, it is sure to sparkle. May 20. St. James's Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street, (212)280-0330. www.EarlyMusicNY.org PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The orchestra enters a brave new music-director-less world this season, with Andrew Davis acting merely as music adviser. So it is evidently improvising a bit on tours, traveling this time in regal style, with Christoph von Dohnanyi in a program including Bartok's deeply involving Divertimento along with works of Haydn and Tchaikovsky. May 23. Carnegie Hall. 'GRENDEL' Elliot Goldenthal is the composer, but Julie Taymor, as co-librettist, director and puppet co-designer, may be the prime selling point of this new work, a riff on ''Beowulf.'' Eric Owens sings Grendel; Denyce Graves, the Dragon. The production will travel from Los Angeles to the Lincoln Center Festival, which was a partner in the commission. Opens May 27. Los Angeles Opera, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, (213)972-8001. www.laopera.com June 'FALSTAFF' The Falstaff of choice these days is Bryn Terfel, whom you can hear sprawling through Verdi's bawdy comedy beginning on Sept. 23 at the Met. Thomas Quasthoff may never be a rival onstage, because of his physical limitations, but his earthy voice and outsize personality should make a powerful and affecting impact in concert performances. The ones here, with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Franz Welser-Möst, end the orchestra's season with the usual bang. June 8, 11. Severance Hall, (216)231-1111. www.clevelandorch.com YURI TEMIRKANOV For his first concert as music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, in January 2000, Mr. Temirkanov led a towering performance of Mahler's ''Resurrection'' Symphony. Now, with a nice symmetry, he offers the same work in his last concert as music director (and with the same vocal soloists, Janice Chandler-Eteme and Nancy Maultsby). For those with long memories, these performances should tell much about how the orchestra has fared under Mr. Temirkanov's watch. Reports in the interim have mostly been positive, and if the performance matches or in any way surpasses that of 2000, it will indeed be memorable. June 8-9, 11. Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, (410)783-8000. www.baltimoresymphony.org. June 10. Music Center at Strathmore, (800)276-1444. www.bsoatstrathmore.org AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The recent Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center made much of Mozart's travels and even his nontravels -- to, for example, Russia, which he never visited. Leon Botstein, the American Symphony's music director, offers another take on the Russian connection, posthumous as it is, and a refreshingly offbeat approach to the Mozart year with concert performances of two small operas: Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Mozart and Salieri'' and Dargomizhsky's ''Stone Guest,'' which takes its cue, via Pushkin, from the vengeful statue of the Commendatore in ''Don Giovanni.'' June 11. Avery Fisher Hall. DANIEL BARENBOIM It seems just yesterday that the players of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra were complaining about their new music director, Daniel Barenboim. But Mr. Barenboim has survived for 17 years. (So is there hope for Christoph Eschenbach in Philadelphia after all?) Now the orchestra bids Mr. Barenboim farewell in grand fashion, with three concerts, each including a valedictory ninth symphony: Mahler's, in the first program, with Elliott Carter's ''Soundings''; Bruckner's, with Pierre Boulez's ''Notations I-VII''; and Beethoven's, with his ''Choral'' Fantasy.

The dial-up on the train - thank you, Verizon - may not set any speed records either, but at least it allows the Bagger to keep track of his plot to take over the world, along with his new hobby of obsessively tracking every wiggle and wobble of the Oscar race. He has noticed that ""A History of Violence,"" which was not getting much play a month ago, seems to be surging. And he is not the only one. EverythingOscar is suggesting that David Cronenberg is in the thick of the best director race.

Then came word Thursday morning that Vonage's chief executive, Michael Snyder, has abruptly stepped down and resigned from Vonages' its board of directors. Thursday's news release gave no reason for Mr. Snyder's departure, but the company is clearly in crisis mode. Its stock has lost more than 80 percent of its value since it went public in May, and Vonage is at risk of losing access to an important piece of technology that is the subject of a patent dispute with Verizon.",-0.3182,-0.928,-0.936,"        Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  Constraining  \

Shareholders overwhelmingly supported Vodafone’s management, with more than 93 percent of proxy voters against a recommendation by an activist investor group, Efficient Capital Structures, to spin off, or issue a tracking stock for, Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in the Verizon Wireless. Almost 95 percent of proxy voters, which make up the vast majority of Vodafone’s institutional investors, were also against Efficient Capital’s call for the issuance of new listed bonds to shareholders. Vodafone’s chief executive, Arun Sarin, above, praised Verizon Wireless’s growth and indicated the company had no plans to end its involvement.

With its announcement on Monday, Rhapsody, a joint venture by RealNetworks and MTV Networks, became the latest digital music service to do away with digital rights management, or D.R.M., which prevents users from making unauthorized copies of songs and can also determine which electronic devices can be used to listen to the songs. Apple has used D.R.M. since it began selling music on iTunes five years ago — and offers song previews at 30 seconds — but the other major download services, Amazon.com, Napster, Wal-Mart and eMusic, all sell music without restrictions. Rhapsody will restrict full-song previews to 25 a month, and the company also announced that users of Verizon’s V Cast service can listen to songs from Rhapsody through their cellphones.",0.0,-0.2732,-0.2732,"           Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \

More than 300 fans said that they were misled when they bought the tickets to Mr. Springsteen’s show this Monday night at the Verizon Center in Washington. In February, Ticketmaster said that it would change its sales policies as part of a settlement with the State of New Jersey after more than 2,000 Springsteen fans there made similar complaints. In a statement at Mr. Springsteen’s official Web site, brucespringsteen.net, his manager, Jon Landau, wrote that there “appear to be chronic problems” with how Ticketmaster uses TicketsNow and that he and Mr. Springsteen “deeply resent the abuse of our fans.”",0.0,-0.9081,-0.9081,"         Word  Modal  Negative  Positive  Uncertainty  Litigious  \
