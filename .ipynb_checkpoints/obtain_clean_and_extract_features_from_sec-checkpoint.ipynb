Business%%GENERAL%%Bell Atlantic Corporation (the \"Company\" or \"Bell Atlantic\") is one of the%%seven regional holding companies (\"RHCs\") formed in connection with the court-%%approved divestiture (the \"Divestiture\"), effective January 1, 1984, of those%%assets of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (\"AT&T\") related to%%exchange telecommunications, exchange access functions, printed directories and%%cellular mobile communications.%%Pursuant to the Divestiture, AT&T transferred to the Company, among other%%assets, its 100% ownership interest in seven Bell System operating companies%%(\"BOCs\"):   New Jersey Bell Telephone Company; The Bell Telephone Company of%%Pennsylvania; The Diamond State Telephone Company; The Chesapeake and Potomac%%Telephone Company; The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland; The%%Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia; and The Chesapeake and%%Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia (collectively, the \"Network Services%%Companies\").  In January 1994, to facilitate the creation of a uniform \"Bell%%Atlantic\" brand name across the territories served by these seven telephone%%subsidiaries, the names of the Network Services Companies were changed to Bell%%Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc. (\"Bell Atlantic - New Jersey\"), Bell Atlantic -%%Pennsylvania, Inc. (\"Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania\"), Bell Atlantic - Delaware,%%Inc. (\"Bell Atlantic - Delaware\"), Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C., Inc. (\"Bell%%Atlantic - Washington, D.C.\"), Bell Atlantic - Maryland, Inc. (\"Bell Atlantic -%%Maryland\"), Bell Atlantic - Virginia, Inc. (\"Bell Atlantic - Virginia\") and Bell%%Atlantic - West Virginia, Inc. (\"Bell Atlantic - West Virginia\"), respectively.%%The Company\\'s business currently encompasses two segments:  (1) Communications%%and Related Services, and (2) Financial, Real Estate, and Other Services.%%Financial information with respect to the Company\\'s industry segments is set%%forth in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by%%reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.%%The Communications and Related Services segment includes the Network Services%%Companies as well as subsidiaries which are engaged in the business of providing%%wireless communications products and services, including cellular mobile%%service; selling directory advertising and providing photocomposition services;%%servicing and repairing computers; and providing software for telecommunications%%and computer networking.  During 1993, Bell Atlantic reorganized certain%%functions performed by each of the Network Services Companies into nine lines of%%business (\"LOBs\") organized across the Network Services Companies around%%specific market segments.  See \"Communications and Related Services - The%%Network Services Companies - Operations\".%%The Financial, Real Estate, and Other Services segment is comprised of%%subsidiaries of the Company which are engaged in lease financing of commercial,%%industrial, medical and high-technology equipment, and other forms of financing;%%real estate investment and management; and the sale and distribution of%%liquefied petroleum gas.  In line with its continuing de-emphasis of financial%%services businesses over the past several years and its intensified focus on%%core communications businesses, the Company announced in October 1993 that it%%had begun evaluating possible strategies for exiting its financial services%%businesses.  In March 1994, the Company announced an agreement to sell a%%significant portion of its diversified leasing business to GFC Financial%%Corporation.  This sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 1994,%%subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals.  See \"Financial, Real Estate,%%and Other Services\".%%1%%The communications industry is currently undergoing fundamental changes driven%%by the accelerated pace of technological innovation, the convergence of the%%telecommunications, cable television, information services and entertainment%%businesses, and a regulatory environment in which many traditional regulatory%%barriers are being lowered and competition permitted or encouraged.  Although no%%definitive prediction can be made of the market opportunities these changes will%%present or whether Bell Atlantic will be able successfully to take advantage of%%these opportunities, the Company is positioning itself to be a leading%%communications, information services and entertainment company.%%The Company was incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware%%and has its principal executive offices at 1717 Arch Street, Philadelphia,%%Pennsylvania 19103 (telephone number 215-963-6000).%%LINE OF BUSINESS RESTRICTIONS%%The consent decree entitled \"Modification of Final Judgment\" (\"MFJ\") approved%%by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the \"D.C.%%District Court\") which, together with the Plan of Reorganization (\"Plan\")%%approved by the D.C. District Court, set forth the terms of Divestiture also%%established certain restrictions on the post-Divestiture activities of the RHCs,%%including Bell Atlantic.  The MFJ\\'s principal restrictions on post-Divestiture%%RHC activities included prohibitions on (i) providing interexchange%%telecommunications, (ii) providing information services, (iii) engaging in the%%manufacture of telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment%%(\"CPE\"), and (iv) entering into any non-telecommunications businesses, in each%%case without the approval of the D.C. District Court.  Since Divestiture, the%%D.C. District Court has retained jurisdiction over the construction,%%modification, implementation and enforcement of the MFJ.%%In September 1987, the D.C. District Court rendered a decision which%%eliminated the need for the RHCs to obtain its approval prior to entering into%%non-telecommunications businesses.  However, the D.C. District Court refused to%%eliminate the restrictions relating to equipment manufacturing or providing%%interexchange services.  With respect to information services, the Court issued%%a ruling in March 1988 which permitted the RHCs to engage in a number of%%information transport functions as well as voice storage and retrieval services,%%including voice messaging, electronic mail and certain information gateway%%services.  However, the RHCs were generally prohibited from providing the%%content of the data they transmitted.  As the result of an appeal of the D.C.%%District Court\\'s September 1987 and March 1988 decisions by the RHCs and other%%parties, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit%%ordered the D.C. District Court to reconsider the RHCs\\' request to provide%%information content and determine whether removal of the restrictions thereon%%would be in the public interest.  In July 1991, the D.C. District Court removed%%the remaining restrictions on RHC participation in information services, but%%imposed a stay pending appeal of that decision.  In October 1991, the United%%States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the stay,%%thereby permitting the RHCs to provide information services, and in May 1993%%affirmed the D.C. District Court\\'s July 1991 decision.  The United States%%Supreme Court denied certiorari in November 1993.%%Several bills have been introduced in the current session of Congress%%pursuant to which the line of business restrictions established by the MFJ could%%be eliminated or modified.  No definitive prediction can be made as to whether%%or when any such legislation will be enacted, the provisions thereof or their%%impact on the business or financial condition of the Company.%%2%%COMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED SERVICES%%The Network Services Companies%%General%%The Network Services Companies presently serve a territory (\"Territory\")%%consisting of 19 Local Access and Transport Areas (\"LATAs\").  These LATAs are%%generally centered on a city or based on some other identifiable common%%geography and, with certain limited exceptions, each LATA marks the boundary%%within which a Network Services Company may provide telephone service.%%The Network Services Companies provide two basic types of telecommunications%%services. First, they transport telecommunications traffic between subscribers%%located within the same LATA (\"intraLATA service\"), including both local and%%toll services. Local service includes the provision of local exchange (\"dial%%tone\"), local private line and public telephone services (including dial tone%%service for pay telephones owned by the Company and other pay telephone%%providers). Among other local services provided are Centrex (telephone company%%central office-based switched telephone service enabling the subscriber to%%make both intercom and outside calls) and a variety of special and custom%%calling services. Toll service includes message toll service (calling service%%beyond the local calling area) within LATA boundaries, and intraLATA Wide Area%%Toll Service (WATS)/800 services (volume discount offerings for customers with%%highly concentrated demand). As permitted by the Plan, Bell Atlantic - New%%Jersey and Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania also earn toll revenue from the%%provision of telecommunications service between LATAs (\"interLATA service\") in%%corridors between the cities (and certain surrounding counties) of (i) New%%York, New York and Newark, New Jersey and (ii) Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and%%Camden, New Jersey. Second, the Network Services Companies provide exchange%%access service, which links a subscriber\\'s telephone or other equipment to the%%transmission facilities of interexchange carriers which, in turn, provide%%interLATA service to their customers. Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania, Bell%%Atlantic -Delaware, Bell Atlantic - Maryland and Bell Atlantic - West Virginia%%also provide exchange access service to interexchange carriers which provide%%intrastate intraLATA long distance telecommunications service. See%%\"Communications and Related Services -The Network Services Companies -%%Competition - IntraLATA Toll Competition\".%%Operations%%Although the Network Services Companies remain responsible within their%%respective service areas for the provision of telephone services, financial%%performance and regulatory matters, during 1993, Bell Atlantic reorganized%%certain functions formerly performed by each of these companies relating to%%these telephone services into nine LOBs organized across the Network Services%%Companies around specific market segments.  These nine LOBs are:%%The Consumer Services LOB markets communications services to residential%%-----------------%%customers within the Territory (11 million households and 29 million people) and%%plans in the future to market information services and entertainment%%programming.  1993 revenues generated by consumer services were approximately $4%%billion, representing approximately 34% of the Network Services Companies\\'%%aggregate revenues.  These revenues were derived primarily from the provision of%%telephone services to residential users.%%The Carrier Services LOB markets (i) switched and special access to the%%----------------%%Network Services Companies\\' local exchange networks, and (ii) billing and%%collection services, including recording, rating, bill processing and bill%%rendering.  1993 revenues generated by the carrier market were approximately%%$2.5 billion, representing approximately 21% of the Network Services Companies\\'%%aggregate revenues.  Approximately 93% of total carrier services revenues were%%derived from interexchange carriers; AT&T is the largest single customer.  Most%%of the remaining revenues came from business customers and government agencies%%with their own special access network connections, wireless customers and other%%local exchange carriers (\"LECs\") which resell network connections to their own%%customers.%%3%%The Small Business Services LOB markets communications and information%%-----------------------%%services to small businesses (customers having up to 20 access lines or 100%%Centrex lines).  The Network Services Companies have approximately 1.2 million%%small business customers in the Territory which in 1993 generated approximately%%$1.7 billion in revenues, representing approximately 15% of the Network Services%%Companies\\' aggregate revenues.%%The Large Business Services LOB markets communications and information%%-----------------------%%services to large businesses (customers having more than 20 access lines or%%more than 100 Centrex lines). These services include voice%%switching/processing services (e.g., dedicated private lines, custom Centrex,%%----%%call management and voice messaging), end-user networking (e.g., credit and%%----%%debit card transactions, and personal computer-based conferencing, including%%data and video), internetworking (establishing links between the%%geographically disparate networks of two or more companies or within the same%%company), network integration (integrating multiple geographically disparate%%networks into one system), network optimization (disaster avoidance, 911,%%intelligent vehicle highway systems), video services (distance learning,%%telemedicine, surveillance, videoconferencing) and integrated multi-media%%applications services. The Network Services Companies serve more than 18,000%%primarily in-Territory large business customers in the commercial, state and%%local government and education markets. 1993 revenues from the large business%%market were approximately $1.5 billion, representing approximately 13% of the%%Network Services Companies\\' aggregate revenues.%%The Directory Services LOB manages the provision of (i) advertising and%%------------------%%marketing services to advertisers, and (ii) listing information (e.g., White%%----%%Pages and Yellow Pages). These services are currently provided primarily%%through print media, but the Company expects that use of electronic formats%%will increase in the future. In addition, the Directory Services LOB manages%%the provision of photocomposition, database management and other related%%products and services to publishers. 1993 revenues from directory services%%were approximately $1 billion, representing approximately 9% of the Network%%Services Companies\\' aggregate revenues.%%The Public and Operator Services LOB markets pay telephone and operator%%----------------------------%%services in the Territory to meet consumer needs for accessing public networks,%%locating and identifying network subscribers, providing calling assistance and%%arranging billing alternatives (e.g., calling card, collect and third party%%----%%calls).  1993 revenues from public and operator services were approximately $663%%million, representing approximately 6% of the Network Services Companies\\'%%aggregate revenues.%%The Federal Systems LOB markets communications and information technology and%%---------------%%services to departments, agencies and offices of the executive, judicial and%%legislative branches of the federal government.  1993 revenues from the federal%%government market were approximately $200 million, representing approximately 2%%%of the Network Services Companies\\' aggregate revenues.%%The Information Services LOB has been established to provide programming%%--------------------%%services, including on-demand entertainment, transactions and interactive%%multimedia applications within the Territory and in selected other markets.  See%%\"Communications and Related Services - The Network Services Companies - FCC%%Regulation and Interstate Rates - Telephone Company Provision of Video Dial Tone%%and Video Programming\".%%The Network LOB manages the technologies, services and systems platforms%%-------%%required by the other eight LOBs and the Network Services Companies to meet the%%needs of their respective customers, including, without limitation, switching,%%feature development and on-premises installation and maintenance services.%%4%%The Network Services Companies have been making and expect to continue to make%%significant capital expenditures on their networks to meet the demand for%%communications services and to further improve such services.  Capital%%expenditures of the Network Services Companies were approximately $2.3 billion%%in 1991, $2.2 billion in 1992 and $2.1 billion in 1993.  The total investment in%%plant, property and equipment decreased from approximately $30.7 billion at%%December 31, 1991 to approximately $29.6 billion at December 31, 1992, and%%increased to approximately $30.6 billion at December 31, 1993, in each case%%after giving effect to retirements, but before deducting accumulated%%depreciation at such date.%%The Network Services Companies as a whole are projecting construction%%expenditures for 1994 at approximately the same level as in the past several%%years.  However, subject to regulatory approvals, the Network Services Companies%%plan to allocate capital resources to the deployment of broadband network%%platforms (technologies ultimately capable of providing a switched facility for%%access to and transport of high-speed data services, video-on-demand, and image%%and interactive multimedia applications).  Most of the funds for these%%expenditures are expected to be generated internally.  Some additional external%%financing may be necessary or desirable for some of the Network Services%%Companies.%%FCC Regulation and Interstate Rates%%The Network Services Companies are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal%%Communications Commission (\"FCC\") with respect to interstate services and%%certain related matters.  The FCC prescribes a uniform system of accounts for%%telephone companies, interstate depreciation rates and the principles and%%standard procedures used to separate plant investment, expenses, taxes and%%reserves between those applicable to interstate services under the jurisdiction%%of the FCC and those applicable to intrastate services under the jurisdiction of%%the respective state regulatory authorities (\"separations procedures\").  The FCC%%also prescribes procedures for allocating costs and revenues between regulated%%and unregulated activities.%%Interstate Access Charges%%The Network Services Companies provide intraLATA service and, with certain%%limited exceptions, do not participate in the provision of interLATA service%%except through offerings of exchange access service.  See \"Communications and%%Related Services - The Network Services Companies - General\".  The FCC has%%prescribed structures for exchange access tariffs to specify the charges%%(\"Access Charges\") for use and availability of the Network Services Companies\\'%%facilities for the origination and termination of interstate interLATA service.%%Access Charges are intended to recover the related costs of the Network Services%%Companies which have been allocated to the interstate jurisdiction (\"Interstate%%Costs\") under the FCC\\'s separations procedures.%%In general, the tariff structures prescribed by the FCC provide that%%Interstate Costs of the Network Services Companies which do not vary based on%%usage (\"non-traffic sensitive costs\") are recovered from subscribers through%%flat monthly charges (\"Subscriber Line Charges\"), and from interexchange%%carriers through usage-sensitive Carrier Common Line (\"CCL\") charges.  See%%\"Communications and Related Services - The Network Services Companies - FCC%%Regulation and Interstate Rates - FCC Access Charge Pooling Arrangements\".%%Traffic-sensitive Interstate Costs are recovered from carriers through variable%%access charges based on several factors, primarily usage.%%In May 1984, the FCC authorized the implementation of Access Charge tariffs%%for \"switched access service\" (access to the local exchange network) and of%%Subscriber Line Charges for multiple line business customers (up to $6.00 per%%month per line).  In 1985, the FCC authorized Subscriber Line Charges for%%residential and single-line business customers at the rate of $1.00 per month%%per line, which increased in installments to $3.50 effective April 1, 1989.%%5%%As a result of the phasing in of Subscriber Line Charges, a substantial%%portion of non-traffic sensitive Interstate Costs is now recovered directly from%%subscribers, thereby reducing the per-minute CCL charges to interexchange%%carriers.  This significant reduction in CCL charges has tended to reduce the%%incentive for interexchange carriers and their high-volume customers to bypass%%the Network Services Companies\\' switched network via special access lines or%%alternative communications systems.  However, competition for this access%%business has increased in recent years.  See \"Communications and Related%%Services - The Network Services Companies - Competition - Alternative Access and%%Local Services\".%%FCC Access Charge Pooling Arrangements%%The FCC previously required that all LECs, including the Network Services%%Companies, pool revenues from CCL and Subscriber Line Charges that cover the%%non-traffic sensitive costs of the local exchange network, that is, the%%Interstate Costs associated with the lines from subscribers\\' premises to%%telephone company central offices. To administer such pooling arrangements,%%the FCC mandated the formation of the National Exchange Carrier Association,%%Inc. Some LECs received more revenue from the pool than they billed their%%interexchange carrier customers using the nationwide average CCL rate. Other%%companies, including all but one of the Network Services Companies, received%%substantially less from the pool than the amount billed to their interexchange%%carrier customers.%%By an order adopted in 1987, the FCC changed its mandatory pooling%%requirements. These changes, which became effective April 1, 1989,%%permitted all of the Network Services Companies as a group to withdraw from%%the pool and to charge CCL rates which more closely reflect their non-traffic%%sensitive costs. The Network Services Companies are still obligated to make%%contributions of CCL revenues to companies who choose to continue to pool non-%%traffic sensitive costs so that the pooling companies can charge a CCL rate no%%greater than the nationwide average CCL rate. In addition to this continuing%%obligation, the Network Services Companies have a transitional support%%obligation to high cost companies who left the pool in 1989 and 1990. This%%transitional support obligation phases out over five years. These long-term%%and transitional support requirements will be recovered in the Network%%Services Companies\\' CCL rates.%%Depreciation%%Depreciation rates provide for the recovery of the Network Services Companies\\'%%investment in telephone plant and equipment, and are revised periodically to%%reflect more current estimates of remaining service lives and future net%%salvage values. In October 1993, the FCC issued an order simplifying the%%depreciation filing process by reducing the information required for certain%%categories of plant and equipment whose remaining service life, salvage%%estimates and depreciation rates fall within an approved range. Petitions for%%reconsideration of that order were filed in December 1993. In November 1993,%%the FCC issued a further order inviting comments on proposed ranges for an%%initial group of categories of plant and equipment.%%Price Caps%%In September 1990, the FCC adopted \"price cap\" regulation to replace the%%traditional rate of return regulation of LECs.  LEC price cap regulation became%%effective on January 1, 1991.%%The price cap system places a cap on overall prices for interstate services%%and requires that the cap decrease annually, in inflation-adjusted terms, by a%%fixed percentage which is intended to reflect expected increases in%%productivity.  The price cap level can also be adjusted to reflect \"exogenous\"%%changes, such as changes in FCC separations procedures or accounting rules.%%LECs subject to price caps have somewhat increased flexibility to change the%%prices of existing services within certain groupings of interstate services,%%known as \"baskets\".%%6%%Under price cap regulation, the FCC set an authorized rate of return of 11.25%%%for the years 1991 and beyond.  To the extent that a company is able to earn a%%higher rate of return through improved efficiency, the FCC\\'s price cap rules%%permit them to retain the full amount of this higher return up to 100 basis%%points above the authorized rate of return (currently, up to a 12.25% rate of%%return).  If a company\\'s rate of return is between 100 and 500 basis points%%above the authorized rate of return (that is, currently, between 12.25% and%%16.25%), the company must share 50% of the earnings above the 100-basis-point%%level with customers by reducing rates prospectively.  All earnings above the%%500-basis-point level must be returned to customers in the form of prospective%%rate decreases.  If, on the other hand, a company\\'s rate of return is more than%%100 basis points below the authorized rate of return (that is, currently, below%%10.25%), the company is permitted to increase rates prospectively to make up the%%deficiency.%%Under FCC-approved tariffs, the Network Services Companies are charging%%uniform rates for interstate access services (with the exception of Subscriber%%Line Charges) throughout the Territory and are regarded as a single unit by the%%FCC for rate of return measurement.%%On February 16, 1994, the FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to determine%%the effectiveness of LEC price cap rules and decide what changes, if any, should%%be made to those rules.  This rulemaking is expected to be concluded by the end%%of 1994.%%In January 1993, the FCC denied the Network Services Companies exogenous%%treatment of the increased expense for postretirement benefits required under%%Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, \"Employers\\' Accounting for%%Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions\", which the Company adopted%%effective January 1, 1991.  The Network Services Companies have appealed this%%decision.  The appeal is likely to be decided during the second half of 1994.%%Computer Inquiry III%%In August 1985, the FCC initiated Computer Inquiry III to re-examine its%%regulations requiring that \"enhanced services\" (e.g., voice messaging services,%%----%%electronic mail, videotext gateway, protocol conversion) be offered only through%%a structurally separated subsidiary.  In 1986, the FCC eliminated this%%requirement, permitting the Network Services Companies to offer enhanced%%services, subject to compliance with a series of nonstructural safeguards%%designed to promote an effectively competitive market.  These safeguards include%%detailed cost accounting, protection of customer information and certain%%reporting requirements.%%In June 1990, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated%%and remanded the Computer Inquiry III decisions to the FCC, finding that the FCC%%had not fully justified those decisions.  In December 1991, the FCC adopted an%%order which reinstated relief from the separate subsidiary requirement upon a%%company\\'s compliance with the FCC\\'s Computer III Open Network Architecture%%(\"ONA\") requirements and strengthened some of the nonstructural safeguards.  In%%the interim, the Network Services Companies had filed interstate tariffs%%implementing the ONA requirements.  Those tariffs became effective in February%%1992, subject to further investigation.  That investigation was completed on%%December 15, 1993, when an order was released making minor changes to the%%Network Services Companies\\' ONA rates.  In March 1992, the Network Services%%Companies certified to the FCC that they had complied with all initial ONA%%obligations and therefore should be granted structural relief for enhanced%%services.  The FCC granted the Network Services Companies structural relief in%%June 1992.  Other parties have appealed this decision, which remains in effect%%pending the outcome of the appeal.  A decision on the appeal is likely by the%%end of 1994.%%7%%The FCC\\'s December 1991 order has been appealed to the United States Court of%%Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by several parties.  Pending decision on those%%appeals, the FCC\\'s decision remains in effect.  If a court again reverses the%%FCC, the Network Services Companies\\' right to offer enhanced services could be%%impaired.%%FCC Cost Allocation and Affiliate Transaction Rules%%In 1987, the FCC adopted rules governing (i) the allocation of costs between%%the regulated and unregulated activities of a communications common carrier and%%(ii) transactions between the regulated and unregulated affiliates of a%%communications common carrier.%%The cost allocation rules apply to certain unregulated activities:  activities%%that have never been regulated as communications common carrier offerings and%%activities that have been preemptively deregulated by the FCC. The costs of%%these activities are removed prior to the separations procedures process and%%are allocated to unregulated activities in the aggregate, not to specific%%services, for pricing purposes. Other activities must be accounted for as%%regulated activities, and their costs are subject to separations procedures.%%These activities include (i) those which have been deregulated by the FCC%%without preempting state regulation, (ii) those which have been deregulated by%%a state but not the FCC and (iii) \"incidental activities,\" which cannot, in%%the aggregate, generate more than 1% of a company\\'s revenues. Since the%%Network Services Companies engage in these types of activities, the Network%%Services Companies, pursuant to the FCC\\'s cost allocation rules, filed a cost%%allocation manual, which manual has been approved by the FCC.%%The affiliate transaction rules govern the pricing of assets transferred to%%and services provided by affiliates.  These rules generally require that assets%%be transferred between affiliates at \"market price\", if such price can be%%established through a tariff or a prevailing price actually charged to third%%parties.  In the absence of a tariff or prevailing price, \"market price\" cannot%%be established, in which case (i) asset transfers from a regulated to an%%unregulated affiliate must be valued at the higher of cost or fair market value,%%and (ii) asset transfers from an unregulated to a regulated affiliate must be%%valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.  The affiliate transaction%%rules require that a service provided by one affiliate to another affiliate,%%which service is also provided to unaffiliated entities, must be valued at%%tariff rates or market prices.  If the affiliate does not also provide the%%service to unaffiliated entities, the price must be determined in accordance%%with the FCC\\'s cost allocation principles.  In October 1993, the FCC proposed%%new affiliate transaction rules which would essentially eliminate the different%%rules for the provision of services and apply the asset transfer rules to all%%affiliate transactions.  The Network Services Companies have filed comments%%opposing the proposed rules.%%The FCC has not attempted to make its cost allocation or affiliate transaction%%rules preemptive.  State regulatory authorities are free to use different cost%%allocation methods and affiliate transaction rules for intrastate ratemaking and%%to require carriers to keep separate allocation records.%%Telephone Company Provision of Video Dial Tone and Video Programming%%In 1987, the FCC initiated an inquiry into whether developments in the cable%%and telephone industries warranted changes in the rules prohibiting telephone%%companies such as the Network Services Companies from providing video%%programming in their respective service territories directly or indirectly%%through an affiliate.%%8%%In November 1991, the FCC released a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in%%these proceedings.  In August 1992, the FCC issued an order permitting telephone%%companies such as the Network Services Companies to provide \"video dial tone\"%%service.  Video dial tone permits telephone companies to provide video transport%%to multiple programmers on a non-discriminatory common carrier basis.  The FCC%%has also ruled that neither telephone companies that provide video dial tone%%service, nor video programmers that use these services, are required to obtain%%local cable franchises.  Other parties have appealed these orders, which remain%%in effect pending the outcome of the appeal.%%In late 1992, Bell Atlantic - New Jersey entered into agreements pursuant to%%which, pending regulatory approval, it would provide video dial tone transport%%services to two video programmers in New Jersey.  As contemplated by its%%contract with Sammons Communications, Incorporated (\"Sammons\"), Bell Atlantic -%%New Jersey will deploy fiber optic technology that will enable Sammons and other%%video information providers to deliver video programming in three Morris County,%%New Jersey communities over a video dial tone platform.  Bell Atlantic - New%%Jersey\\'s contract with Future Vision of America Corporation (\"Future Vision\")%%contemplates that Bell Atlantic - New Jersey will deploy fiber optic technology%%in the Dover Township, New Jersey telephone network to establish a video dial%%tone platform that will allow Future Vision and other video information%%providers to deliver competitive video programming services in that community.%%Applications for approval to deploy these video dial tone systems are pending at%%the FCC.%%In December 1992, Bell Atlantic - Virginia and Bell Atlantic Video Services%%Company filed a lawsuit against the federal government in the United States%%District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia seeking to overturn the%%prohibition in the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 against LECs%%providing video programming in their respective service areas.  In a decision%%rendered in August 1993 and clarified in October 1993, the court struck down%%this prohibition as a violation of the First Amendment\\'s freedom of speech%%protections and enjoined its enforcement against the Company, the Network%%Services Companies and Bell Atlantic Video Services Company.  This decision has%%been appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.%%In early 1993, the FCC granted the Company authority to test a new technology%%known as Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (\"ADSL\") for use in delivering%%video entertainment and information over existing copper telephone lines.%%Beginning in March 1993, the Company began a one-year technical trial of ADSL%%serving up to 400 Bell Atlantic employees in northern Virginia. In the Fall of%%1993, Bell Atlantic petitioned the FCC for authorization to expand and convert%%this technical trial, upon its completion, into a six month market trial%%serving up to 2,000 customers. Bell Atlantic also requested authority to offer%%a commercial video dial tone service to customers served by 25 central offices%%in parts of northern Virginia and southern Maryland upon completion of the six%%month market trial. These applications are pending at the FCC.%%Interconnection and Collocation%%In October 1992, the FCC issued an order allowing third parties to collocate%%their equipment in telephone company offices to provide special access (private%%line) services to the public.  The FCC\\'s stated purpose was to encourage greater%%competition in the provision of interstate special access services.  The order%%permits collocating parties to pay LECs an interconnection charge that is lower%%than the existing tariffed rates for similar non-collocated services; it allows%%LECs limited additional pricing flexibility for their own special access%%services when collocated interconnection is operational.  In February 1993, the%%Network Services Companies filed interstate tariffs to allow collocation for%%special access services. These tariffs are currently effective. The Company%%and certain other parties have appealed the FCC\\'s special access collocation%%order. Bell Atlantic expects the appeal to be decided in 1994.%%9%%On September 2, 1993, the FCC extended collocation to switched access%%services.  The terms and conditions for switched access collocation are similar%%to those for special access collocation.  On November 18, 1993, the Network%%Services Companies filed interstate tariffs to allow collocation for switched%%access services.  These tariffs became effective on February 16, 1994.  The%%Company and certain other parties have appealed the FCC\\'s switched access%%collocation order. Appeals of this order have been stayed pending a decision on%%the appeals of the special access collocation order.%%Increased competition through collocation will adversely affect the revenues%%of the Network Services Companies, although some of the lost revenues could be%%offset by increased demand of the Network Services Companies\\' own special%%access services as a result of the slightly increased pricing flexibility that%%the FCC has permitted. The Company does not expect the net revenue impact of%%special access collocation to be material. Revenue losses from switched access%%collocation, however, may be larger than from special access collocation.%%Intelligent Networks%%In December 1991, the FCC issued a Notice of Inquiry into the plans of the%%BOCs, including the Network Services Companies, to deploy new \"modular\" network%%architectures, such as Advanced Intelligent Network (\"AIN\") technology.  The%%Notice of Inquiry asks what, if any, regulatory action the FCC should take to%%assure that such architectures are deployed in a manner that is \"open,%%responsive, and procompetitive\".  On August 31, 1993, the FCC issued a Notice of%%Proposed Rulemaking proposing a schedule for AIN deployment.  The proposals in%%that Notice of Proposed Rulemaking generally follow those that the Company%%proposed in its response to the Notice of Inquiry.  The Company cannot estimate%%when the FCC will conclude this proceeding.%%The results of this proposed rulemaking could include a requirement that the%%Network Services Companies offer individual components of their services, such%%as switching and transport, to competitors who will provide the remainder of%%such services through their own facilities.  Such increased competition could%%divert revenues from the Network Services Companies.  However, deployment of AIN%%technology may also enable the Network Services Companies to respond more%%quickly and efficiently to customer requests for new services.  This could%%result in increased revenues from new services that could at least partially%%offset losses resulting from increased competition.%%State Regulation and Intrastate Rates%%The communications services of the Network Services Companies are subject to%%regulation by the public utility commissions in the jurisdictions in which they%%operate with respect to intrastate rates and services and other matters.  In%%1993, there were a number of proceedings dealing with such issues as the various%%Network Services Companies\\' rates of return, the adoption of flexible regulation%%procedures and the introduction of competition for local exchange and local%%access services.%%Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc. (formerly New Jersey Bell Telephone Company)%%In June 1987, the New Jersey Board of Regulatory Commissioners (\"NJBRC\")%%(which was then known as the Board of Public Utilities) issued an order%%approving a Rate Stability Plan (\"RSP\") that modified the way the NJBRC monitors%%Bell Atlantic - New Jersey\\'s intrastate earnings.  Rather than continue to%%monitor overall company financial performance, the RSP authorized financial%%performance surveillance only of less competitive services.  The RSP also capped%%intrastate tariffed rates for its six year duration (July 1, 1987 through June%%30, 1993), subject, however, to certain exceptions which would permit Bell%%Atlantic - New Jersey to seek increases in tariffed rates during the RSP\\'s%%fourth through sixth years.%%10%%The RSP separated Bell Atlantic - New Jersey\\'s intrastate services into two%%categories: Group I (more competitive) services such as directory advertising,%%Centrex, pay telephone services, billing and collection services, high%%capacity channel and special access services, public data networks, central%%office local area networks, pay-per-view ordering service, high capacity%%digital hand-off service, Bellboy(R) paging service, 911 enhanced terminal%%equipment and Home Intercom; and Group II (less competitive) services such as%%local exchange service, local usage, message toll service, 800 data base%%complementary service and Repeat Call and Return Call. Only the Group II%%services were subject to financial performance monitoring by the NJBRC for the%%purpose of determining whether or not Bell Atlantic - New Jersey was earning%%the target rate of return for those services. In January 1989, the NJBRC%%issued an order which established a target rate of return on equity of 12.9%%%for the purpose of monitoring the financial performance of the Group II%%category of services. Under the RSP, Bell Atlantic - New Jersey was allowed to%%charge competitive rates for Group I services, without restriction and without%%financial performance monitoring.%%The New Jersey Telecommunications Act of 1992 (the \"NJ Telecommunications%%Act\") became effective in January 1992.  The NJ Telecommunications Act%%authorized the NJBRC to adopt alternative regulatory frameworks that provide%%incentives to telecommunications companies for aggressive deployment of new%%technologies.  It also deregulated services which the NJBRC has found to be%%competitive.  Pursuant to that legislation, Bell Atlantic - New Jersey filed its%%Plan for Alternative Form of Regulation in March 1992, and a revised plan in May%%1992.  This revised plan was unanimously approved by the NJBRC in December 1992,%%with certain modifications; the written order reflecting that approval was%%issued on May 6, 1993.  Bell Atlantic - New Jersey filed a plan conforming to%%the NJBRC\\'s order (the \"NJ PAR\"), which became effective on May 20, 1993.%%Several parties have filed judicial appeals of the NJBRC\\'s order.  The briefing%%schedule for this appeal extends through the middle of August 1994.%%The NJ PAR, which supersedes the RSP, divides Bell Atlantic - New Jersey\\'s%%services into Rate-Regulated Services (formerly Group II services) and%%Competitive Services (formerly Group I and services which have never been%%regulated by the NJBRC).  Under this Plan, Bell Atlantic - New Jersey\\'s Rate-%%Regulated Services are grouped in two categories:%%- \"Protected Services\":  Basic residence and business service, Touch-Tone,%%access services, message toll services and the ordering, installation and%%restoration of these services. Rates for Protected Services, other than basic%%residence service, may be increased beginning January 1996 in an amount%%limited to the prior year\\'s increase in the Gross National Product-Price Index%%(\"GNP-PI\") less a 2% productivity offset, as long as the return on equity for%%Rate-Regulated Services does not exceed 11.7%. Basic residence service rates%%are frozen through December 1999.%%- \"Other Services\":  Custom calling, Custom Local Area Signaling Services%%(\"CLASS\" services which utilize Signaling System 7), operator services and 911%%enhanced service.  Rates for Other Services may be increased beginning January%%1996 in an amount limited to the prior year\\'s increase in the GNP-PI less a 2%%%productivity offset, as long as the return on equity for Rate-Regulated Services%%does not exceed 12.7%.%%All earnings above a return on equity of 13.7% for Rate-Regulated Services%%will be shared equally with customers. There is no point at which the earnings%%are capped.%%Competitive Services are deregulated under the NJ Telecommunications Act.%%Other services such as premises wire maintenance, Answer Call and electronic%%messaging, which have never been regulated by the NJBRC, continue to be%%deregulated under the NJ Telecommunications Act.%%11%%Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania, Inc. (formerly The Bell Telephone Company of%%Pennsylvania)%%Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania continues to operate under traditional rate-of-%%return regulation, but is pursuing regulatory reform through regulatory%%channels.%%In October 1992, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (\"PPUC\") adopted%%financial reporting rules that exclude revenues, expenses and investment%%associated with directory advertising from quarterly earnings surveillance%%reports, although these rules require Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania to file an%%annual informational filing including directory advertising earnings.  The PPUC%%made no finding relative to future ratemaking treatment for directory%%advertising.%%On July 8, 1993, legislation was enacted in Pennsylvania which enables Bell%%Atlantic - Pennsylvania to petition the PPUC to regulate Bell Atlantic -%%Pennsylvania under an alternative form of regulation other than rate-based%%rate of return. On October 1, 1993, Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania filed its%%petition and plan with the PPUC which contained (i) six proposed competitive%%services (directory advertising, billing services, Centrex, Speed Call, Repeat%%Call and paging) for removal from price and earnings regulations, (ii) a price%%stability mechanism which caps revenue increases through tariff rate changes%%for other (noncompetitive) services in any year at the increase in the Gross%%Domestic Product - Price Index in the previous year less 2.25%, and (iii) a%%network deployment schedule which commits to universal broadband availability in%%its telecommunications network by 2015. Hearings on this petition and plan were%%held in February 1994. The PPUC must either approve or reject Bell Atlantic -%%Pennsylvania\\'s plan as filed or suggest changes thereto no later than June 30,%%1994.%%Bell Atlantic - Delaware, Inc. (formerly The Diamond State Telephone Company)%%In August 1992, Bell Atlantic - Delaware filed an intrastate rate case with%%the Delaware Public Service Commission (\"DPSC\") to increase intrastate net%%revenues by $14.3 million annually.  In November 1993, the DPSC voted to award%%Bell Atlantic - Delaware a $3.8 million annual intrastate revenue increase based%%on the stipulated 10.58% overall rate of return.  Bell Atlantic - Delaware then%%filed a petition for reargument of the decision, requesting that the DPSC%%increase Bell Atlantic - Delaware\\'s revenue award by an additional $6.3 million%%annually.  On December 6, 1993, Bell Atlantic - Delaware entered into an%%agreement with the Office of Public Advocate of the Delaware state government%%which stipulated an increase in Bell Atlantic - Delaware\\'s revenue award of $1.5%%million annually.  The DPSC approved the stipulation and ordered a revised%%annual intrastate revenue increase of $5.3 million.  Bell Atlantic - Delaware%%put final rates into effect on December 15, 1993.%%The Delaware Telecommunications Technology Investment Act of 1993 (the%%\"Delaware Telecommunications Act\") became effective on July 8, 1993.  The%%Delaware Telecommunications Act modified telecommunications industry regulation%%for intrastate services and allows Bell Atlantic - Delaware to elect to be%%regulated under an alternative regulation plan instead of traditional rate of%%return regulation.  The Delaware Telecommunications Act provides:%%--   that the prices of \"Basic Telephone Services\" (e.g., dial tone and%%----%%local usage) will remain regulated and cannot change in any one year%%by more than the rate of inflation, less 3%;%%--   that the prices of \"Discretionary Services\" (e.g., Identa Ring(SM)%%----%%and Call Waiting) cannot increase more than 15% per year per service,%%after an initial one-year cap;%%--   that the prices of \"Competitive Services\" (e.g., directory advertising%%----%%and message toll service) will not be subject to tariff; and%%--   that Bell Atlantic - Delaware develop a technology deployment plan%%with a commitment to invest a minimum of $250 million in Delaware\\'s%%telecommunications network during the first five years of the plan.%%12%%The Delaware Telecommunications Act also provides protections to ensure that%%competitors will not be unfairly disadvantaged, including a prohibition on%%cross-subsidization, imputation rules, service unbundling and resale service%%availability requirements, and a review by the DPSC during the fifth year of%%the plan. On July 20 1993, the DPSC initiated a rulemaking to develop%%regulations for the implementation of the Delaware Telecommunications Act.%%On March 24, 1994, Bell Atlantic - Delaware elected to be regulated under the%%alternative regulation provisions of the Delaware Telecommunications Act. On%%such date, Bell Atlantic - Delaware also filed a technology deployment plan%%consistent with such legislation pursuant to which it committed to (i) link%%public schools, major medical facilities and state government offices to the%%\"information superhighway\", (ii) digitize all of its telephone switches by%%1998, and (iii) connect all of its central offices with fiber optic cable by%%1998.%%Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C., Inc. (formerly The Chesapeake and Potomac%%Telephone Company)%%In January 1993, as the outcome of a process begun by a Bell Atlantic -%%Washington, D.C. proposal to the District of Columbia Public Service Commission%%(\"DCPSC\") in 1988, the DCPSC adopted a regulatory reform plan for the intra-%%Washington, D.C. services of Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C. Under the plan,%%the DCPSC adopted a banded rate of return on equity (based on earnings from all%%services) with 12.5% as the midpoint: Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C. would be%%allowed to seek rate increases if its return on equity falls below 11.5% and%%would be required to share, through prospective rate cuts, 50% of any earnings%%in excess of a return on equity of 13.5%. Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C.\\'s%%rates for most residential services were frozen at the levels set in the prior%%rate proceeding in March 1992. The DCPSC granted pricing flexibility, including%%custom contracting and 14-day tariffing, for all Centrex services and for high%%capacity private line services since these services were found to be subject to%%competition. The DCPSC also established a screen for determining what other%%services are competitive and therefore should be subject to flexible pricing in%%the future. The plan will be in effect for three years, after which the DCPSC%%will investigate Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C.\\'s performance and determine%%what regulatory structure is appropriate at that time.%%Pursuant to the DCPSC\\'s January 1993 regulatory reform plan, in December 1993,%%the DCPSC re-set Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C.\\'s banded rate of return on%%equity to range from 10.45% to 12.45%, with a midpoint of 11.45%.  However, the%%DCPSC also found that Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C. was entitled to increased%%annual revenues of $15.8 million.  The DCPSC increased the rates for public%%telephone service, increased the message unit rate for business customers and%%increased certain other business and residential rates to cover the increased%%revenue requirement.  Rates for basic residential service remain frozen at the%%level set in March 1992.  Under the plan, Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C. also%%applied for and received pricing flexibility for several competitive services,%%including digital data services, paging services, speed calling, Repeat Call,%%Home Intercom and Home Intercom Extra.%%13%%Bell Atlantic - Maryland, Inc. (formerly The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone%%Company of Maryland)%%As the result of a process initiated by a joint petition of Bell Atlantic -%%Maryland, the Office of People\\'s Counsel of the Maryland state government, and%%the Staff of the Public Service Commission of Maryland (\"MPSC\"), the MPSC in%%1990 approved an agreement which instituted a regulatory reform plan (the%%\"Reform Plan\") for regulation of intrastate services provided by Bell Atlantic -%%Maryland.  The Reform Plan provides for sharing of earnings on other-than-%%competitive services (e.g., basic business and residential dial tone line and%%----%%usage, pay telephone services and intraLATA toll services) within a prescribed%%rate-of-return range (12.7% to 14.5% return on equity), for the direct refund to%%ratepayers of all earnings above that range and for no sharing of earnings if%%earnings fall below that range.  Earnings on competitive services (e.g., Centrex%%----%%intercom and high capacity, special access and private line services) are not%%subject to a rate of return limitation.  In connection with its approval of the%%Reform Plan, the MPSC required Bell Atlantic - Maryland to initiate a rate%%proceeding to examine Bell Atlantic - Maryland\\'s financial and operating results%%under the Reform Plan and to serve as a rate case for determining rates and rate%%structure on a going-forward basis for services that the MPSC has determined are%%other-than-competitive.%%On January 22, 1993, at the conclusion of this rate proceeding, the MPSC%%issued an order directing Bell Atlantic - Maryland to reduce rates prospectively%%in the aggregate amount of $28.6 million annually.  Tariffs reducing rates by%%that amount became effective on January 23, 1993.  Bell Atlantic - Maryland\\'s%%application for a modification or rehearing of the order was denied in part and%%granted in part on March 30, 1993.  Under the terms of the revised order, Bell%%Atlantic - Maryland\\'s rate reduction was upheld, but it was permitted to%%accelerate the amortization of certain post-employment benefits obligations,%%eliminating any refund requirement for prior periods.  The decision in this case%%is now final.%%On July 26, 1993, MFS-Intelenet of Maryland, Inc. (\"MFS-Maryland\"), a%%subsidiary of MFS Communications Company, Inc. (\"MFS\"), filed an application%%with the MPSC for authority to provide and resell local exchange and%%interexchange telecommunications services to business customers in areas served%%by Bell Atlantic - Maryland and for an order establishing policies and%%requirements for interconnection of competing local exchange networks.  Hearings%%have been held and a final decision is expected in April 1994.%%On November 9, 1993, the MPSC instituted an investigation into legal and%%policy matters relevant to the regulation of firms, including current%%telecommunications providers and cable television firms, which may provide local%%exchange and exchange access services in Maryland in the future.  A procedural%%schedule has been established and a final decision is expected this year.%%Bell Atlantic - Virginia, Inc. (formerly The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone%%Company of Virginia)%%In December 1988, the Virginia State Corporation Commission (\"VSCC\") adopted%%an Experimental Plan for Alternative Regulation (the \"Experimental Plan\") of%%Virginia telephone companies. Bell Atlantic - Virginia elected to participate%%in the Experimental Plan effective January 1, 1989, and remained subject to it%%through the end of 1993. The Experimental Plan marked a departure from%%traditional regulation and classified services into four categories: actually%%competitive, potentially competitive, discretionary and basic. Combined%%earnings from potentially competitive, discretionary and basic services were%%capped at a 14% return on equity.%%Bell Atlantic - Virginia\\'s financial results under the Experimental Plan for%%the years 1989 through 1992 have been filed with the VSCC. The VSCC\\'s audit of%%Bell Atlantic - Virginia\\'s 1989 and 1990 financial results found no refunds to%%be due. Bell Atlantic - Virginia\\'s financial results for 1991 and 1992, which%%as filed with the VSCC indicate that no refunds are due, are still subject to%%VSCC audit.%%14%%Following an evaluation of the Experimental Plan in 1993, the VSCC issued an%%order on December 17, 1993 adopting a Modified Plan for Alternative Regulation%%(the \"Modified Plan\").  The Modified Plan became effective January 1, 1994.%%Bell Atlantic - Virginia is deemed by the VSCC to be subject to this Modified%%Plan.%%The Modified Plan places Bell Atlantic - Virginia\\'s services into one of three%%categories:%%- \"Competitive\" services, for which there are readily available substitutes%%which reasonably meet customer needs and for which competition in the%%marketplace effectively regulates the price (e.g., Centrex intercom services,%%----%%directory advertising).%%- \"Discretionary\" services, which can only be provided by the local%%exchange telephone company, but which are optional, nonessential enhancements to%%basic communications services or services which others are capable of%%providing but which do not conform to the competitive services definition%%(e.g., Caller ID and operator call completion services).%%----%%- \"Basic\" services, which are not discretionary and, due to their nature or%%legal/regulatory restraints, only the local exchange telephone companies can%%provide (e.g., residential and business local exchange telephone service and%%----%%operator directory assistance service).%%The latter two categories of services are subject to rate of return%%regulation.  For 1994 the VSCC has established a permissible range for return on%%equity for these two regulated services of 10.55% to 12.55%.  In assessing%%whether earnings have exceeded this permitted range, the VSCC will impute to%%regulated earnings an amount equal to 25% of the net profits of Yellow Pages%%advertising, which the VSCC will otherwise continue to treat as a competitive%%service under the Modified Plan.  If Bell Atlantic - Virginia\\'s earnings on this%%basis exceed the permitted range, refunds of the excess must be made.  If Bell%%Atlantic - Virginia were to seek an increase in rates for Basic service that,%%taking into account rate changes in Discretionary services, results in an%%increase in overall regulated operating revenue, the financial performance%%considered by the VSCC would include results for all categories of services.%%Earnings from Competitive services are not otherwise regulated.%%In its Final Order of December 17, 1993, the VSCC also announced its intention%%to hold a proceeding in the first half of 1994 to consider further modifications%%to the Modified Plan or alternative regulatory plans that local exchange%%companies might offer.  Under legislation passed in the 1993 session of the%%Virginia General Assembly, the VSCC is no longer statutorily required to%%regulate telephone companies on the basis of rate of return regulation; for%%example, the VSCC is free to adopt a price cap form of regulation.  On February%%8, 1994, Bell Atlantic - Virginia filed a proposal in this new proceeding to%%have its Discretionary and Basic services regulated on a price cap basis;%%competitive services would not be regulated.  Bell Atlantic - Virginia\\'s%%proposal will be discussed in hearings to begin in late April 1994.%%Bell Atlantic - West Virginia, Inc. (formerly The Chesapeake and Potomac%%Telephone Company of West Virginia)%%In April 1988, the Public Service Commission of West Virginia (\"WVPSC\")%%approved a stipulation among Bell Atlantic - West Virginia, AT&T, MCI%%Communications Corporation (\"MCI\"), Sprint Communications Company, L.P.%%(\"Sprint\"), the WVPSC Staff and the Consumer Advocate Division of the WVPSC%%which gave Bell Atlantic - West Virginia flexibility in the pricing of%%competitive services (e.g., intraLATA toll service, intraLATA \"800\" service,%%----%%intraLATA WATS service, billing and collection services and directory%%advertising) and provided for a freeze on rates for basic local exchange%%services through December 31, 1990 and a lifting, on January 1, 1989, of the%%moratorium on intraLATA toll competition.  This \"Flexible Regulation Plan\" was%%subsequently extended through December 31, 1991.  As part of the stipulation,%%Bell Atlantic - West Virginia invested in excess of $300 million dollars from%%1988 through 1990 to modernize West Virginia\\'s telecommunications%%infrastructure.%%15%%In March 1990, the West Virginia legislature enacted legislation, which became%%effective on January 1, 1991, requiring the WVPSC to cease its regulation of the%%rates charged by a telephone utility for any service that the WVPSC finds to be%%subject to \"workable competition\", unless the WVPSC finds that to do so would%%adversely affect the continued availability of adequate, economical and reliable%%local telephone service.%%In December 1991, the WVPSC approved, with some modifications, a stipulation%%signed by Bell Atlantic - West Virginia, the Consumer Advocate Division of the%%WVPSC, the WVPSC Staff and AT&T which set forth a new \"Incentive Regulation%%Plan\".  The Incentive Regulation Plan continues the major provisions of the%%Flexible Regulation Plan, including pricing flexibility for competitive services%%and a freeze on the rates for basic local exchange service.  It also committed%%Bell Atlantic - West Virginia to invest an additional $450 million from 1991%%through 1995 in West Virginia\\'s telecommunications infrastructure.  The%%Incentive Regulation Plan permitted Bell Atlantic - West Virginia to increase%%operator directory assistance and Call Waiting charges, provides Bell Atlantic -%%West Virginia some flexibility in setting depreciation rates and allows Bell%%Atlantic - West Virginia to petition for a surcharge to reflect changes in%%federally mandated separations procedures and accounting rules.  The stipulation%%also provides for the phased elimination of Locality Rate Area charges, which%%are basic service charges paid by customers who are located farthest from the%%central office.  Under the WVPSC\\'s December 1991 order, the freeze on rates for%%basic service and the phase out of Locality Rate Area charges will end on%%December 31, 1994 instead of the July 1, 1996 date set forth in the stipulation.%%In January 1989, AT&T, MCI and Sprint filed petitions with the WVPSC to%%require Bell Atlantic - West Virginia to reduce intrastate access charges by $3%%million annually.  On June 29, 1993, the WVPSC approved a settlement agreement%%in which the parties agreed that access charges would be reduced by $1.5 million%%annually, that the interexchange carriers would not seek additional reductions%%until the year 2000 and that Bell Atlantic - West Virginia would not seek%%additional increases until the year 2000.%%New Products and Services%%Bell Atlantic(R) IQ(SM) Services%%All of the Network Services Companies have introduced the Bell Atlantic(R)%%IQ(SM) Services family of calling features (although not all features are%%available in all states).  These features include Identa Ring(SM), which%%-----------%%allows a single line to have multiple telephone numbers, each with a distinctive%%ring; Repeat Call, which allows customers automatically to redial busy phone%%-----------%%numbers; Return Call, which allows customers automatically to return the last%%-----------%%incoming call, even without knowing the number; Ultra Forward(SM), which%%-------------%%customers can use to program call-forwarding instructions; and Home Intercom,%%-------------%%which allows for phone-to-phone dialing within the home.  All of the Network%%Services Companies except Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania offer Caller ID service,%%---------%%a Bell Atlantic IQ(SM) Service which displays the number of the calling party.%%It is anticipated that Caller ID will be tariffed and available in Pennsylvania%%in 1994.  At the end of 1993, the Network Services Companies had over 600,000%%subscribers to Caller ID.%%Data Services%%The Network Services Companies have introduced several high speed data%%transmission services.  In 1993, Switched Multi-Megabit Data Service (\"SMDS\", a%%-----------------------------------%%high-speed, public, packet-switched data transmission service) was available%%under tariff from all Network Services Companies except Bell Atlantic - New%%Jersey (which offers SMDS on a special rate authorization basis with informal%%approval of the NJBRC) and Bell Atlantic - Delaware; Fiber Distributed Data%%----------------------%%Interface Network Service was available under tariff in Washington, D.C.,%%- -------------------------%%Maryland and Virginia; and Frame Relay Service (which allows high-speed%%-------------------%%interconnection of a customer\\'s multiple locations) was available under tariff%%in Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.%%16%%Information Services%%The Network Services Companies offer various types of information services,%%such as message storage services, voice mail and electronic mail.  Answer Call,%%-----------%%a telephone answering service aimed at residential and small business customers,%%had more than 900,000 subscribers at the end of 1993.%%Competition%%Regulatory proceedings, as well as new technology, are continuing to expand%%the types of available communications services and equipment and the number of%%competitors offering such services.  An increasing amount of this competition is%%from large companies which have substantial capital, technological and marketing%%resources, many of which do not face the same regulatory constraints as the%%Company.%%Alternative Access and Local Services%%A substantial portion of the Network Services Companies\\' revenues from%%business and government customers is derived from a relatively small number of%%large, multiple-line subscribers.%%The Network Services Companies face competition from alternative%%communications systems, constructed by large end users, interexchange carriers%%and alternative access vendors, which are capable of originating and/or%%terminating calls without the use of the local telephone company\\'s plant.  MFS%%has an optical fiber network which currently competes with Bell Atlantic -%%Pennsylvania and Bell Atlantic - Maryland in the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and%%Baltimore metropolitan areas.  In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area,%%Institutional Communications Company, in which MFS has acquired a controlling%%interest, has deployed an optical fiber network to compete with Bell Atlantic -%%Washington, D.C., Bell Atlantic - Maryland and Bell Atlantic - Virginia in the%%provision of switched and special access services and local services.  Eastern%%TeleLogic Corporation is currently providing service in the Philadelphia area%%over an optical fiber network, and Digital Direct of Pittsburgh, Inc. (dba Penn%%Access) has multiple fiber rings in service in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area,%%with additional fiber rings under construction.  In July 1993, Virginia Metrotel%%Inc. was granted authority by the VSCC to compete against Bell Atlantic -%%Virginia in the provision of access services in the Richmond metropolitan area.%%Teleport Communications Group Inc. (\"Teleport\") provides competitive access%%service in the New York metropolitan area, including northern New Jersey.  The%%ability of such alternative access providers to compete with the Network%%Services Companies has been enhanced by the FCC\\'s orders requiring the%%Network Services Companies to offer collocated interconnection for special and%%switched access services.%%Other potential sources of competition are cable television systems, shared%%tenant services and other non-carrier systems which are capable of bypassing the%%Network Services Companies\\' local plant, either partially or completely, through%%substitution of special access for switched access or through concentration of%%telecommunications traffic on fewer of the Network Services Companies\\' lines.%%Well-financed competitors are seeking authority, or are likely soon to seek%%authority, to offer competing local exchange services, such as dial tone and%%local usage, in some of the most lucrative of the local telephone service areas%%of the Network Services Companies.  Southwestern Bell Corporation (\"Southwestern%%Bell\") acquired existing cable television systems in Montgomery County, Maryland%%and Arlington, Virginia.  Southwestern Bell could use these systems to compete%%with the Company\\'s telephone services in these areas.  Southwestern Bell also%%provides cellular service in the Washington metropolitan area.%%17%%On July 26, 1993, MFS-Maryland filed an application with the MPSC for%%authority to provide and resell local exchange and interexchange%%telecommunications services to business customers in areas served by Bell%%Atlantic - Maryland and for an order establishing policies and requirements for%%interconnection of competing local exchange networks.  Hearings have been held%%and a final decision is expected in April 1994.  On November 9, 1993, the MPSC%%instituted an investigation into legal and policy matters relevant to the%%regulation of firms, including current telecommunications providers and cable%%television firms, which may provide local exchange and exchange access services%%in Maryland in the future.  A procedural schedule has been established and a%%final decision is expected this year.%%On December 10, 1993, another MFS subsidiary asked the PPUC for authority to%%provide local exchange service to business customers in certain areas of Bell%%Atlantic - Pennsylvania\\'s service territory.  No procedural schedule has been%%set for action on this petition.%%Teleport and MFS both offer local exchange service in metropolitan New York%%and may seek to extend that service into northern New Jersey.%%The two largest long-distance carriers are also positioning themselves to%%begin to offer services that will compete with the Network Services Companies\\'%%local exchange services.  In November 1992, AT&T announced its intention to%%acquire a controlling interest in McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. (\"McCaw\"),%%the largest cellular company in the United States, and to integrate McCaw\\'s%%wireless local service network with AT&T\\'s long distance network.  In December%%1993, MCI announced its intention to invest $2 billion to begin building%%competing local exchange and access networks in twenty major markets in the%%United States, several of which are likely to be in the Territory. In March%%1994, MCI also announced its intention to acquire a substantial interest in%%Nextel Communications Inc. (formerly Fleet Call Inc.), and to integrate%%Nextel\\'s wireless local service network with MCI\\'s long distance network in at%%least 10 major markets, one or more of which might be in the Territory.%%The entry of these and other local exchange service competitors will almost%%certainly reduce the local exchange service revenues of the Network Services%%Companies, at least in the market segments and geographical areas in which the%%competitors operate.  Depending on such competitors\\' success in marketing their%%services, and the conditions of interconnection established by the regulatory%%commissions, these reductions could be significant.  These revenue reductions%%may be offset to some extent by revenues from interconnection charges to be paid%%to the Network Services Companies by these competitors.%%The Network Services Companies seek to meet such competition by establishing%%and/or maintaining competitive cost-based prices for local exchange services (to%%the extent the FCC and state regulatory authorities permit the Network Services%%Companies\\' prices to move toward costs), by keeping service quality high and by%%effectively implementing advances in technology.  See \"Communications and%%Related Services - The Network Services Companies - FCC Regulation and%%Interstate Rates - Interstate Access Charges\" and \"- FCC Access Charge Pooling%%Arrangements\".%%Personal Communications Services%%Radio-based personal communications services (\"PCS\") also constitute potential%%sources of competition to the Network Services Companies and to Bell Atlantic\\'s%%cellular communications companies.  PCS consists of wireless portable telephone%%services which would allow customers to make and receive telephone calls from%%any location using small handsets, and which could also be used for data%%transmission.  The FCC has authorized trials of such services, using a variety%%of technologies, by numerous companies, including the Company\\'s cellular%%telecommunications subsidiaries (collectively, \"Bell Atlantic Mobile\").%%18%%In September 1993, the FCC issued a report and order allocating radio spectrum%%to be licensed for use in providing PCS.  Under the order, seven separate%%bandwidths of spectrum, ranging in size from 10 MHz to 30 MHz, would be%%auctioned to potential PCS providers in each geographic area of the United%%States; five of the spectrum blocks would be auctioned by \"basic trading area\"%%and the remaining two would be auctioned by larger \"major trading area\" (as such%%trading areas are defined by Rand McNally).  LECs and companies with LEC%%subsidiaries, such as the Company, are eligible to bid for PCS licenses, except%%that cellular carriers such as the Company are limited to obtaining only 10 MHz%%of PCS bandwidth in areas where they provide cellular service.  Bidders other%%than cellular providers may obtain multiple licenses aggregating up to 40 MHz of%%bandwidth in any area.  Bell Atlantic has stated that it intends to pursue PCS%%licenses in the auctions, which are expected to be held in 1994 or in early%%1995.%%In December 1993, the FCC awarded pioneer\\'s preference PCS licenses to, among%%other entities, American Personal Communications (\"APC\"), which is owned in part%%by The Washington Post Company, and Omnipoint Communications, Inc.%%(\"Omnipoint\").  APC\\'s license authorizes it to provide PCS service in%%competition with the local exchange services of the Network Services Companies%%in all or large portions of Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, Maryland,%%Virginia and West Virginia.  APC has announced its intention to build out an%%operational system by the first quarter of 1995.  Omnipoint\\'s license authorizes%%it to provide service in the New York metropolitan area, which includes the%%northern New Jersey areas served by the Company.%%If implemented, PCS and other similar services would compete with services%%currently offered by the Company, and could result in losses of revenues,%%although the Company may be able to derive new revenues if it obtains%%authorization to provide PCS or similar new services.%%Centrex%%The Network Services Companies offer Centrex service, which is a telephone%%company central office-based communications system for business, government and%%other institutional customers consisting of a variety of integrated software-%%based features located in a centralized switch or switches and extended to the%%customer\\'s premises primarily via local distribution facilities.  In the%%provision of Centrex, the Network Services Companies are subject to significant%%competition from the providers of CPE systems, such as private branch exchanges%%(\"PBXs\"), which perform similar functions with less use of the Network Services%%Companies\\' switching facilities.%%Users of Centrex systems generally require more subscriber lines than users of%%PBX systems of similar capacity.  The FCC increased the maximum Subscriber Line%%Charge on embedded Centrex lines to $6.00 per month per line effective April 1,%%1989.  Increases in Subscriber Line Charges result in Centrex users incurring%%higher charges than users of comparable PBX systems.  Some of the state%%regulatory commissions having jurisdiction over the Network Services Companies%%have approved Centrex tariff revisions designed to offset the effects of such%%higher Subscriber Line Charges and to provide for stability of Centrex rates.%%The MPSC established a proceeding to consider the tariff for Centrex Extend%%service (multi-location Centrex intercom service for a closed end user group of%%a single Centrex customer), which Bell Atlantic - Maryland began offering in%%August 1993.  A decision on the appropriateness of this tariff is expected this%%year.  In Virginia and West Virginia, the intercom portion of Centrex service%%has been detariffed.%%19%%IntraLATA Toll Competition%%The ability of interexchange carriers to engage in the provision of intrastate%%intraLATA toll service in competition with the Network Services Companies is%%subject to state regulation.  Such competition is permitted in Pennsylvania,%%Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia; in addition, in Delaware, the DPSC has%%initiated a proceeding to determine whether to require presubscription and%%dialing parity (\"1+ dialing\") for intraLATA toll competitors of Bell Atlantic -%%Delaware.  Intrastate intraLATA competition has not been permitted in New%%Jersey, but the NJBRC has initiated a proceeding in response to petitions filed%%by interexchange carriers to consider whether and on what terms to permit%%intraLATA competition.  The issue is inapplicable to Washington, D.C. since%%intraLATA toll service is not offered within the District of Columbia.  The VSCC%%has instituted a proceeding to consider whether, and on what terms, to permit%%intraLATA competition in Virginia.%%Directories%%The Network Services Companies continue to face significant competition from%%other providers of directories as well as competition from other advertising%%media.  In particular, the former sales representative of the Network Services%%Companies (other than Bell Atlantic - New Jersey) publishes directories in%%competition with those published by the Network Services Companies in New%%Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore%%metropolitan areas.%%Public Telephone Services%%The Company faces increasing competition in the provision of pay telephone%%services from other pay telephone service providers.  In addition, the growth of%%wireless communications negatively impacts usage of public telephones.%%Operator Services%%Alternative operator services providers have entered into competition with the%%Company\\'s operator services product line.%%Other Communications and Related Services%%Domestic Wireless Communications%%Bell Atlantic Mobile provides cellular telecommunications service in certain%%portions of the Network Services Companies\\' Territory and in other parts of the%%United States.  These entities market cellular telecommunications service and%%related equipment directly to consumers, wholesale such service to businesses%%which resell the service to consumers, and authorize agents to sell such service%%to consumers.  They also resell paging service in some locations.  On April 30,%%1992, the Company acquired Metro Mobile CTS, Inc., then the second-largest%%independent provider of cellular telecommunications service in the United%%States.%%Cellular telecommunications service is subject to FCC regulation and licensing%%requirements.  Some states also regulate the service.  To assure competition,%%the FCC awarded two competitive licenses in each market.  Many such competing%%cellular providers are substantial businesses with experience in broadcasting,%%telecommunications, cable television and radio common carrier services.%%Competition is based on the price of cellular service, the quality of the%%service and the size of the geographic area served.  The FCC is in the process%%of authorizing additional providers of mobile services which will likely provide%%competition to existing cellular carriers.  See \"Communications and Related%%Services - The Network Services Companies - Competition - Personal%%Communications Services\".%%20%%Bell Atlantic Mobile has established cellular telecommunications service in%%the standard metropolitan statistical areas (\"SMSAs\") for Washington, D.C.;%%Wilmington, Delaware; Baltimore, Maryland; Allentown, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh%%and Reading, Pennsylvania; Trenton, Vineland and Atlantic City, New Jersey;%%Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona; Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, and New London,%%Connecticut; New Bedford, Pittsfield and Springfield, Massachusetts; Albuquerque%%and Las Cruces, New Mexico; Charlotte and Hickory, North Carolina; Providence,%%Rhode Island; Anderson, Columbia and Greenville, South Carolina; and El Paso,%%Texas.%%Bell Atlantic Mobile also has established service in the rural service areas%%of Kent (Dover), Delaware; Kent (Eastern Shore) and Frederick, Maryland; Ocean,%%Sussex and Hunterdon, New Jersey; Greene, Jefferson, Huntingdon, Lawrence and%%McKean, Pennsylvania; Madison, Caroline, Frederick (Fauquier) and Lee, Virginia;%%Wetzel and Mason, West Virginia; Windham, Connecticut; Cabarrus and Anson, North%%Carolina; Newport, Rhode Island; Cherokee, Lancaster and Oconee, South Carolina;%%and Gila, Arizona.%%Bell Atlantic Mobile also owns a significant minority interest in a%%partnership providing cellular telecommunications service in the New York City%%metropolitan area and the adjoining SMSAs of New Brunswick and Long Branch, New%%Jersey.  Under reciprocal agreements between Bell Atlantic Mobile and certain%%other providers of cellular telecommunications service, the customers of Bell%%Atlantic Mobile may use the services of those other providers in areas where%%Bell Atlantic Mobile is not licensed to provide service.%%Bell Atlantic Paging, Inc. markets paging services in portions of the Network%%Services Companies\\' Territory.%%International%%Bell Atlantic International, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"International\") serve%%as the Company\\'s principal vehicle for new business development outside the%%United States.  International provides telecommunications consulting and%%software systems integration services to telecommunications authorities in%%several countries, and has entered into business development agreements with%%various governmental authorities.%%In September 1990, wholly-owned New Zealand subsidiaries of International and%%Ameritech Corporation (\"Ameritech\") each purchased approximately 49% of the%%common shares of Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Limited (\"TCNZ\") for a%%purchase price of approximately $2.4 billion.  Under the terms of the%%acquisition and subsequent agreements with the New Zealand government,%%International and Ameritech were required to sell equity interests in TCNZ such%%that their combined ownership would, within four years of the acquisition, be%%reduced to 49.9%.  In furtherance of that requirement, International and%%Ameritech in 1991 sold a portion of their equity shares in TCNZ in a worldwide%%public offering, thereby reducing their combined ownership in TCNZ to%%approximately 68%.  In March 1993 and September 1993, International privately%%sold an aggregate of 9.8% of TCNZ, reducing its ownership interest in TCNZ to%%approximately 24.8%, and, together with private sales by Ameritech, completing%%its sell-down obligations.%%International is also a shareholder in joint ventures, begun in November 1990,%%with a subsidiary of U S WEST, INC. and the telecommunications administrations%%of The Czech Republic and The Slovak Republic, to build and operate cellular and%%packet data networks in these republics. The cellular telecommunications%%system currently provides service to the public in, among other cities,%%Prague, Bratislava and Brno.%%In May 1991, International acquired, through a joint venture, approximately a%%12.5% interest in Sky Network Television Limited, a provider of subscription%%television services in New Zealand.%%21%%International, through a joint venture established in December 1992 with%%Societa Finanziaria Telefonica p.a. and Societa Italiana per L\\'Esercizio delle%%Telecomunicazioni p.a., develops operations support systems for%%telecommunications providers worldwide.%%In November 1993, International acquired for $520 million approximately 23% of%%the equity ownership interest in Grupo Iusacell, S.A. de C.V. (\"Iusacell\"), the%%second largest telecommunications company in Mexico and the primary business of%%which is the provision of cellular telephone service.  Under the acquisition%%agreement, and provided certain conditions are met, International is obligated%%to purchase additional shares of Iusacell\\'s capital stock representing 17%-23%%%of Iusacell\\'s total outstanding shares of capital stock for up to an additional%%$520 million.%%In March 1994, a consortium in which International has the second largest%%interest (approximately 11.5%), was awarded the second cellular license for%%Italy.%%Business Systems Companies%%Bell Atlantic Business Systems Services, Inc. (\"Business Systems Services\"),%%which was formerly known as Sorbus Inc., is a computer services company which%%provides hardware and software maintenance, network support, disaster recovery%%and other services for more than 5,000 makes and models of computer equipment%%and associated peripherals.  Business Systems Services provides service to more%%than 60,000 customer sites from over 200 locations in the United States and%%Canada.  Business Systems Services\\' major competitors are computer equipment%%manufacturers which offer to service the equipment they sell as well as other%%vendors of computer maintenance and service.  In some cases, Business Systems%%Services is dependent on computer manufacturers and distributors for spare parts%%necessary for the products it services.%%The Bell Atlantic Computer Technology Services Division of Business Systems%%Services provides parts repair and sales and refurbishment services for%%International Business Machines Corporation, Digital Equipment Corporation, Sun%%Microsystems, Inc. and other computer manufacturers\\' equipment to end users,%%manufacturers and service companies throughout the world.%%Bell Atlantic Business Systems International, Inc. provides computer%%maintenance and other end user computer services in the United Kingdom, France,%%Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, The Netherlands and Finland through%%companies which are owned jointly with International Computers Limited.%%Business Systems International provides computer services in Australia and New%%Zealand through a partnership with Fujitsu Australia Limited.%%Other%%Bell Atlantic TeleProducts Corp. sells CPE to residential, work-at-home and%%small business customers and Integrated Services Digital Network CPE to a%%variety of business customers.%%Bell Atlantic Professional Services, Inc. recruits and contracts out temporary%%professional services and provides training services to suppliers and end users%%of computers and communications equipment.%%During 1993 the Company began to exit the customized software and systems%%businesses operated by subsidiaries of The Bell Atlantic Systems Group, Inc.%%The Company has sold the stock or substantially all the assets of Bell Atlantic%%Utilities Systems, Inc., Bell Atlantic Public Sector Systems, Inc. and Bell%%Atlantic Integrated Systems, Inc., and is pursuing the sale of Bell Atlantic%%Healthcare Systems, Inc. The Company continues to operate the operations%%support systems software business of Bell Atlantic Telecommunications Systems,%%Inc. as a subsidiary of International and the network integration business of%%Bell Atlantic Integrated Systems, Inc. through the Large Business Services%%LOB.%%22%%FINANCIAL, REAL ESTATE, AND OTHER SERVICES%%The Financial, Real Estate, and Other Services segment comprises Bell Atlantic%%Capital Corporation (\"Capital Corporation\") and its subsidiaries, Bell Atlantic%%Properties, Inc. (\"Properties\") and its subsidiaries, and Vision Energy%%Resources, Inc. (\"Vision Energy\") and its subsidiaries.  In line with its%%continuing de-emphasis of financial services businesses over the past several%%years and its intensified focus on core communications businesses, the Company%%announced in October 1993 that it had begun evaluating possible strategies for%%exiting its financial services businesses.%%Capital Corporation\\'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Bell Atlantic TriCon Leasing%%Corporation (\"TriCon\"), engages in leasing of office, medical and other%%equipment sold by many vendors and also provides other types of financing.  In%%addition, TriCon provides leasing of CPE to customers of other Bell Atlantic%%companies, and engages in a number of large leveraged leasing transactions.  In%%March 1994, the Company announced an agreement to sell substantially all of%%Tricon\\'s assets (other than its leveraged lease and project finance portfolios)%%to GFC Financial Corporation.  This sale is expected to close in the second%%quarter of 1994, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals.%%In 1992, Capital Corporation entered into a joint venture agreement with%%PacifiCorp Financial Services, Inc. (\"PFS\") with respect to both companies\\'%%computer leasing businesses.  Prior to the formation of the joint venture,%%Capital Corporation\\'s computer leasing business was operated by its subsidiary,%%Bell Atlantic Systems Leasing International, Inc. (\"BASLI\").  Under the joint%%venture, Capital Corporation and PFS established Pacific Atlantic Systems%%Leasing, Inc. (\"PASLI\"), 50% owned by each of the companies, which both%%companies use as their principal vehicle for domestic operating leases of%%computer equipment.  Most of BASLI\\'s employees have become employees of PASLI,%%and PASLI is responsible for the day-to-day management of BASLI\\'s domestic%%computer leasing portfolio.%%The equipment financing market is highly competitive.  Equipment financing%%companies must compete with substantial leasing companies which are affiliated%%with major equipment suppliers, and with other well established leasing%%companies, banks and other financial institutions.%%Properties invests in and manages commercial real estate properties.%%The Vision Energy companies are engaged in the sale and distribution of%%liquefied petroleum gas primarily in the midwestern United States and Florida.%%CERTAIN CONTRACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS%%Certain planning, marketing, procurement, financial, legal, accounting,%%technical support and other management services are provided on behalf of the%%Network Services Companies on a centralized basis by Bell Atlantic\\'s wholly-%%owned subsidiary, Bell Atlantic Network Services, Inc. (\"NSI\").  Bell Atlantic%%Network Funding Corporation provides short-term financing and cash management%%services to the Network Services Companies.%%Certain corporate services also are provided to other subsidiaries on a%%centralized basis by NSI.  Bell Atlantic Financial Services, Inc. provides%%short-, medium- and long-term financing services and cash management services to%%subsidiaries of the Company other than the Network Services Companies.%%23%%The seven RHCs each own (directly or through subsidiaries) a one-seventh%%interest in Bell Communications Research, Inc.

Pursuant to the%%Plan, Bellcore furnishes the RHCs and their BOC subsidiaries with technical%%assistance such as network planning, engineering and software development, as%%well as various other consulting services that can be provided more effectively%%on a centralized basis.  Bellcore is the central point of contact for%%coordinating the efforts of the RHCs in meeting the national security and%%emergency preparedness requirements of the federal government.  It also helps to%%mobilize the combined resources of the RHCs in times of natural disasters.%%EMPLOYEE RELATIONS%%As of December 31, 1993, the Company and its subsidiaries employed%%approximately 73,600 persons, which represents approximately a three percent%%increase from the number of employees at December 31, 1992.  This overall net%%increase reflects growth in certain non-Network Services Companies subsidiaries,%%the acquisition in 1993 of two companies which provide advertising and marketing%%services through the Directory Services LOB, and the hiring of some associates%%by the Network Services Companies to meet service requirements.%%Approximately 65% of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are%%represented by unions.  Of those so represented, approximately 80% are%%represented by the Communications Workers of America, and approximately 20% are%%represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which are%%both affiliated with the American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial%%Organizations.%%Under the terms of the three-year contracts ratified in October 1992 by unions%%representing associate employees of the Network Services Companies and NSI,%%represented associates received a base wage increase of 3.74% in August 1993.%%Under the same contracts, associates received a Corporate Profit Sharing payment%%of $495 per person in 1994 based upon the Company\\'s 1993 financial performance.%%24%%Item 2.

At December 31, 1993, the Company\\'s%%investment in plant, property and equipment consisted of the following:%%Communications and Related Services:%%Connecting lines...............                          38%%%Central office equipment.......                          37%%Land and buildings.............                           7%%Telephone instruments and related%%equipment...............                           2%%Other..........................                          14%%Financial, Real Estate, and Other Services                     2%%---%%100%%%===%%\"Connecting lines\" consists primarily of aerial cable, underground cable,%%poles, conduit and wiring.  \"Central office equipment\" consists of switching%%equipment, transmission equipment and related facilities.  \"Land and buildings\"%%consists of land owned in fee and improvements thereto, principally central%%office buildings.  \"Telephone instruments and related equipment\" consists%%primarily of public telephone instruments and telephone equipment (including%%PBXs) used by the Network Services Companies in their operations.  \"Other\"%%property consists primarily of furniture, office equipment, vehicles and other%%work equipment, and plant under construction of the Network Services Companies,%%as well as the property of the Other Communications and Related Services%%companies.  Financial, Real Estate, and Other Services property consists mainly%%of land and buildings owned by BAP.  Not included in the above properties is%%$199.3 million of equipment under operating leases, net of accumulated%%depreciation of $652.4 million, owned primarily by TriCon and BASLI at December%%31, 1993.  Additional information with respect to the Company\\'s plant, property%%and equipment is set forth in Schedule V on page F-4 of this report.%%The Company\\'s central offices are served by various types of switching%%equipment.  At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the number of local exchanges served%%and the percent of subscriber lines served by each type of equipment were as%%follows:%%1993                         1992%%---------------------------  ---------------------------%%# of Local  % of Subscriber  # of Local  % of Subscriber%%Exchanges    Lines Served    Exchanges    Lines Served%%---------   ---------------  ----------  ---------------%%Digital.....       2,755         62.9           2,587          59.0%%Analog......       1,419         37.0           1,499          40.8%%Other.......           8          0.1              10           0.2%%-----         ----           -----          ----%%4,182          100           4,096           100%%=====         ====           =====          ====%%25%%Item 3.  Legal Proceedings%%Pre-Divestiture Contingent Liabilities and Litigation%%The Plan provides for the recognition and payment by AT&T and the former BOCs%%(including the Network Services Companies) of liabilities that are attributable%%to pre-Divestiture events but do not become certain until after Divestiture.%%These contingent liabilities relate principally to litigation and other claims%%with respect to the former Bell System\\'s rates, taxes, contracts and torts%%(including business torts, such as alleged violations of the antitrust laws).%%Except to the extent that affected parties otherwise agree, contingent%%liabilities that are attributable to pre-Divestiture events are shared by AT&T%%and the BOCs in accordance with formulas prescribed by the Plan, whether or not%%an entity was a party to the proceeding and regardless of whether an entity was%%dismissed from the proceeding by virtue of settlement or otherwise.  Each%%company\\'s allocable share of liability under these formulas depends on several%%factors, including the type of contingent liability involved and each company\\'s%%relative net investment as of the effective date of Divestiture.  Under the%%formula generally applicable to most of the categories of these contingent%%liabilities, the Network Services Companies\\' aggregate allocable share of%%liability is approximately 10.2%.%%AT&T and various of its subsidiaries and the BOCs (including in some cases one%%or more of the Network Services Companies) have been and are parties to various%%types of litigation relating to pre-Divestiture events, including actions and%%proceedings involving environmental claims and allegations of violations of%%equal employment laws.  Damages, if any, ultimately awarded in the remaining%%actions relating to pre-Divestiture events could have a financial impact on the%%Company whether or not the Company is a defendant since such damages will be%%treated as contingent liabilities and allocated in accordance with the%%allocation rules established by the Plan.%%While complete assurance cannot be given as to the outcome of any contingent%%liabilities or litigation, in the opinion of the Company\\'s management, any%%monetary liability or financial impact to which the Company would be subject%%after final adjudication of all of the remaining potential or actual pre-%%Divestiture claims would not be material in amount to the financial position%%of the Company.%%Other Pending Cases%%(1)  On April 12, 1990, a letter was submitted to the Company\\'s Board of%%Directors by a law firm, purportedly on behalf of a shareowner of the Company,%%requesting that the Company commence action against any present or former%%director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries who%%might be found to have violated any duty to the Company in connection with (i)%%certain litigation involving Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania and (ii) a temporary%%suspension of the Company and Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C. from eligibility%%for future federal government contracts (the \"Treasury suspension\").  As%%previously reported by the Company in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the%%quarters ended March 31 and September 30, 1990 and its Annual Reports on Form%%10-K for the years ended December 31, 1990 and 1991, the Bell Atlantic -%%Pennsylvania litigation involved allegations that this subsidiary had engaged in%%improper practices while selling certain optional services, and resulted in a%%settlement pursuant to which Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania made payments and%%refunds aggregating approximately $42 million; the Treasury suspension involved%%allegations that the Company and Bell Atlantic - Washington, D.C. had%%misrepresented certain facts in connection with a bid for a particular%%government contract, and was terminated approximately one month later after the%%Company agreed to re-emphasize to employees the need to verify information%%provided to the government, including information supplied to the Company by%%sub-contractors.%%26%%In response to the demand letter (a similar letter, purportedly on behalf of%%a different shareowner, was received shortly thereafter), the Board of Directors%%of the Company (the \"Board) on April 24, 1990 appointed a committee of three%%outside directors (James H. Gilliam, Jr. (Chairman), William G. Copeland and%%John F. Maypole) to investigate these matters and present its recommendation to%%the Board (the \"Special Committee\").%%On May 11, 1990, the Company was served with a complaint filed in the Court of%%Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, naming certain then-current%%directors and officers as defendants in a shareholder derivative suit.  The%%complaint alleged that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties to the%%Company and its shareowners by failing to implement and enforce adequate%%safeguards to prevent the activities which resulted in the Bell Atlantic -%%Pennsylvania litigation and the Treasury suspension referred to above.  The%%Company is not a defendant in this litigation.%%The Special Committee retained independent outside counsel and conducted a%%five-month investigation.  After completion of its investigation, the Special%%Committee concluded that it would not be in the best interest of the Company and%%its shareowners to assert claims or take any other action against any director%%or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to either the%%Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania litigation or the Treasury suspension.%%Accordingly, the Special Committee recommended that the Board reject the demands%%expressed in the shareowner letters, and the Board on October 23, 1990 adopted%%this recommendation.  Counsel for each of the demanding shareowners was advised%%of the Board\\'s determination.%%The defendants\\' motion to dismiss the Court of Common Pleas litigation on%%jurisdictional grounds was denied and, as reported in the Company\\'s Quarterly%%Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1991, in September 1991%%the Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to hear the defendants\\' appeal of the%%trial court\\'s denial of their motion to dismiss the Court of Common Pleas%%litigation.%%A related case filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern%%District of Pennsylvania was settled and is discussed below under \"Prior%%Cases.\"%%(2)  In its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 1990%%and 1991, the Company reported that in January 1991, the Company, its Chief%%Executive Officer and its former Chief Financial Officer were named as%%defendants in several identical class action complaints.  These complaints,%%which have been consolidated in a single proceeding in the United States%%District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and have subsequently%%been amended, allege that, during a class period from June 14, 1990 through%%January 22, 1991, the plaintiffs purchased shares of Bell Atlantic stock at%%inflated prices as a result of the defendants\\' alleged failure to disclose%%material information regarding certain aspects of the Company\\'s financial%%performance and prospects.  The trial court\\'s earlier decision granting%%defendants\\' motion to dismiss this action has been reversed by the United States%%Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upon appeal by the plaintiffs.  Discovery%%in this action is in progress.%%While complete assurance cannot be given as to the outcome of any litigation,%%in the opinion of the Company\\'s management, any monetary liability or financial%%impact to which the Company would be subject after final adjudication of the%%foregoing actions would not be material in amount to the financial position of%%the Company.%%Prior Cases%%On June 19, 1991, the Company was served with a complaint filed in the United%%States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania naming all of%%the then-current directors of the Company and one former officer as defendants%%in a shareowner class action and derivative suit. This lawsuit made%%allegations very similar to the Court of Common Pleas suit referenced above in%%\"Other Pending Cases\" with respect to the Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania%%litigation and Treasury suspension matters and, in addition, alleged that the%%Company violated federal proxy rules and regulations and its duty of candor%%under state law by failing to disclose, in its 1987-1991 proxy materials,%%information about the Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania litigation, the Treasury%%suspension, the appointment of the Special Committee and the Court of Common%%Pleas litigation referenced above.%%27%%On March 25, 1992, the parties to the federal court action reached an%%agreement to settle that action, subject to court approval after notice to the%%Company\\'s shareowners, without the payment of any damages but subject to payment%%of the plaintiffs\\' attorneys fees up to $450,000.  In June 1992, this settlement%%agreement was approved by the United States District Court for the Eastern%%District of Pennsylvania.  A single shareowner, who is also the plaintiff in the%%related Court of Common Pleas litigation, filed an appeal with the United States%%Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit challenging the approval of the%%settlement agreement by the lower court.  On August 18, 1993, the Third%%Circuit affirmed the lower court approval of the settlement agreement.  After%%expiration of the time in which to file an appeal of the Third Circuit%%affirmation, the Company paid the plaintiffs\\' attorneys fees stipulated by the%%settlement agreement and the federal court action was dismissed.%%Item 4.

The remaining life method provides for the full%%recovery of the remaining net investment in plant, property and equipment.%%During 1993, 1992, and 1991, the telephone subsidiaries implemented changes%%in depreciation rates approved by the regulators.

Albertini (the%%\"Executive\").%%WHEREAS, competitive initiatives are vital to the success of the business%%of BAC and to each business entity, whether a corporation, partnership or other%%type of entity, in which, from time to time, BAC owns directly or indirectly a%%majority economic or voting interest (BAC and such majority-owned entities are%%collectively referred to herein as \"Bell Atlantic Companies\"); and%%WHEREAS, the Human Resources Committee (the \"HRC\") of the Board of%%Directors of BAC determined on November 22, 1993, that it is appropriate for BAC%%and other Bell Atlantic Companies to enter into agreements with certain officers%%for the following purposes:  (1) to assist in retaining the services of said%%officers throughout a crucial period during which Bell Atlantic expects to%%conclude a major corporate merger and otherwise accelerate the transformation of%%its business; (2) to obtain protection for BAC and other affected Bell Atlantic%%Companies in the form of non-compete and proprietary information covenants from%%said officers;and (3) in consideration for said covenants, to provide for%%severance benefits that any such officer may become eligible to receive under%%certain circumstances; and%%NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, including compensation%%and benefits recited below, the Executive and BAC hereby agree as follows:%%1.  Term of this Agreement:%%----------------------%%This Agreement shall be effective on and after the date first stated above%%and shall expire either on the second anniversary of the date of the first%%closing of the transactions contemplated by a letter of intent dated October 12,%%1993, among BAC, Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media, Inc., or on%%December 31, 1995, in the absence of any such closing prior to that date;%%provided, however, that in the event that the Executive\\'s employment terminates%%on or before said expiration date, this Agreement shall continue in force so%%long as rights and obligations of the respective parties hereunder remain in%%force by their terms.%%2.  Certain Involuntary Terminations of Employment.%%----------------------------------------------%%(a)  Consequences of Certain Involuntary Terminations.  In the event that%%------------------------------------------------%%the Bell Atlantic Company that then employs the Executive involuntarily%%terminates the Executive\\'s employment for a reason other than \"misconduct\" (as%%defined in Section%%1%%7), then BAC shall provide a cash separation benefit to the Executive in an%%amount equal (before applicable withholding taxes) to three times the sum of:%%(A) the Executive\\'s annual rate of base recurring salary at the time of%%termination of employment; and (B) the greater of (i) the value of the%%Executive\\'s most recent award of cash and deferred stock under the Senior%%Management Short Term Incentive Plan (the \"STIP\"), or (ii) the value of the most%%recent award of cash and deferred stock under the STIP for the Executive\\'s%%salary grade without taking into account any individual performance adjustments%%to the award.  This cash separation benefit shall be payable in one installment,%%which shall be payable not later than 60 days after the termination of%%employment date, subject to the Executive\\'s continuing compliance with the terms%%of this Agreement.%%(b)  For purposes of Section 2(a), a termination of employment will be%%treated as involuntary, even if the termination is characterized for other%%purposes as voluntary, if, either:%%(i)  BAC acknowledges in a writing delivered to the Executive that the%%termination is considered to be involuntary for purposes of this%%Section; or%%(ii) the termination of employment is under duress.  An otherwise voluntary%%termination of employment will be considered involuntary, and \"under%%duress\", for purposes of this Section 2 of this Agreement, if, in the%%absence of misconduct on the part of the Executive, and without the%%Executive\\'s express written consent, any of the following events has%%occurred within 12 months prior to the Executive\\'s termination of%%employment: (A) the Executive\\'s status as a \"Senior Manager\" has been%%revoked; (B) the Executive\\'s base recurring salary has been reduced by%%more than 10%; (C) the Executive has suffered a negative individual%%performance adjustment which causes the Executive\\'s short term award%%under the STIP for a particular year to be reduced by 25% or more; or%%(D) the Executive\\'s responsibilities have been substantially reduced%%in type or scope, other than in a general reorganization of the%%management functions of one or more Bell Atlantic Companies, with the%%result that the Executive has materially less status and authority.%%3.   Certain Voluntary Terminations of Employment.%%--------------------------------------------%%(a)  Consequences of Certain Voluntary Terminations.  In the event that the%%----------------------------------------------%%Executive voluntarily resigns or voluntarily retires, other than under%%circumstances that are treated as involuntary for purposes of Section 2 hereof,%%then the Chairman shall elect either:%%(i)  to pay the cash separation benefit described in Section 2(a), and, in%%that event, the payment by the Bell Atlantic Company of the amount%%stated in Section 2(a) shall be the Executive\\'s exclusive remedy for%%any cause of action asserted by, or any damages alleged to be suffered%%by, the%%2%%Executive in connection with his employment with, or termination of%%employment from, any Bell Atlantic Company;%%(ii) to waive the obligation of the Executive to comply with the covenants%%of Section 4 (but not Section 5) of this Agreement from and after the%%date of termination; provided, however, that the parties acknowledge%%that, in the event of any such waiver, the benefit-forfeiture%%provisions of the Bell Atlantic Senior Management Retirement Income%%Plan (the \"RIP\") and the Bell Atlantic Performance Share Plan (the%%\"PSP\") shall nevertheless remain applicable to the Executive, in%%accordance with the terms of those plans, as they may be amended from%%time to time.%%(b)  Misconduct.  The Executive shall have no rights under this Section 3%%----------%%if BAC determines that there was misconduct by the Executive at or about the%%time of the Executive\\'s voluntary resignation or retirement.%%4.   Prohibition Against Competitive Activities:%%------------------------------------------%%(a)  Prohibited Conduct by the Executive:  During the period of the%%-----------------------------------%%Executive\\'s employment with any Bell Atlantic Company, and for a period of two%%years following the Executive\\'s retirement or termination of employment for any%%other reason from any and all Bell Atlantic Companies, the Executive, without%%the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of BAC, shall not:%%(i)  personally engage in \"Competitive Activities\" (as defined in paragraph%%4(b)) within any geographic area in which any Bell Atlantic Company is%%then engaged (or, at the time of the Executive\\'s termination of%%employment, had a board-approved business plan under which it planned%%to engage) in Competitive Activities;%%(ii) work for, own, manage, operate, control or participate in the%%ownership, management, operation or control of, or provide consulting%%or advisory services to, any individual, partnership, firm,%%corporation or institution engaged in Competitive Activities within%%any geographic area described in Section 4(a)(i); provided, however,%%that the Executive\\'s purchase or holding, for investment purposes, of%%securities of a publicly-traded company shall not constitute%%\"ownership\" or \"participation in ownership\" for purposes of this%%paragraph so long as the Executive\\'s equity interest in any such%%company is less than a controlling interest;%%(iii) interfere with the relationship of any Bell Atlantic Company with any%%of its employees, agents, representatives, suppliers or vendors under%%contract, or joint venturers, where any such person or entity%%cooperates with or supports a Bell Atlantic Company in its%%performance of any Competitive Activities; or%%3%%(iv) directly or indirectly attempt to divert from any Bell Atlantic%%Company any business in connection with Competitive Activities.%%(b)  Competitive Activities:  For purposes of Section 4(a) hereof,%%----------------------%%\"Competitive Activities\" means business activities relating to products or%%services of the same or similar type as those for which the Executive had%%responsibility to plan, develop, manage or oversee within the last 24 months of%%the Executive\\'s employment with any Bell Atlantic Company.%%(c)    Notice.  BAC shall send the Executive written notice in the event%%------%%that BAC believes that the Executive has violated any of the prohibitions of%%this Section 4; provided, however, that any failure by BAC to give notice under%%this provision or to enforce its rights under this Agreement in any one or more%%instances shall not be a bar to BAC giving notice and taking action to enforce%%its rights under this Agreement at any later time.%%(d)  Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive acknowledges that the%%----------------------%%Executive\\'s violation of any of the prohibitions of this Section 4 or the rules%%against wrongful competitive activity by the Executive as defined under the RIP%%and the PSP, as the terms of those plans may be amended from time to time, may%%result in the Executive\\'s forfeiture of any and all rights to benefits or awards%%under the RIP and the PSP.%%5.   Prohibition Against Disclosure of Proprietary Information:%%---------------------------------------------------------%%(a)  Prohibited Conduct by the Executive:  The Executive acknowledges that,%%-----------------------------------%%as one of the most senior officers of the Bell Atlantic Companies, the Executive%%has continuing access to confidential and proprietary information of Bell%%Atlantic Companies.  The Executive shall, therefore, at all times during the%%period of active employment with any Bell Atlantic Company, and for a period of%%three years thereafter, preserve the confidentiality of all proprietary%%information of any Bell Atlantic Company.  The three-year limitation under this%%paragraph shall not in any way limit any Bell Atlantic Company\\'s common law and%%statutory rights to protect its trade secrets or intellectual property rights at%%any time, to the full extent of the law. \"Proprietary information\" includes,%%but is not limited to, information in the possession or control of a Bell%%Atlantic Company that has not been fully disclosed in a writing which has been%%generally circulated to the public at large, and which gives the Bell Atlantic%%Company an opportunity to obtain or maintain advantages over its current and%%potential competitors, such as:%%-    strategic or tactical business plans, and undisclosed financial data;%%-    ideas, processes, methods, techniques, systems, patented or%%copyrighted information, models, devices, programs, computer software%%or related information;%%-    documents relating to regulatory matters and correspondence with%%governmental entities;%%-    pricing and cost data;%%-    reports and analyses of business prospects;%%4%%-    business transactions which are contemplated or planned;%%-    research data;%%-    personnel information and data;%%-    identities of users and purchasers of any Bell Atlantic Company\\'s%%products or services; and%%-    other confidential matters pertaining to or known by one or more Bell%%Atlantic Companies, including confidential information of a third%%party which a Bell Atlantic Company is bound to protect.%%(b)  Obligation to Return Company Property:  If and when the Executive%%-------------------------------------%%retires or terminates employment for any other reason with all Bell Atlantic%%Companies, the Executive shall, prior to the last day of active employment and%%without charge to any Bell Atlantic Company, return to the employing Bell%%Atlantic Company (or the rightful Bell Atlantic Company) all company property,%%including, without limitation, originals and copies of records, papers,%%programs, computer software, documents and other materials which contain%%Proprietary Information, as defined in Section 5(a).  The Executive shall%%thereafter cooperate with each applicable Bell Atlantic Company in executing and%%delivering documents requested by the company that are necessary to assist the%%Bell Atlantic Company in patenting or registering any programs, ideas,%%inventions, discoveries, copyright material or trademarks, and to vest title%%thereto in the Bell Atlantic Company.%%(c)  Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive acknowledges that the%%----------------------%%Executive\\'s violation of the prohibitions of this Section 5, or other%%\"misconduct\" by the Executive (as that term is interpreted by the HRC under the%%RIP and PSP plans, as those plans may be amended from time to time), may result%%in the Executive\\'s forfeiture of any and all rights to benefits or awards under%%the RIP and the PSP.%%6.   Remedies in Addition to Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive%%----------------------------------------------%%recognizes that irreparable injury will result to one or more Bell Atlantic%%Companies, and to the business and property of any of them, in the event of a%%breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of Section 5 or 6 of this%%Agreement, and that the Executive\\'s continued employment is predicated on the%%commitments made by the Executive in those Sections.  In the event of any breach%%of any of the Executive\\'s commitments under Section 5 or 6, any Bell Atlantic%%Company that is damaged by such breach shall be entitled, in addition to%%declaring a forfeiture of benefits as described herein, and in addition to any%%other remedies and damages available, to injunctive relief to restrain the%%violation of such commitments by the Executive or by any person or persons%%acting for or with the Executive in any capacity whatsoever.%%7.   Misconduct.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"misconduct\"%%----------%%shall mean a violation of law (other than a traffic violation or other minor%%civil offense), or behavior that BAC concludes amounts to a material breach of%%any company policy or provision of the Employee Code of Business Conduct, and%%including, by way of example: dishonesty; working outside the Bell Atlantic%%Companies in competition with any Bell Atlantic Company; other conduct that%%poses a material conflict of interest; revealing confidential or proprietary%%information of any%%5%%Bell Atlantic Company; or a substantial and deliberate abuse of the voucher or%%expense reimbursement processes of any Bell Atlantic Company.%%8.   Miscellaneous Provisions.%%------------------------%%(a)  Legal Release:  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,%%-------------%%no cash separation benefit under Section 2 or 3 hereof shall be payable unless%%and until the Executive signs a legal release in a form satisfactory to BAC;%%provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement is intended to cause the%%Executive to waive his right to submit claims for employee benefits in%%accordance with the terms of any employee benefit plans in which the Executive%%remains a participant.%%(b)  Assignment by the Company:  BAC may assign this Agreement without the%%-------------------------%%Executive\\'s consent to any company that acquires all or substantially all of the%%assets of BAC, or into which or with which BAC is merged or consolidated.  If%%and when the Executive transfers to a Bell Atlantic Company other than the%%current employing Bell Atlantic Company, this Agreement shall be deemed to be%%automatically assigned to that company; provided, however, that, in the event of%%any such transfer, BAC shall continue to be a party to this Agreement.  This%%Agreement may not be assigned by the Executive.%%(c)  Waiver:  The waiver by any Bell Atlantic Company of a breach by the%%------%%Executive of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver%%of any subsequent breach by the Executive.%%(d)  Severability:  If any clause, phrase or provision of this Agreement,%%------------%%or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid or%%unenforceable under any applicable law, such event shall not affect or render%%invalid or unenforceable the remainder of this Agreement and shall not affect%%the application of any clause, phrase or provision hereof to other persons or%%circumstances.  Furthermore, in the event that a court of law or equity%%determines that the geographic scope of the covenants under Section 4, or the%%duration of any of the restrictions under this Agreement, are not enforceable,%%this Agreement shall hereby be deemed to be amended to the extent necessary, but%%only to the extent necessary, to permit the enforcement of the terms of this%%Agreement.%%(e)  Governing Law:  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in%%-------------%%accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.%%(f)  Entire Agreement:  Except for the terms and conditions of the%%----------------%%compensation and benefit plans applicable to the Executive (as such plans may be%%amended by the applicable Bell Atlantic Company from time to time), this%%Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of BAC and the Executive and%%supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements, and communications, whether oral%%or written, pertaining to the subject matter hereof; and this Agreement shall%%not be modified or amended except by written agreement of the Executive, BAC and%%the Bell Atlantic Company which then employs the Executive.%%6%%IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on the%%date first set forth above.%%BELL ATLANTIC CORPORATION%%By:%%--------------------------------%%Raymond W.

The Executive%%----------------------------------------------%%recognizes that irreparable injury will result to one or more Bell Atlantic%%Companies, and to the business and property of any of them, in the event of a%%breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of Section 5 or 6 of this%%Agreement, and that the Executive\\'s continued employment is predicated on the%%commitments made by the Executive in those Sections.  In the event of any breach%%of any of the Executive\\'s commitments under Section 5 or 6, any Bell Atlantic%%Company that is damaged by such breach shall be entitled, in addition to%%declaring a forfeiture of benefits as described herein, and in addition to any%%other remedies and damages available, to injunctive relief to restrain the%%violation of such commitments by the Executive or by any person or persons%%acting for or with the Executive in any capacity whatsoever.%%7.   Misconduct.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"misconduct\"%%----------%%shall mean a violation of law (other than a traffic violation or other minor%%civil offense), or behavior that BAC concludes amounts to a material breach of%%any company policy or provision of the Employee Code of Business Conduct, and%%including, by way of example: dishonesty; working outside the Bell Atlantic%%Companies in competition with any Bell Atlantic Company; other conduct that%%poses a material conflict of interest; revealing confidential or proprietary%%information of any%%5%%Bell Atlantic Company; or a substantial and deliberate abuse of the voucher or%%expense reimbursement processes of any Bell Atlantic Company.%%8.   Miscellaneous Provisions.%%------------------------%%(a)  Legal Release:  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,%%-------------%%no cash separation benefit under Section 2 or 3 hereof shall be payable unless%%and until the Executive signs a legal release in a form satisfactory to BAC;%%provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement is intended to cause the%%Executive to waive his right to submit claims for employee benefits in%%accordance with the terms of any employee benefit plans in which the Executive%%remains a participant.%%(b)  Assignment by the Company:  BAC and the Employing Company may assign%%-------------------------%%this Agreement without the Executive\\'s consent to any company that acquires all%%or substantially all of the assets of BAC, or into which or with which BAC or%%the Employing Company is merged or consolidated.  If and when the Executive%%transfers to a Bell Atlantic Company other than the current employing Bell%%Atlantic Company, this Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically assigned to%%that company; provided, however, that, in the event of any such transfer, BAC%%shall continue to be a party to this Agreement.  This Agreement may not be%%assigned by the Executive.%%(c)  Waiver:  The waiver by any Bell Atlantic Company of a breach by the%%------%%Executive of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver%%of any subsequent breach by the Executive.%%(d)  Severability:  If any clause, phrase or provision of this Agreement,%%------------%%or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid or%%unenforceable under any applicable law, such event shall not affect or render%%invalid or unenforceable the remainder of this Agreement and shall not affect%%the application of any clause, phrase or provision hereof to other persons or%%circumstances.  Furthermore, in the event that a court of law or equity%%determines that the geographic scope of the covenants under Section 4, or the%%duration of any of the restrictions under this Agreement, are not enforceable,%%this Agreement shall hereby be deemed to be amended to the extent necessary, but%%only to the extent necessary, to permit the enforcement of the terms of this%%Agreement.%%(e)  Governing Law:  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in%%-------------%%accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.%%(f)  Entire Agreement:  Except for the terms and conditions of the%%----------------%%compensation and benefit plans applicable to the Executive (as such plans may be%%amended by the applicable Bell Atlantic Company from time to time), this%%Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of BAC, the Employing Company and%%the Executive and supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements, and%%communications, whether oral or written, pertaining to the subject matter%%hereof; and this Agreement shall not be modified or amended except by written%%agreement of the Executive, BAC and the Bell Atlantic Company which then employs%%the Executive.%%6%%IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on the%%date first set forth above.%%BELL ATLANTIC CORPORATION%%By:%%---------------------------------%%Raymond W.

(\"Iusacell\"), this Committee wishes to provide recognition to%%Lawrence T. Babbio, Jr., who, as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer%%of Bell Atlantic Enterprises International, Inc. was instrumental to that%%business development, and to provide additional incentives to that officer%%conditioned on an initial public offering of Iusacell securities and growth in%%the value of said securities;%%RESOLVED, that this Committee hereby grants to said officer a number of%%nonqualified stock options (\"Options\") to purchase American Depositary Receipts%%(\"ADRs\") representing a number of Series L shares of common stock of Iusacell%%(\"Shares\"), in the amount presented to this meeting; provided, however, that the%%number of Options, and the exercise price stated in paragraph \"1\" of these%%resolutions, shall be adjusted to reflect splits and reverse splits in the%%Shares from time to time, and to reflect the number of Shares corresponding to%%one ADR; and it is%%FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Options shall be subject to certain terms and%%conditions, which are to be stated in detail in a Stock Option Agreement between%%the Corporation and the optionee, and which shall include the following%%principles:%%1.  The exercise price for each Option shall be equal to the cost per%%Iusacell share to Bell Atlantic, which is US$25.296 per Share, prior to%%adjustment in the manner previously described in these resolutions.%%2.  The Options shall be exercisable exclusively in cash, and the optionee%%shall therefore not be entitled to receive reload options upon exercising the%%Options.%%3.  The term of the Options shall be 10 years, except to the extent the%%Options are canceled earlier upon a termination of the optionee\\'s employment for%%any reason other than retirement, disability or death.%%4.  Unless the Options expire or are canceled earlier, as described in%%paragraph \"3\", Options shall first become exercisable as follows:%%a. as to half of the optionee\\'s Options, the first date on which the%%ADRs have traded for 30 successive trading days on a major US stock%%exchange at or above 125% of the Option exercise price (after adjustment%%----%%for splits and conversion to ADRs); and%%b.   as to the other half of the optionee\\'s Options, the%%first date on which the ADRs have traded for 30 successive%%trading days on a major US stock exchange at or above 150% of%%----%%the Option exercise price (after adjustment for splits and%%conversion to ADRs).%%5.   The optionee\\'s \"retirement\" or termination of employment on account of%%\"disability\" (as those terms are defined in the Stock Option Plan) shall not, in%%and of itself, cause the cancellation or early expiration of the Options, nor%%shall it accelerate the date or which any Option may be exercised.  The%%optionee\\'s Options shall expire not later than the first anniversary of the date%%of the optionee\\'s death, whether or not any or all of the Options shall have%%become exercisable on or before said anniversary date.%%FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Assistant Vice President - Compensation and Benefits%%is hereby authorized, with the advice and assistance of counsel, to take such%%further action as he deems necessary or appropriate to implement these%%resolutions, including, without limitation, to prepare and enter into the Stock%%Option Agreement contemplated by these resolutions.%%EX-10.T%%8%%EXHIBIT 10T%%Exhibit 10t%%-----------%%EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT%%THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, made this 24th day of January, 1994, by and%%between Bell Atlantic Corporation (\"BAC\") and James G. Cullen (the \"Executive\").%%WHEREAS, competitive initiatives are vital to the success of the business%%of BAC and to each business entity, whether a corporation, partnership or other%%type of entity, in which, from time to time, BAC owns directly or indirectly a%%majority economic or voting interest (BAC and such majority-owned entities are%%collectively referred to herein as \"Bell Atlantic Companies\"); and%%WHEREAS, the Human Resources Committee (the \"HRC\") of the Board of%%Directors of BAC determined on November 22, 1993, that it is appropriate for BAC%%and other Bell Atlantic Companies to enter into agreements with certain officers%%for the following purposes:  (1) to assist in retaining the services of said%%officers throughout a crucial period during which Bell Atlantic expects to%%conclude a major corporate merger and otherwise accelerate the transformation of%%its business; (2) to obtain protection for BAC and other affected Bell Atlantic%%Companies in the form of non-compete and proprietary information covenants from%%said officers;and (3) in consideration for said covenants, to provide for%%severance benefits that any such officer may become eligible to receive under%%certain circumstances; and%%WHEREAS, BAC and the Executive entered into a Non-Compete and Proprietary%%Information Agreement, dated August 10, 1993 (the \"1993 Agreement\"), and the%%parties wish to enter into this Agreement for the purpose of supplanting the%%terms of the 1993 Agreement unless and until this Agreement expires while the%%Executive remains actively employed, in which case the 1993 Agreement shall once%%again become applicable;%%NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, including compensation%%and benefits recited below, the Executive and BAC hereby agree as follows:%%1.  Term of this Agreement:%%----------------------%%This Agreement shall be effective on and after the date first stated above%%and shall expire either on the second anniversary of the date of the first%%closing of the transactions contemplated by a letter of intent dated October 12,%%1993, among BAC, Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media, Inc., or on%%December 31, 1995, in the absence of any such closing prior to that date;%%provided, however, that in the event that the Executive\\'s employment terminates%%on or before said expiration date, this Agreement shall continue in force so%%long as rights and obligations of the respective parties hereunder remain in%%force by their terms.  In the event that the Executive%%1%%remains actively employed, either by BAC or by any other company that is then a%%Bell Atlantic Company, past the date on which this Agreement actually expires,%%as described in the first sentence of this paragraph, then the 1993 Agreement%%shall again be given full force and effect; provided, however, that, unless and%%until such event occurs, the 1993 Agreement shall be deemed to be superseded by%%this Agreement.%%2.  Certain Involuntary Terminations of Employment.%%----------------------------------------------%%(a)  Consequences of Certain Involuntary Terminations.  In the event that%%------------------------------------------------%%the Bell Atlantic Company that then employs the Executive involuntarily%%terminates the Executive\\'s employment for a reason other than \"misconduct\" (as%%defined in Section 7), then BAC shall provide a cash separation benefit to the%%Executive in an amount equal (before applicable withholding taxes) to three%%times the sum of:  (A) the Executive\\'s annual rate of base recurring salary at%%the time of termination of employment; and (B) the greater of (i) the value of%%the Executive\\'s most recent award of cash and deferred stock under the Senior%%Management Short Term Incentive Plan (the \"STIP\"), or (ii) the value of the most%%recent award of cash and deferred stock under the STIP for the Executive\\'s%%salary grade without taking into account any individual performance adjustments%%to the award.  This cash separation benefit shall be payable in one installment,%%which shall be payable not later than 60 days after the termination of%%employment date, subject to the Executive\\'s continuing compliance with the terms%%of this Agreement.%%(b)  For purposes of Section 2(a), a termination of employment will be%%treated as involuntary, even if the termination is characterized for other%%purposes as voluntary, if, either:%%(i)  BAC acknowledges in a writing delivered to the Executive that the%%termination is considered to be involuntary for purposes of this%%Section; or%%(ii) the termination of employment is under duress.  An otherwise voluntary%%termination of employment will be considered involuntary, and \"under%%duress\", for purposes of this Section 2 of this Agreement, if, in the%%absence of misconduct on the part of the Executive, and without the%%Executive\\'s express written consent, any of the following events has%%occurred within 12 months prior to the Executive\\'s termination of%%employment: (A) the Executive\\'s status as a \"Senior Manager\" has been%%revoked; (B) the Executive\\'s base recurring salary has been reduced by%%more than 10%; (C) the Executive has suffered a negative individual%%performance adjustment which causes the Executive\\'s short term award%%under the STIP for a particular year to be reduced by 25% or more; or%%(D) the Executive\\'s responsibilities have been substantially reduced%%in type or scope, other than in a general reorganization of the%%management functions of one or more Bell Atlantic Companies, with the%%result that the Executive has materially less status and authority.%%2%%3.  Certain Voluntary Terminations of Employment.%%--------------------------------------------%%(a)  Consequences of Certain Voluntary Terminations.  In the event that the%%----------------------------------------------%%Executive voluntarily resigns or voluntarily retires, other than under%%circumstances that are treated as involuntary for purposes of Section 2 hereof,%%then the Chairman shall elect either:%%(i)  to pay the cash separation benefit described in Section 2(a), and, in%%that event, the payment by the Bell Atlantic Company of the amount%%stated in Section 2(a) shall be the Executive\\'s exclusive remedy for%%any cause of action asserted by, or any damages alleged to be suffered%%by, the Executive in connection with his employment with, or%%termination of employment from, any Bell Atlantic Company;%%(ii) to waive the obligation of the Executive to comply with the covenants%%of Section 4 (but not Section 5) of this Agreement from and after the%%date of termination; provided, however, that the parties acknowledge%%that, in the event of any such waiver, the benefit-forfeiture%%provisions of the Bell Atlantic Senior Management Retirement Income%%Plan (the \"RIP\") and the Bell Atlantic Performance Share Plan (the%%\"PSP\") shall nevertheless remain applicable to the Executive, in%%accordance with the terms of those plans, as they may be amended from%%time to time.%%(b)  Misconduct.  The Executive shall have no rights under this Section 3%%----------%%if BAC determines that there was misconduct by the Executive at or about the%%time of the Executive\\'s voluntary resignation or retirement.%%4.   Prohibition Against Competitive Activities:%%------------------------------------------%%(a)  Prohibited Conduct by the Executive:  During the period of the%%-----------------------------------%%Executive\\'s employment with any Bell Atlantic Company, and for a period of two%%years following the Executive\\'s retirement or termination of employment for any%%other reason from any and all Bell Atlantic Companies, the Executive, without%%the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of BAC, shall not:%%(i)  personally engage in \"Competitive Activities\" (as defined in paragraph%%4(b)) within any geographic area in which any Bell Atlantic Company is%%then engaged (or, at the time of the Executive\\'s termination of%%employment, had a board-approved business plan under which it planned%%to engage) in Competitive Activities;%%(ii) work for, own, manage, operate, control or participate in the%%ownership, management, operation or control of, or provide consulting%%or advisory services to, any individual, partnership, firm,%%corporation or institution engaged in Competitive Activities within%%any geographic area described in Section 4(a)(i); provided, however,%%that the Executive\\'s purchase or holding, for investment purposes, of%%securities of a publicly-traded%%3%%company shall not constitute \"ownership\" or \"participation in%%ownership\" for purposes of this paragraph so long as the Executive\\'s%%equity interest in any such company is less than a controlling%%interest;%%(iii) interfere with the relationship of any Bell Atlantic Company with any%%of its employees, agents, representatives, suppliers or vendors under%%contract, or joint venturers, where any such person or entity%%cooperates with or supports a Bell Atlantic Company in its%%performance of any Competitive Activities; or%%(iv) directly or indirectly attempt to divert from any Bell Atlantic%%Company any business in connection with Competitive Activities.%%(b)  Competitive Activities:  For purposes of Section 4(a) hereof,%%----------------------%%\"Competitive Activities\" means business activities relating to products or%%services of the same or similar type as those for which the Executive had%%responsibility to plan, develop, manage or oversee within the last 24 months of%%the Executive\\'s employment with any Bell Atlantic Company.%%(c)  Notice.  BAC shall send the Executive written notice in the event%%------%%that BAC believes that the Executive has violated any of the prohibitions of%%this Section 4; provided, however, that any failure by BAC to give notice under%%this provision or to enforce its rights under this Agreement in any one or more%%instances shall not be a bar to BAC giving notice and taking action to enforce%%its rights under this Agreement at any later time.%%(d)  Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive acknowledges that the%%----------------------%%Executive\\'s violation of any of the prohibitions of this Section 4 or the rules%%against wrongful competitive activity by the Executive as defined under the RIP%%and the PSP, as the terms of those plans may be amended from time to time, may%%result in the Executive\\'s forfeiture of any and all rights to benefits or awards%%under the RIP and the PSP.%%5.   Prohibition Against Disclosure of Proprietary Information:%%---------------------------------------------------------%%(a)  Prohibited Conduct by the Executive:  The Executive acknowledges that,%%-----------------------------------%%as one of the most senior officers of the Bell Atlantic Companies, the Executive%%has continuing access to confidential and proprietary information of Bell%%Atlantic Companies.  The Executive shall, therefore, at all times during the%%period of active employment with any Bell Atlantic Company, and for a period of%%three years thereafter, preserve the confidentiality of all proprietary%%information of any Bell Atlantic Company.  The three-year limitation under this%%paragraph shall not in any way limit any Bell Atlantic Company\\'s common law and%%statutory rights to protect its trade secrets or intellectual property rights at%%any time, to the full extent of the law. \"Proprietary information\" includes,%%but is not limited to, information in the possession or control of a Bell%%Atlantic Company that has not been fully disclosed in a writing which has been%%generally circulated to the public at large, and which gives the Bell Atlantic%%4%%Company an opportunity to obtain or maintain advantages over its current and%%potential competitors, such as:%%-    strategic or tactical business plans, and undisclosed financial data;%%-    ideas, processes, methods, techniques, systems, patented or%%copyrighted information, models, devices, programs, computer software%%or related information;%%-    documents relating to regulatory matters and correspondence with%%governmental entities;%%-    pricing and cost data;%%-    reports and analyses of business prospects;%%-    business transactions which are contemplated or planned;%%-    research data;%%-    personnel information and data;%%-    identities of users and purchasers of any Bell Atlantic Company\\'s%%products or services; and%%-    other confidential matters pertaining to or known by one or more Bell%%Atlantic Companies, including confidential information of a third%%party which a Bell Atlantic Company is bound to protect.%%(b)  Obligation to Return Company Property:  If and when the Executive%%-------------------------------------%%retires or terminates employment for any other reason with all Bell Atlantic%%Companies, the Executive shall, prior to the last day of active employment and%%without charge to any Bell Atlantic Company, return to the employing Bell%%Atlantic Company (or the rightful Bell Atlantic Company) all company property,%%including, without limitation, originals and copies of records, papers,%%programs, computer software, documents and other materials which contain%%Proprietary Information, as defined in Section 5(a).  The Executive shall%%thereafter cooperate with each applicable Bell Atlantic Company in executing and%%delivering documents requested by the company that are necessary to assist the%%Bell Atlantic Company in patenting or registering any programs, ideas,%%inventions, discoveries, copyright material or trademarks, and to vest title%%thereto in the Bell Atlantic Company.%%(c)  Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive acknowledges that the%%----------------------%%Executive\\'s violation of the prohibitions of this Section 5, or other%%\"misconduct\" by the Executive (as that term is interpreted by the HRC under the%%RIP and PSP plans, as those plans may be amended from time to time), may result%%in the Executive\\'s forfeiture of any and all rights to benefits or awards under%%the RIP and the PSP.%%6.   Remedies in Addition to Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive%%----------------------------------------------%%recognizes that irreparable injury will result to one or more Bell Atlantic%%Companies, and to the business and property of any of them, in the event of a%%breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of Section 5 or 6 of this%%Agreement, and that the Executive\\'s continued employment is predicated on the%%commitments made by the Executive in those Sections.  In the event of any breach%%of any of the Executive\\'s commitments under Section 5 or 6, any Bell Atlantic%%Company that is damaged by such breach shall be entitled, in addition to%%declaring a forfeiture of benefits as described herein, and in%%5%%addition to any other remedies and damages available, to injunctive relief to%%restrain the violation of such commitments by the Executive or by any person or%%persons acting for or with the Executive in any capacity whatsoever.%%7.   Misconduct.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"misconduct\"%%----------%%shall mean a violation of law (other than a traffic violation or other minor%%civil offense), or behavior that BAC concludes amounts to a material breach of%%any company policy or provision of the Employee Code of Business Conduct, and%%including, by way of example: dishonesty; working outside the Bell Atlantic%%Companies in competition with any Bell Atlantic Company; other conduct that%%poses a material conflict of interest; revealing confidential or proprietary%%information of any Bell Atlantic Company; or a substantial and deliberate abuse%%of the voucher or expense reimbursement processes of any Bell Atlantic Company.%%8.   Miscellaneous Provisions.%%------------------------%%(a)  Legal Release:  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,%%-------------%%no cash separation benefit under Section 2 or 3 hereof shall be payable unless%%and until the Executive signs a legal release in a form satisfactory to BAC;%%provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement is intended to cause the%%Executive to waive his right to submit claims for employee benefits in%%accordance with the terms of any employee benefit plans in which the Executive%%remains a participant.%%(b)  Assignment by the Company:  BAC may assign this Agreement without the%%-------------------------%%Executive\\'s consent to any company that acquires all or substantially all of the%%assets of BAC, or into which or with which BAC is merged or consolidated.  If%%and when the Executive transfers to a Bell Atlantic Company other than the%%current employing Bell Atlantic Company, this Agreement shall be deemed to be%%automatically assigned to that company; provided, however, that, in the event of%%any such transfer, BAC shall continue to be a party to this Agreement.  This%%Agreement may not be assigned by the Executive.%%(c)  Waiver:  The waiver by any Bell Atlantic Company of a breach by the%%------%%Executive of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver%%of any subsequent breach by the Executive.%%(d)  Severability:  If any clause, phrase or provision of this Agreement,%%------------%%or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid or%%unenforceable under any applicable law, such event shall not affect or render%%invalid or unenforceable the remainder of this Agreement and shall not affect%%the application of any clause, phrase or provision hereof to other persons or%%circumstances.  Furthermore, in the event that a court of law or equity%%determines that the geographic scope of the covenants under Section 4, or the%%duration of any of the restrictions under this Agreement, are not enforceable,%%this Agreement shall hereby be deemed to be amended to the extent necessary, but%%only to the extent necessary, to permit the enforcement of the terms of this%%Agreement.%%6%%(e)  Governing Law:  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in%%-------------%%accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.%%(f)  Entire Agreement:  Except for the terms and conditions of the%%----------------%%compensation and benefit plans applicable to the Executive (as such plans may be%%amended by the applicable Bell Atlantic Company from time to time), and except%%for the potential resumption of the terms of the 1993 Agreement under%%circumstances described in Section 1, this Agreement sets forth the entire%%understanding of BAC and the Executive and supersedes all prior agreements,%%arrangements, and communications, whether oral or written, pertaining to the%%subject matter hereof; and this Agreement shall not be modified or amended%%except by written agreement of the Executive, BAC and the Bell Atlantic Company%%which then employs the Executive.%%IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on the%%date first set forth above.%%BELL ATLANTIC CORPORATION%%By:%%-------------------------------------%%Raymond W.

In the event that%%------------------------------------------------%%the employing Bell Atlantic Company involuntarily terminates the Executive\\'s%%employment for a reason other than misconduct, then BAC shall provide a cash%%separation benefit to the Executive in an amount equal (before applicable%%withholding taxes) to two times the sum of:  (A) the Executive\\'s annual rate of%%base recurring salary at the time of termination of employment; and (B) the%%Executive\\'s most recent award of cash and deferred stock under the Senior%%Management Short Term Incentive Plan.  This cash separation benefit%%4%%shall be payable in monthly installments over a period of 24 months, subject to%%the Executive\\'s continuing compliance with the terms of this Agreement.%%(b)  A termination of employment will be treated as involuntary, even if%%the termination is characterized for other purposes as voluntary, if, either:%%(i)  BAC acknowledges in a writing delivered to the Executive that the%%termination is considered to be involuntary for purposes of this%%Section; or%%(ii) the termination of employment is under duress.  An otherwise voluntary%%termination of employment will be considered involuntary, and \"under%%duress\", for purposes of this Section 5 of this Agreement, if, in the%%absence of misconduct on the part of the Executive, and without the%%Executive\\'s express written consent, any of the following events has%%occurred within 12 months prior to the Executive\\'s termination of%%employment: (A) the Executive\\'s status as a \"Senior Manager\" has been%%revoked; (B) the Executive\\'s base recurring salary has been reduced by%%more than 10%; (C) the Executive has suffered a negative individual%%performance adjustment which causes the Executive\\'s short term award%%under the STIP for a particular year to be reduced by 25% or more; or%%(D) the Executive\\'s responsibilities have been substantially reduced%%in both type and scope, other than in a general reorganization of the%%management functions of one or more Bell Atlantic Companies, with the%%result that the Executive has materially less status and authority.%%6.   Certain Voluntary Terminations of Employment.%%--------------------------------------------%%(a)  Consequences of Certain Voluntary Terminations.  In the event that the%%----------------------------------------------%%Executive voluntarily resigns or voluntarily retires, other than under%%circumstances that are treated as involuntary for purposes of Section 5 hereof,%%then the Chairman shall elect either:%%(i)  to pay the cash installments described in Section 5(a), or%%(ii) to waive the obligation of the Executive to comply with the covenants%%of Section 1 (but not Section 2) of this Agreement from and after the%%date of termination; provided, however, that the parties acknowledge%%that, in the event of any such waiver, the benefit-forfeiture%%provisions of the RIP and the PSP shall nevertheless remain applicable%%to the Executive, in accordance with%%5%%the terms of those plans, as they may be amended from time to time.%%(b)  Misconduct.  The Executive shall have no rights under this Section 6%%----------%%if BAC determines that there was misconduct by the Executive at or about the%%time of the Executive\\'s voluntary resignation or retirement.%%7.   Miscellaneous Provisions.%%------------------------%%(a)  Assignment by the Company:  BAC may assign this Agreement without the%%-------------------------%%Executive\\'s consent to any company that acquires all or substantially all of the%%assets of BAC, or into which or with which BAC is merged or consolidated.  If%%and when the Executive transfers to a Bell Atlantic Company other than the%%current employing Bell Atlantic Company, this Agreement shall be deemed to be%%automatically assigned to that company; provided, however, that, in the event of%%any such transfer, BAC shall continue to be a party to this Agreement.  This%%Agreement may not be assigned by the Executive.%%(b)  Waiver:  The waiver by any Bell Atlantic Company of a breach by the%%------%%Executive of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver%%of any subsequent breach by the Executive.%%(c)  Severability:  If any clause, phrase or provision of this Agreement,%%------------%%or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid or%%unenforceable under any applicable law, such event shall not affect or render%%invalid or unenforceable the remainder of this Agreement and shall not affect%%the application of any clause, phrase or provision hereof to other persons or%%circumstances.  Furthermore, in the event that a court of law or equity%%determines that the geographic scope of the covenants under Section 1, or the%%duration of any of the restrictions under this Agreement, are not enforceable,%%this Agreement shall hereby be deemed to be amended to the extent necessary, but%%only to the extent necessary, to permit the enforcement of the terms of this%%Agreement.%%(d)  Governing Law:  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in%%-------------%%accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.%%(e)  Entire Agreement:  Except for the terms and conditions of the%%----------------%%compensation and benefit plans applicable to the Executive (as such plans may be%%amended by the applicable Bell Atlantic Company from time to time), this%%Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of BAC and the Executive and%%supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements, and communications, whether oral%%or written, pertaining to the subject matter hereof; and this Agreement shall%%6%%not be modified or amended except by written agreement of the Executive, BAC and%%the Bell Atlantic Company which then employs the Executive.%%IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on the%%date first set forth above.%%BELL ATLANTIC CORPORATION%%By:%%-----------------------------------%%Raymond W.

Term of this Agreement:%%----------------------%%This Agreement shall be effective on and after the date first stated above%%and shall expire either on the second anniversary of the date of the first%%closing of the transactions contemplated by a letter of intent dated October 12,%%1993, among BAC, Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media, Inc., or on%%December 31, 1995, in the absence of any such closing prior to that date;%%provided, however, that in the event that the Executive\\'s employment terminates%%on or before said expiration date, this%%1%%Agreement shall continue in force so long as rights and obligations of the%%respective parties hereunder remain in force by their terms.%%2.  Certain Involuntary Terminations of Employment.%%----------------------------------------------%%(a) Consequences of Certain Involuntary Terminations.  In the event that%%------------------------------------------------%%the Bell Atlantic Company that then employs the Executive involuntarily%%terminates the Executive\\'s employment for a reason other than \"misconduct\" (as%%defined in Section 7), then BAC shall provide a cash separation benefit to the%%Executive in an amount equal (before applicable withholding taxes) to three%%times the sum of:  (A) the Executive\\'s annual rate of base recurring salary at%%the time of termination of employment; and (B) the greater of (i) the value of%%the Executive\\'s most recent award of cash and deferred stock under the Senior%%Management Short Term Incentive Plan (the \"STIP\"), or (ii) the value of the most%%recent award of cash and deferred stock under the STIP for the Executive\\'s%%salary grade without taking into account any individual performance adjustments%%to the award.  This cash separation benefit shall be payable in one installment,%%which shall be payable not later than 60 days after the termination of%%employment date, subject to the Executive\\'s continuing compliance with the terms%%of this Agreement.%%(b)  For purposes of Section 2(a), a termination of employment will be%%treated as involuntary, even if the termination is characterized for other%%purposes as voluntary, if, either:%%(i)  BAC acknowledges in a writing delivered to the Executive that the%%termination is considered to be involuntary for purposes of this%%Section; or%%(ii) the termination of employment is under duress.  An otherwise voluntary%%termination of employment will be considered involuntary, and \"under%%duress\", for purposes of this Section 2 of this Agreement, if, in the%%absence of misconduct on the part of the Executive, and without the%%Executive\\'s express written consent, any of the following events has%%occurred within 12 months prior to the Executive\\'s termination of%%employment: (A) the Executive\\'s status as a \"Senior Manager\" has been%%revoked; (B) the Executive\\'s base recurring salary has been reduced by%%more than 10%; (C) the Executive has suffered a negative individual%%performance adjustment which causes the Executive\\'s short term award%%under the STIP for a particular year to be reduced by 25% or more; or%%(D) the Executive\\'s responsibilities have been substantially reduced%%in type or scope, other than in a general reorganization of the%%management functions of one or more Bell Atlantic Companies, with the%%result that the Executive has materially less status and authority.%%2%%3.  Certain Voluntary Terminations of Employment.%%--------------------------------------------%%(a) Consequences of Certain Voluntary Terminations.  In the event that the%%----------------------------------------------%%Executive voluntarily resigns or voluntarily retires, other than under%%circumstances that are treated as involuntary for purposes of Section 2 hereof,%%then the Chairman shall elect either:%%(i)  to pay the cash separation benefit described in Section 2(a), and, in%%that event, the payment by the Bell Atlantic Company of the amount%%stated in Section 2(a) shall be the Executive\\'s exclusive remedy for%%any cause of action asserted by, or any damages alleged to be suffered%%by, the Executive in connection with his employment with, or%%termination of employment from, any Bell Atlantic Company;%%(ii) to waive the obligation of the Executive to comply with the covenants%%of Section 4 (but not Section 5) of this Agreement from and after the%%date of termination; provided, however, that the parties acknowledge%%that, in the event of any such waiver, the benefit-forfeiture%%provisions of the Bell Atlantic Senior Management Retirement Income%%Plan (the \"RIP\") and the Bell Atlantic Performance Share Plan (the%%\"PSP\") shall nevertheless remain applicable to the Executive, in%%accordance with the terms of those plans, as they may be amended from%%time to time.%%(b)  Misconduct.  The Executive shall have no rights under this Section 3%%----------%%if BAC determines that there was misconduct by the Executive at or about the%%time of the Executive\\'s voluntary resignation or retirement.%%4.

The Executive acknowledges that the%%----------------------%%Executive\\'s violation of any of the prohibitions of this Section 4 or the rules%%against wrongful competitive activity by the Executive as defined under the RIP%%and the PSP, as the terms of those plans may be amended from time to time, may%%result in the Executive\\'s forfeiture of any and all rights to benefits or awards%%under the RIP and the PSP.%%5.

The Executive shall, therefore, at all times during the%%period of active employment with any Bell Atlantic Company, and for a period of%%three years thereafter, preserve the confidentiality of all proprietary%%information of any Bell Atlantic Company.  The three-year limitation under this%%paragraph shall not in any way limit any Bell Atlantic Company\\'s common law and%%statutory rights to protect its trade secrets or intellectual property rights at%%any time, to the full extent of the law. \"Proprietary information\" includes,%%but is not limited to, information in the possession or control of a Bell%%Atlantic Company that has not been fully disclosed in a writing which has been%%generally circulated to the public at large, and which gives the Bell Atlantic%%4%%Company an opportunity to obtain or maintain advantages over its current and%%potential competitors, such as:%%-    strategic or tactical business plans, and undisclosed financial data;%%-    ideas, processes, methods, techniques, systems, patented or%%copyrighted information, models, devices, programs, computer software%%or related information;%%-    documents relating to regulatory matters and correspondence with%%governmental entities;%%-    pricing and cost data;%%-    reports and analyses of business prospects;%%-    business transactions which are contemplated or planned;%%-    research data;%%-    personnel information and data;%%-    identities of users and purchasers of any Bell Atlantic Company\\'s%%products or services; and%%-    other confidential matters pertaining to or known by one or more Bell%%Atlantic Companies, including confidential information of a third%%party which a Bell Atlantic Company is bound to protect.%%(b)  Obligation to Return Company Property:  If and when the Executive%%-------------------------------------%%retires or terminates employment for any other reason with all Bell Atlantic%%Companies, the Executive shall, prior to the last day of active employment and%%without charge to any Bell Atlantic Company, return to the employing Bell%%Atlantic Company (or the rightful Bell Atlantic Company) all company property,%%including, without limitation, originals and copies of records, papers,%%programs, computer software, documents and other materials which contain%%Proprietary Information, as defined in Section 5(a).  The Executive shall%%thereafter cooperate with each applicable Bell Atlantic Company in executing and%%delivering documents requested by the company that are necessary to assist the%%Bell Atlantic Company in patenting or registering any programs, ideas,%%inventions, discoveries, copyright material or trademarks, and to vest title%%thereto in the Bell Atlantic Company.%%(c)  Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive acknowledges that the%%----------------------%%Executive\\'s violation of the prohibitions of this Section 5, or other%%\"misconduct\" by the Executive (as that term is interpreted by the HRC under the%%RIP and PSP plans, as those plans may be amended from time to time), may result%%in the Executive\\'s forfeiture of any and all rights to benefits or awards under%%the RIP and the PSP.%%6.   Remedies in Addition to Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive%%----------------------------------------------%%recognizes that irreparable injury will result to one or more Bell Atlantic%%Companies, and to the business and property of any of them, in the event of a%%breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of Section 5 or 6 of this%%Agreement, and that the Executive\\'s continued employment is predicated on the%%commitments made by the Executive in those Sections.  In the event of any breach%%of any of the Executive\\'s commitments under Section 5 or 6, any Bell Atlantic%%Company that is damaged by such breach shall be entitled, in addition to%%declaring a forfeiture of benefits as described herein, and in%%5%%addition to any other remedies and damages available, to injunctive relief to%%restrain the violation of such commitments by the Executive or by any person or%%persons acting for or with the Executive in any capacity whatsoever.%%7.   Misconduct.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"misconduct\"%%----------%%shall mean a violation of law (other than a traffic violation or other minor%%civil offense), or behavior that BAC concludes amounts to a material breach of%%any company policy or provision of the Employee Code of Business Conduct, and%%including, by way of example: dishonesty; working outside the Bell Atlantic%%Companies in competition with any Bell Atlantic Company; other conduct that%%poses a material conflict of interest; revealing confidential or proprietary%%information of any Bell Atlantic Company; or a substantial and deliberate abuse%%of the voucher or expense reimbursement processes of any Bell Atlantic Company.%%8.   Miscellaneous Provisions.%%------------------------%%(a)  Legal Release:  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,%%-------------%%no cash separation benefit under Section 2 or 3 hereof shall be payable unless%%and until the Executive signs a legal release in a form satisfactory to BAC;%%provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement is intended to cause the%%Executive to waive his right to submit claims for employee benefits in%%accordance with the terms of any employee benefit plans in which the Executive%%remains a participant.%%(b)  Assignment by the Company:  BAC and the Employing Company may assign%%-------------------------%%this Agreement without the Executive\\'s consent to any company that acquires all%%or substantially all of the assets of BAC, or into which or with which BAC or%%the Employing Company is merged or consolidated.  If and when the Executive%%transfers to a Bell Atlantic Company other than the current employing Bell%%Atlantic Company, this Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically assigned to%%that company; provided, however, that, in the event of any such transfer, BAC%%shall continue to be a party to this Agreement.  This Agreement may not be%%assigned by the Executive.%%(c)  Waiver:  The waiver by any Bell Atlantic Company of a breach by the%%------%%Executive of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver%%of any subsequent breach by the Executive.%%(d)  Severability:  If any clause, phrase or provision of this Agreement,%%------------%%or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid or%%unenforceable under any applicable law, such event shall not affect or render%%invalid or unenforceable the remainder of this Agreement and shall not affect%%the application of any clause, phrase or provision hereof to other persons or%%circumstances.  Furthermore, in the event that a court of law or equity%%determines that the geographic scope of the covenants under Section 4, or the%%duration of any of the restrictions under this Agreement, are not enforceable,%%this Agreement shall hereby be deemed to be amended to the extent necessary, but%%only to the extent necessary, to permit the enforcement of the terms of this%%Agreement.%%6%%(e)  Governing Law:  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in%%-------------%%accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.%%(f)  Entire Agreement:  Except for the terms and conditions of the%%----------------%%compensation and benefit plans applicable to the Executive (as such plans may be%%amended by the applicable Bell Atlantic Company from time to time), and except%%for the potential resumption of the terms of the 1993 Agreement under%%circumstances described in Section 1, this Agreement sets forth the entire%%understanding of BAC, the Employing Company and the Executive and supersedes all%%prior agreements, arrangements, and communications, whether oral or written,%%pertaining to the subject matter hereof; and this Agreement shall not be%%modified or amended except by written agreement of the Executive, BAC and the%%Bell Atlantic Company which then employs the Executive.%%IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on the%%date first set forth above.%%BELL ATLANTIC CORPORATION%%By:%%--------------------------------%%Raymond W.

Certain Involuntary Terminations of Employment.%%----------------------------------------------%%(a)  Consequences of Certain Involuntary Terminations.  In the event that%%------------------------------------------------%%the employing Bell Atlantic Company involuntarily terminates the Executive\\'s%%employment for a reason other than misconduct, then BAC shall provide a cash%%separation benefit to the Executive in an amount equal (before applicable%%withholding taxes) to two times the sum of: (A) the Executive\\'s annual rate of%%base recurring salary at the time of termination of employment; and (B) the%%Executive\\'s most recent award of cash and deferred stock under the Senior%%Management Short Term Incentive Plan.

In the event that the%%----------------------------------------------%%Executive voluntarily resigns or voluntarily retires, other than under%%circumstances that are treated as involuntary for purposes of Section 5 hereof,%%then the Chairman shall elect either:%%(i)  to pay the cash installments described in Section 5(a), or%%(ii) to waive the obligation of the Executive to comply with the covenants%%of Section 1 (but not Section 2) of this Agreement from and after the%%date of termination; provided, however, that the parties acknowledge%%that, in the event of any such waiver, the benefit-forfeiture%%provisions of the RIP and the PSP shall nevertheless remain applicable%%to the Executive, in accordance with the terms of those plans, as they%%may be amended from time to time.%%(b)  Misconduct.

Furthermore, in the event that a court of law or equity%%determines that the geographic scope of the covenants under Section 1, or the%%duration of any of the restrictions under this Agreement, are not enforceable,%%this Agreement shall hereby be deemed to be amended to the extent necessary, but%%only to the extent necessary, to permit the enforcement of the terms of this%%Agreement.%%(d)  Governing Law:  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in%%-------------%%accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.%%(e)  Entire Agreement:  Except for the terms and conditions of the%%----------------%%compensation and benefit plans applicable to the Executive (as such plans may be%%amended by the applicable Bell Atlantic Company from time to time), this%%Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of BAC, the Company and the%%Executive and supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements, and communications,%%whether oral or written, pertaining to the subject matter hereof; and this%%Agreement shall not be modified or amended except%%6%%by written agreement of the Executive, BAC and the Bell Atlantic Company which%%then employs the Executive.%%IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on the%%date first set forth above.%%BELL ATLANTIC CORPORATION%%By:______________________________________%%Raymond W. Smith%%Chairman of the Board and%%Chief Executive Officer%%THE EXECUTIVE%%_________________________________________%%Stuart C. Johnson%%BELL ATLANTIC NETWORK SERVICES, INC.%%By_______________________________________%%Mark J. Mathis,%%Vice President and General Counsel%%7%%EX-10.X%%12%%EXHIBIT 10X%%Exhibit 10x%%-----------%%EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT%%THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, made this 24th day of January, 1994, by and%%between Bell Atlantic Corporation (\"BAC\") and James R. Young (the \"Executive\").%%WHEREAS, competitive initiatives are vital to the success of the business%%of BAC and to each business entity, whether a corporation, partnership or other%%type of entity, in which, from time to time, BAC owns directly or indirectly a%%majority economic or voting interest (BAC and such majority-owned entities are%%collectively referred to herein as \"Bell Atlantic Companies\"); and%%WHEREAS, the Human Resources Committee (the \"HRC\") of the Board of%%Directors of BAC determined on November 22, 1993, that it is appropriate for BAC%%and other Bell Atlantic Companies to enter into agreements with certain officers%%for the following purposes:  (1) to assist in retaining the services of said%%officers throughout a crucial period during which Bell Atlantic expects to%%conclude a major corporate merger and otherwise accelerate the transformation of%%its business; (2) to obtain protection for BAC and other affected Bell Atlantic%%Companies in the form of non-compete and proprietary information covenants from%%said officers;and (3) in consideration for said covenants, to provide for%%severance benefits that any such officer may become eligible to receive under%%certain circumstances; and%%NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, including compensation%%and benefits recited below, the Executive and BAC hereby agree as follows:%%1.  Term of this Agreement:%%----------------------%%This Agreement shall be effective on and after the date first stated above%%and shall expire either on the second anniversary of the date of the first%%closing of the transactions contemplated by a letter of intent dated October 12,%%1993, among BAC, Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media, Inc., or on%%December 31, 1995, in the absence of any such closing prior to that date;%%provided, however, that in the event that the Executive\\'s employment terminates%%on or before said expiration date, this Agreement shall continue in force so%%long as rights and obligations of the respective parties hereunder remain in%%force by their terms.%%2.  Certain Involuntary Terminations of Employment.%%----------------------------------------------%%(a)  Consequences of Certain Involuntary Terminations.  In the event that%%------------------------------------------------%%the Bell Atlantic Company that then employs the Executive involuntarily%%terminates the Executive\\'s employment for a reason other than \"misconduct\" (as%%defined in Section 7), then BAC shall provide a cash separation benefit to the%%Executive in an amount%%1%%equal (before applicable withholding taxes) to three times the sum of:  (A) the%%Executive\\'s annual rate of base recurring salary at the time of termination of%%employment; and (B) the greater of (i) the value of the Executive\\'s most recent%%award of cash and deferred stock under the Senior Management Short Term%%Incentive Plan (the \"STIP\"), or (ii) the value of the most recent award of cash%%and deferred stock under the STIP for the Executive\\'s salary grade without%%taking into account any individual performance adjustments to the award.  This%%cash separation benefit shall be payable in three annual installments, the first%%of which shall be payable not later than 60 days after the termination of%%employment date, and the second and third of which shall be due on or about the%%first and second anniversaries, respectively, of said termination of employment,%%subject to the Executive\\'s continuing compliance with the terms of this%%Agreement.%%(b)  For purposes of Section 2(a), a termination of employment will be%%treated as involuntary, even if the termination is characterized for other%%purposes as voluntary, if, either:%%(i)  BAC acknowledges in a writing delivered to the Executive that the%%termination is considered to be involuntary for purposes of this%%Section; or%%(ii) the termination of employment is under duress.  An otherwise voluntary%%termination of employment will be considered involuntary, and \"under%%duress\", for purposes of this Section 2 of this Agreement, if, in the%%absence of misconduct on the part of the Executive, and without the%%Executive\\'s express written consent, any of the following events has%%occurred within 12 months prior to the Executive\\'s termination of%%employment: (A) the Executive\\'s status as a \"Senior Manager\" has been%%revoked; (B) the Executive\\'s base recurring salary has been reduced by%%more than 10%; (C) the Executive has suffered a negative individual%%performance adjustment which causes the Executive\\'s short term award%%under the STIP for a particular year to be reduced by 25% or more; or%%(D) the Executive\\'s responsibilities have been substantially reduced%%in type or scope, other than in a general reorganization of the%%management functions of one or more Bell Atlantic Companies, with the%%result that the Executive has materially less status and authority.%%3.   Certain Voluntary Terminations of Employment.%%--------------------------------------------%%(a)  Consequences of Certain Voluntary Terminations.  In the event that the%%----------------------------------------------%%Executive voluntarily resigns or voluntarily retires, other than under%%circumstances that are treated as involuntary for purposes of Section 2 hereof,%%then the Chairman shall elect either:%%(i)  to pay the cash separation benefit described in Section 2(a), and, in%%that event, the payment by the Bell Atlantic Company of the number and%%dollar amount of cash installments stated in Section 2(a) shall be the%%2%%Executive\\'s exclusive remedy for any cause of action asserted by, or%%any damages alleged to be suffered by, the Executive in connection%%with his employment with, or termination of employment from, any Bell%%Atlantic Company;%%(ii) to waive the obligation of the Executive to comply with the covenants%%of Section 4 (but not Section 5) of this Agreement from and after the%%date of termination; provided, however, that the parties acknowledge%%that, in the event of any such waiver, the benefit-forfeiture%%provisions of the Bell Atlantic Senior Management Retirement Income%%Plan (the \"RIP\") and the Bell Atlantic Performance Share Plan (the%%\"PSP\") shall nevertheless remain applicable to the Executive, in%%accordance with the terms of those plans, as they may be amended from%%time to time.%%(b)  Misconduct.  The Executive shall have no rights under this Section 3%%----------%%if BAC determines that there was misconduct by the Executive at or about the%%time of the Executive\\'s voluntary resignation or retirement.%%4.   Prohibition Against Competitive Activities:%%------------------------------------------%%(a)  Prohibited Conduct by the Executive:  During the period of the%%-----------------------------------%%Executive\\'s employment with any Bell Atlantic Company, and for a period of two%%years following the Executive\\'s retirement or termination of employment for any%%other reason from any and all Bell Atlantic Companies, the Executive, without%%the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of BAC, shall not:%%(i)  personally engage in \"Competitive Activities\" (as defined in paragraph%%4(b)) within any geographic area in which any Bell Atlantic Company is%%then engaged (or, at the time of the Executive\\'s termination of%%employment, had a board-approved business plan under which it planned%%to engage) in Competitive Activities;%%(ii) work for, own, manage, operate, control or participate in the%%ownership, management, operation or control of, or provide consulting%%or advisory services to, any individual, partnership, firm,%%corporation or institution engaged in Competitive Activities within%%any geographic area described in Section 4(a)(i); provided, however,%%that the Executive\\'s purchase or holding, for investment purposes, of%%securities of a publicly-traded company shall not constitute%%\"ownership\" or \"participation in ownership\" for purposes of this%%paragraph so long as the Executive\\'s equity interest in any such%%company is less than a controlling interest;%%(iii) interfere with the relationship of any Bell Atlantic Company with any%%of its employees, agents, representatives, suppliers or vendors under%%contract, or joint venturers, where any such person or entity%%cooperates with or supports a Bell Atlantic Company in its%%performance of any Competitive Activities; or%%3%%(iv) directly or indirectly attempt to divert from any Bell Atlantic%%Company any business in connection with Competitive Activities.%%(b)  Competitive Activities:  For purposes of Section 4(a) hereof,%%----------------------%%\"Competitive Activities\" means business activities relating to products or%%services of the same or similar type as those for which the Executive had%%responsibility to plan, develop, manage or oversee within the last 24 months of%%the Executive\\'s employment with any Bell Atlantic Company.%%(c)  Notice.  BAC shall send the Executive written notice in the event%%------%%that BAC believes that the Executive has violated any of the prohibitions of%%this Section 4; provided, however, that any failure by BAC to give notice under%%this provision or to enforce its rights under this Agreement in any one or more%%instances shall not be a bar to BAC giving notice and taking action to enforce%%its rights under this Agreement at any later time.%%(d)  Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive acknowledges that the%%----------------------%%Executive\\'s violation of any of the prohibitions of this Section 4 or the rules%%against wrongful competitive activity by the Executive as defined under the RIP%%and the PSP, as the terms of those plans may be amended from time to time, may%%result in the Executive\\'s forfeiture of any and all rights to benefits or awards%%under the RIP and the PSP.%%5.   Prohibition Against Disclosure of Proprietary Information:%%---------------------------------------------------------%%(a)  Prohibited Conduct by the Executive:  The Executive acknowledges that,%%-----------------------------------%%as one of the most senior officers of the Bell Atlantic Companies, the Executive%%has continuing access to confidential and proprietary information of Bell%%Atlantic Companies.  The Executive shall, therefore, at all times during the%%period of active employment with any Bell Atlantic Company, and for a period of%%three years thereafter, preserve the confidentiality of all proprietary%%information of any Bell Atlantic Company.  The three-year limitation under this%%paragraph shall not in any way limit any Bell Atlantic Company\\'s common law and%%statutory rights to protect its trade secrets or intellectual property rights at%%any time, to the full extent of the law. \"Proprietary information\" includes,%%but is not limited to, information in the possession or control of a Bell%%Atlantic Company that has not been fully disclosed in a writing which has been%%generally circulated to the public at large, and which gives the Bell Atlantic%%Company an opportunity to obtain or maintain advantages over its current and%%potential competitors, such as:%%-    strategic or tactical business plans, and undisclosed financial data;%%-    ideas, processes, methods, techniques, systems, patented or%%copyrighted information, models, devices, programs, computer software%%or related information;%%-    documents relating to regulatory matters and correspondence with%%governmental entities;%%-    pricing and cost data;%%-    reports and analyses of business prospects;%%4%%-    business transactions which are contemplated or planned;%%-    research data;%%-    personnel information and data;%%-    identities of users and purchasers of any Bell Atlantic Company\\'s%%products or services; and%%-    other confidential matters pertaining to or known by one or more Bell%%Atlantic Companies, including confidential information of a third%%party which a Bell Atlantic Company is bound to protect.%%(b)  Obligation to Return Company Property:  If and when the Executive%%-------------------------------------%%retires or terminates employment for any other reason with all Bell Atlantic%%Companies, the Executive shall, prior to the last day of active employment and%%without charge to any Bell Atlantic Company, return to the employing Bell%%Atlantic Company (or the rightful Bell Atlantic Company) all company property,%%including, without limitation, originals and copies of records, papers,%%programs, computer software, documents and other materials which contain%%Proprietary Information, as defined in Section 5(a).  The Executive shall%%thereafter cooperate with each applicable Bell Atlantic Company in executing and%%delivering documents requested by the company that are necessary to assist the%%Bell Atlantic Company in patenting or registering any programs, ideas,%%inventions, discoveries, copyright material or trademarks, and to vest title%%thereto in the Bell Atlantic Company.%%(c)  Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive acknowledges that the%%----------------------%%Executive\\'s violation of the prohibitions of this Section 5, or other%%\"misconduct\" by the Executive (as that term is interpreted by the HRC under the%%RIP and PSP plans, as those plans may be amended from time to time), may result%%in the Executive\\'s forfeiture of any and all rights to benefits or awards under%%the RIP and the PSP.%%6.   Remedies in Addition to Forfeiture of Benefits.  The Executive%%----------------------------------------------%%recognizes that irreparable injury will result to one or more Bell Atlantic%%Companies, and to the business and property of any of them, in the event of a%%breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of Section 5 or 6 of this%%Agreement, and that the Executive\\'s continued employment is predicated on the%%commitments made by the Executive in those Sections.  In the event of any breach%%of any of the Executive\\'s commitments under Section 5 or 6, any Bell Atlantic%%Company that is damaged by such breach shall be entitled, in addition to%%declaring a forfeiture of benefits as described herein, and in addition to any%%other remedies and damages available, to injunctive relief to restrain the%%violation of such commitments by the Executive or by any person or persons%%acting for or with the Executive in any capacity whatsoever.%%7.   Misconduct.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"misconduct\"%%----------%%shall mean a violation of law (other than a traffic violation or other minor%%civil offense), or behavior that BAC concludes amounts to a material breach of%%any company policy or provision of the Employee Code of Business Conduct, and%%including, by way of example: dishonesty; working outside the Bell Atlantic%%Companies in competition with any Bell Atlantic Company; other conduct that%%poses a material conflict of interest; revealing confidential or proprietary%%information of any%%5%%Bell Atlantic Company; or a substantial and deliberate abuse of the voucher or%%expense reimbursement processes of any Bell Atlantic Company.%%8.   Miscellaneous Provisions.%%------------------------%%(a)  Legal Release:  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,%%-------------%%no cash separation benefit under Section 2 or 3 hereof shall be payable unless%%and until the Executive signs a legal release in a form satisfactory to BAC;%%provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement is intended to cause the%%Executive to waive his right to submit claims for employee benefits in%%accordance with the terms of any employee benefit plans in which the Executive%%remains a participant.%%(b)  Assignment by the Company:  BAC may assign this Agreement without the%%-------------------------%%Executive\\'s consent to any company that acquires all or substantially all of the%%assets of BAC, or into which or with which BAC is merged or consolidated.  If%%and when the Executive transfers to a Bell Atlantic Company other than the%%current employing Bell Atlantic Company, this Agreement shall be deemed to be%%automatically assigned to that company; provided, however, that, in the event of%%any such transfer, BAC shall continue to be a party to this Agreement.  This%%Agreement may not be assigned by the Executive.%%(c)  Waiver:  The waiver by any Bell Atlantic Company of a breach by the%%------%%Executive of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver%%of any subsequent breach by the Executive.%%(d)  Severability:  If any clause, phrase or provision of this Agreement,%%------------%%or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid or%%unenforceable under any applicable law, such event shall not affect or render%%invalid or unenforceable the remainder of this Agreement and shall not affect%%the application of any clause, phrase or provision hereof to other persons or%%circumstances.  Furthermore, in the event that a court of law or equity%%determines that the geographic scope of the covenants under Section 4, or the%%duration of any of the restrictions under this Agreement, are not enforceable,%%this Agreement shall hereby be deemed to be amended to the extent necessary, but%%only to the extent necessary, to permit the enforcement of the terms of this%%Agreement.%%(e)  Governing Law:  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in%%-------------%%accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.%%(f)  Entire Agreement:  Except for the terms and conditions of the%%----------------%%compensation and benefit plans applicable to the Executive (as such plans may be%%amended by the applicable Bell Atlantic Company from time to time), this%%Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of BAC and the Executive and%%supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements, and communications, whether oral%%or written, pertaining to the subject matter hereof; and this Agreement shall%%not be modified or amended except by written agreement of the Executive, BAC and%%the Bell Atlantic Company which then employs the Executive.%%6%%IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on the%%date first set forth above.%%BELL ATLANTIC CORPORATION%%By:_________________________________________%%Raymond W.

It%%also was a year of great transformation in the basic structure of our industry,%%as our enabling technologies and the markets we serve continued to undergo fun-%%damental change.%%We believe this transformation creates tremendous growth opportunities for%%Bell Atlantic, and we made significant strides in implementing our strategies%%for capitalizing on them. These strategies--and our 1993 accomplishments--are%%outlined below.%%It appears, however, that our future will not include a merger with Tele-Com-%%munications Inc. (TCI) and Liberty Media Corporation. As many of you know, we%%announced our merger intentions in October 1993. Unfortunately, the market and%%regulatory uncertainties surrounding this course of action made reaching agree-%%ment on the final terms and conditions of a transaction of this magnitude im-%%possible. While we regret that we were unable to bring this merger to fruition,%%we believe that the decision to terminate negotiations is in the best long-term%%interests of our shareowners. Further, we are confident that there are many vi-%%able opportunities for making our vision of being a leading communications, in-%%formation, and entertainment company a reality--some of which may involve joint%%ventures with TCI and Liberty.%%In the meanwhile, we have moved ahead aggressively in equipping Bell Atlantic%%to be a major player in our industry, and will continue to seek out growth op-%%portunities that will add to the value of your investment.%%FINANCIAL REVIEW%%1993 was a year of strong operating earnings growth. As the U.S. economy con-%%tinued its recovery, growth in our basic telephone volumes improved, we sur-%%passed one million cellular customers, and our cellular subscriber growth ap-%%proached 50 percent. Moreover, we registered our one-millionth Answer Call cus-%%tomer, symbolic of strong demand for value-added services.%%This edition of the Annual Report is once again presented in the cost-%%effective, environmentally friendly format endorsed by 95 percent of shareowners%%we polled.%%Earnings for the year were reported at $3.22 per share, versus $3.13 in 1992,%%a 2.9 percent increase. However, the earnings-per-share increase was nearly 9%%percent if certain one-time and extraordinary items reported in both years were%%excluded. 1993 results were affected by the early adoption of a new accounting%%standard for post-employment benefits (FAS 112) and the effect of 1993 tax leg-%%islation. Excluding one-time items, net income grew 10.5 percent in 1993.%%We achieved another year of growth also in terms of revenues. Reported reve-%%nues--which reflect our decreased strategic emphasis on computer leasing and%%the disposition of most of our customer premises equipment business--increased%%2.1 percent in 1993. Operating revenues in our ongoing businesses (excluding%%these effects) were up 4.5 percent over 1992.%%The core network businesses accounted for more than one-half of Bell%%Atlantic\\'s earnings growth. Underpinning our bottom-line accomplishments were%%healthy increases in telephone volumes. Access minutes of use for 1993 were up%%7.2 percent over 1992, while message toll volumes grew 3.4 percent, and total%%access lines in service, 2.6 percent. The business market showed signs of%%strength, with business access lines and Centrex lines both achieving better%%than 4 percent growth.%%The demand for new services also continued to improve. Revenues from IQ(R)%%Services and other value-added services totaled $414 million, up more than 14%%percent over 1992 totals.%%Beyond the core network, Bell Atlantic Enterprises International--which in-%%cludes Bell Atlantic Mobile, our overseas entities and Bell Atlantic Business%%Systems Services--also made strong contributions to our revenue and earnings%%growth in 1993.%%At Bell Atlantic Mobile, we added 340,700 subscribers, an increase of almost%%49 percent, bringing the total number of cellular customers to just over 1 mil-%%lion. By comparison, the customer base grew 37.5 percent in 1992. 1993 cellular%%revenues were up 32 percent over 1992 levels.%%On the international scene, the value of Telecom Corporation of New Zealand%%shares has more than doubled in the three years since we invested in the compa-%%ny. Bell Atlantic recorded after-tax gains of $44.7 million resulting from 1993%%sales of the stock, as we reduced our interest in the%%3%%company to just under 25 percent per our agreement with the New Zealand govern-%%ment.%%Bell Atlantic Business Systems Services, our computer service subsidiary,%%added several prestigious national and international companies--such as AMR%%Corporation, parent of American Airlines Inc.--to its list of accounts and%%posted strong gains in both revenues and cash flow for the year.%%Expense management continued to be the watchword at Bell Atlantic during%%1993, as growth in total operating expenses from the prior year was essentially%%flat. Excluding depreciation and amortization, expenses actually fell 1.9 per-%%cent from 1992 totals. Moreover, we continued to take advantage of low interest%%rates by refinancing approximately $1.7 billion in long-term debt in 1993 and%%$1.8 billion in 1992. Refinancings in both years will result in annual interest%%savings of approximately $47 million over the next 10 years.%%Aside from our successful financial story in 1993, we made fundamental pro-%%gress in molding Bell Atlantic into a company poised for market leadership and%%solid growth in an environment of increasing competition, changing technology%%and rapidly emerging market opportunities.%%1993 HIGHLIGHTS%%Transforming ourselves into a company that can achieve high growth as well as%%improved earnings and cash flow growth involves more than entering new busi-%%nesses. It also involves changing our current business--improving the way we%%operate, achieving legislative and regulatory incentives, and preparing to com-%%pete across all lines of business. In those terms, we made significant progress%%on six key strategic fronts.%%. First, we announced our intention to lead the country in the deployment of%%the information highway.%%In December, we issued our technology requirements to potential suppliers for%%a new video-capable technology platform that will accelerate our entry into at-%%tractive markets for entertainment and interactive multimedia services. We ex-%%pect Bell Atlantic\\'s enhanced network will be ready to serve 8.75 million homes%%by the end of the year 2000. By the end of 1998, we plan to wire the top 20%%markets in our Mid-Atlantic region. These investments will help establish Bell%%Atlantic as a world leader in what is clearly the high-growth opportunity for%%the 1990s and beyond--interactive, multimedia communications, entertainment and%%information services that address the vast, unfulfilled demand for customer%%choice, convenience and control.%%We will spend $11 billion over the next five years to rapidly build full-%%service networks capable of providing these services within the Bell Atlantic%%region. What\\'s more, we will expand Bell Atlantic\\'s global presence by develop-%%ing attractive investment opportunities in Europe, Mexico and the Pacific Rim.%%. Second, we have restructured ourselves by market segments in order to focus%%our business on the needs of our customers.%%Our various lines of business--such as Consumer Services, Small Business%%Services and Carrier Services--will help us respond more quickly to customers%%and to meet their requirements better than our competitors. In staffing several%%of these businesses--for example, Consumer Services and Large and Small Busi-%%ness Services--we recruited extensively from outside the company to increase%%our marketing strength in this critical initiative.%%. Third, we continued to make major strides in the public policy arena toward%%achieving the freedoms necessary to compete.%%Last summer, the state legislatures in Pennsylvania and Delaware authorized%%new regulatory frameworks that, when implemented, will give us the incentives%%to invest in new technology and services that will meet customer needs and%%provide long-term growth opportunities in a competitive environment. Plans for%%similar alternative regulation have been approved or are pending in all seven%%state jurisdictions. Moreover, all telephone subsidiaries have been afforded%%some degree of pricing flexibility for products and services subject to%%competition.%%Perhaps the most significant public policy development last year was our suc-%%cessful challenge to the provision of the 1984 Cable Act that prohibits Bell%%Atlantic from providing video programming in its traditional service territo-%%ries. The District Court ruling opens lucrative new markets for Bell Atlantic%%as it expands consumer choice. It may prove to be a forerunner of even more%%change, as legislation proposing to lift remaining barriers to our full partic-%%ipation in the information marketplace makes its way through Congress.%%. Fourth, during 1993, we further improved our competitive posture by making%%our core businesses more cost-efficient and market-focused.%%Recognizing that competition is here to stay, we continued to re-vamp serv-%%ice-delivery processes to increase provisioning speed and reduce cost. We dem-%%onstrated our network reliability and provisioning speed in Northern New Jer-%%sey, where, by virtue of the synchronous optical network (SONET) fiber ring%%system in Jersey City, we were able to connect more than 2,400 telephone lines%%and 90 high-capacity data circuits in temporary facilities for businesses af-%%fected by the bombing of the%%4%%World Trade Center. Currently, we\\'re partnering with other companies to build%%ultra-high-speed fiber rings between New Jersey and New York City.%%Within the business itself, we plan to increase efficiency and reduce total%%network costs even further by developing and deploying state-of-the-art operat-%%ing systems.%%. Fifth, we continued to innovate within our existing core businesses by in-%%troducing new value-added services.%%Innovative network products such as IQ Services and Answer Call have made%%strong contributions to positive revenue growth in our traditional markets. In%%1993, we posted close to $300 million in recurring revenues from products in-%%troduced since 1989. In the future, we will continue our steady stream of serv-%%ice introductions, which will include CritiCall(SM) emergency notification and%%monitoring service and voice-activated services.%%In the wireless arena, 1993 saw us introduce TraveLink(SM), a service that au-%%tomatically delivers incoming cellular calls to roaming customers, and we an-%%nounced upcoming trials of Spoken Caller Identification, which identifies call-%%ers to a mobile phone by name or number with a digitized voice. In 1993, we in-%%troduced the AirBridge(SM) family of services that provide a range of wireless%%data applications, including mobile fax, electronic mail, mobile computing con-%%nections, package tracking, and remote device monitoring and control.%%In the business market, we will continue to strengthen our presence by meet-%%ing data transport needs for large and small businesses with a basket of high-%%bandwidth services, such as Switched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS) and%%Frame Relay.%%. Sixth, and finally, we\\'re expanding both within and beyond our region by%%choosing the appropriate markets and technology platforms to establish Bell%%Atlantic as the full-service network provider of choice for entertainment,%%communication and multimedia services.%%In some areas, the point of entry to these new market opportunities might be%%our existing telephone network. We recently announced plans to expand our%%Stargazer(SM) video-on-demand trial over existing telephone lines to a full mar-%%ket trial involving tens of thousands of customers in the Maryland and Virginia%%suburbs of Washington, D.C.%%In other places, the entry point might be cellular, or other wireless tech-%%nologies such as personal communications services. In 1994, we expect to par-%%ticipate in the FCC spectrum auctioning process for an opportunity to establish%%a national wireless footprint. Still another option is to team with cable tele-%%vision operators to establish a market presence outside of our region.%%On the international front, our agreement to acquire up to a 46 percent in-%%terest in Grupo Iusacell, S.A. de C.V., the second-largest telecommunications%%company in Mexico, represents the most significant overseas wireless investment%%in our history.%%While it is focused primarily on cellular today, Iusacell plans to use non-%%cellular radio spectrum to provide basic telephone service in Mexico, where%%there is currently a huge, unfulfilled demand. Moreover, the company is well%%positioned to compete in the long-distance business after Mexico opens up that%%business to full competition in August of 1996.%%MAXIMIZING VALUE%%In implementing each of these strategies, our focus will be on prudent capital%%investing in opportunities that provide value to our customers and growth to%%our shareowners. Along the way, we will continue to emphasize our single most%%important financial imperative--to increase capital efficiency, maximizing our%%return from every dollar spent. In the network, for example, we\\'re re-allocat-%%ing investment dollars to broadband technologies without significantly ex-%%panding our capital budget. What\\'s more, we continue to accelerate capital re-%%covery and target investments at new markets that promise high returns or where%%there are attractive opportunities for expansion.%%Our business opportunity for 1994 and beyond is straightforward--enhance the%%value of our core businesses by expanding our customer and service base, and%%develop high-growth businesses in the video entertainment, cable transport, ca-%%ble television, and information services markets.%%In summary, transforming ourselves for long-term growth has been a deliber-%%ate, ongoing process at Bell Atlantic. In 1993, we were highly successful not%%only at achieving strong operating results, but more important, at changing our%%methods, sharpening our customer focus, and preparing ourselves for a leading%%role in creating a new age in telecommunications.%%I could not be more confident about where we\\'re headed.%%/s/ Raymond W.

Results for 1993 included the%%cumulative effects of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.%%112, \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits\" (Statement No. 112)%%and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, \"Accounting for Income%%Taxes\" (Statement No. 109). The loss in 1991 reflected a charge of $1,554.3%%million, or $3.63 per share, for the adoption of Statement of Financial%%Accounting Standards No. 106, \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postretirement%%Benefits Other Than Pensions\" (Statement No. 106). Results for 1993 represented%%increases of 4.7% in net income and 2.9% in earnings per share over 1992,%%attributable to operating income growth of 11.6%, fueled by improved business%%volumes and expense controls, and lower interest costs, partially offset by%%higher income taxes. Results for 1992 represented increases of 9.0% in net%%income and 7.6% in earnings per share over 1991, excluding the cumulative%%effect of the adoption of Statement No. 106.%%Other items affecting the comparison of operating results are discussed in%%the following sections.%%Operating Revenues%%Local service revenues are earned by the telephone subsidiaries from the%%provision of local exchange, local private line, and public telephone services.%%Local service revenues increased $163.8 million or 3.3% and $134.3 million or%%2.8% in 1993 and 1992, respectively. The increase in both years resulted%%primarily from growth in network access lines and higher demand for value-added%%central office services such as Custom Calling and Caller ID. Access lines in%%service at December 31, 1993 and 1992 increased 2.6% and 2.4%, respectively,%%over the prior year. Revenues from value-added central office services offered%%by the telephone subsidiaries increased $51.3 million or 14.1% in 1993 compared%%with $42.1 million or 13.1% growth in 1992.%%Network access revenues are received from interexchange carriers (IXCs) for%%their use of the Company\\'s local exchange facilities in providing long-distance%%services to IXCs\\' customers and from end-user subscribers. Switched access%%revenues are derived from usage-based charges paid by IXCs for access to the%%Company\\'s network. Special access revenues arise from access charges paid by%%customers who have private lines, and end-user access revenues are earned from%%local exchange carrier customers who pay for access to the network.%%Network access revenues increased $117.8 million or 4.0% in 1993 and $31.0%%million or 1.1% in 1992. Growth in access minutes of use was 7.2% and 4.3% in%%the respective periods. Revenue increases related to this volume growth were%%partially offset in both years by the effect of interstate rate reductions%%filed by the Company with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which%%became effective on July 2, 1993 and July 1, 1992, and by related estimated%%price cap sharing liabilities.%%Toll service revenues increased $1.8 million or 0.1% in 1993 and $17.5%%million or 1.1% in 1992. Toll message volume growth was 3.4% in 1993 compared%%with 2.9% in 1992. Volume-related message toll service revenue increases were%%partially offset in 1993 and 1992 by declines in revenues from WATS and private%%line services, principally due to competitive pressures. In 1993, revenue%%growth was offset further by the effects of rate reductions at one of the%%telephone subsidiaries.%%Other Network Services revenues include amounts earned from directory%%advertising, billing and collection services provided to IXCs, premises%%services such as inside wire installation and maintenance, and certain%%nonregulated enhanced network services. Directory advertising revenues in 1993%%increased $27.1 million or 2.7% compared to a $25.3 million or 2.5% increase in%%1992. Revenue growth was adversely impacted in both years by decreasing sales%%volume attributable primarily to competition. In addition, the rate of economic%%recovery as it pertains to this line of business continues to be mixed within%%the Network Services operating region. Premises services revenues increased%%$25.2 million or 9.6% and $10.9 million or 4.3% in 1993 and 1992, respectively,%%principally as a result of higher business volumes. Revenues from Answer Call,%%a nonregulated enhanced network service, were $50.6 million, $27.9 million, and%%$13.0 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. Billing and collection%%revenues decreased $23.0 million in 1993 primarily as a result of the effect of%%favorable claim adjustments recorded in 1992. Billing and collection revenues%%were also reduced in 1993 as a result of reductions in services provided under%%long-term contracts with certain IXCs.%%7%%The provision for uncollectibles, expressed as a percentage of total Network%%Services revenue, was 1.4% in 1993, 1.1% in 1992, and 1.0% in 1991.%%Other Communications and Related Services includes revenues from the%%Company\\'s domestic and international operations in wireless communications,%%computer maintenance, software development and support, systems integration,%%and telecommunications consulting. These revenues grew $78.9 million or 6.5% in%%1993 compared with $81.9 million or 7.2% in 1992. The continued growth of the%%Company\\'s cellular customer base was the primary reason for increases in%%cellular revenues of $187.3 million or 32.0% in 1993 and $103.0 million or%%21.3% in 1992. Revenues in both years also reflected increases in business%%volumes in the Company\\'s third-party computer maintenance business. These%%increases were offset in 1993 by a revenue decrease of approximately $177%%million due to the effect of the transfer, effective December 31, 1992, of the%%Bell Atlanticom Systems, Inc. (Atlanticom) business to a partnership in which%%the Company owns a minority interest. Revenue growth in 1992 was reduced by%%$58.5 million due to the effect of the July 1991 transfer of the Company\\'s%%European computer maintenance business to a joint venture.%%Financial, Real Estate, and Other Services includes revenues from the%%Company\\'s domestic and international operations in diversified leasing,%%computer leasing, real estate, and liquefied petroleum gas distribution. The%%decreases in these revenues were due principally to the Company\\'s decreased%%emphasis on computer leasing and real estate operations. The decreasing revenue%%trend is expected to continue throughout 1994. In line with its continuing de-%%emphasis of financial services businesses over the past years and its%%intensified focus on core telecommunications and information services%%strategies, the Company announced that it has begun evaluating possible%%strategies for exiting its financial services businesses. The Company has filed%%a registration statement for an initial public offering to dispose of a%%significant portion of its diversified leasing business. Assuming successful%%completion of the initial public offering, future periods will no longer%%include a significant portion of revenues from this business. Revenues related%%to the business covered in the registration statement were $245.3 million for%%the twelve months ended December 31, 1993. The disposition is not expected to%%have a material impact on the Company\\'s net income in 1994.%%Operating Expenses%%Employee costs consist of salaries, wages and other employee compensation,%%employee benefits, and payroll taxes. Employee costs increased $86.1 million or%%2.2% in 1993. Higher employee costs from salary and wage increases and overtime%%at the telephone subsidiaries were offset in part by savings of approximately%%$160 million resulting from workforce reduction programs implemented in 1992 at%%the Network Services companies. Workforce increases at certain nonregulated%%subsidiaries also contributed to higher employee costs, which were offset in%%part by a reduction attributable to the Atlanticom transaction.%%Employee costs decreased $51.1 million or 1.3% in 1992, which reflected%%savings of over $150 million resulting from a 1991 retirement incentive program%%and a reduction of $68.0 million in pension expense resulting from a%%modification of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. These%%reductions were partially offset by salary and wage increases for management%%and associate employees and expenses of approximately $73 million associated%%with the 1992 workforce reduction programs.%%The Company continues to evaluate ways to streamline and restructure its%%operations and reduce its workforce requirements in an effort to improve its%%cost structure.%%Depreciation and amortization expense increased $127.7 million or 5.3% in%%1993 due primarily to approximately $135 million of additional expense%%resulting from represcribed depreciation rates at three of the telephone%%subsidiaries. Also contributing to the increase was growth in the level of%%depreciable plant at the telephone and cellular subsidiaries in 1993. Partially%%offsetting these increases was a reduction in depreciation and amortization%%expense at the financial services and real estate companies of approximately%%$59 million due to the de-emphasis of computer leasing and real estate%%operations.%%Depreciation and amortization expense increased $78.6 million or 3.4% in%%1992. Depreciation and amortization expense at the telephone subsidiaries%%increased by approximately $180 million, of which approximately $150 million%%was attributable to represcribed depreciation rates. Also contributing to the%%increase was growth in the level of depreciable telephone plant, offset in part%%by the discontinuance of certain regulator-approved amortizations. These%%increases were partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization%%8%%expense at the financial services and real estate companies of approximately%%$119 million due to the de-emphasis of computer leasing and real estate%%operations.%%Other operating expenses decreased $233.4 million or 6.1% in 1993. This%%reduction was largely the result of a decrease of approximately $184 million%%due to the transfer of the Atlanticom business to a partnership. The decrease%%also included the effect of the recognition in 1992 of approximately $47%%million of one-time costs associated with the Company\\'s merger with Metro%%Mobile CTS, Inc. (Metro Mobile). Additional decreases resulting from lower%%expenses at the financial services and real estate companies and Network%%Services companies were largely offset by increases related to higher business%%volumes at the Company\\'s cellular and computer maintenance subsidiaries.%%Other operating expenses increased $157.9 million or 4.3% in 1992 due%%primarily to higher business volumes at the Company\\'s cellular subsidiaries,%%recognition of approximately $47 million of one-time costs associated with the%%Metro Mobile merger, and increased deployment of advanced switching software%%at the telephone subsidiaries. These increases were offset in part by%%decreased expenses at the financial services companies, primarily as a result%%of lower interest costs associated with reduced debt levels in 1992, and the%%effect of the July 1991 transfer of the Company\\'s European computer%%maintenance business to a joint venture. Company-wide cost containment efforts%%also reduced expenses during 1992.%%Assuming successful completion of the initial public offering to dispose of%%a significant portion of the Company\\'s diversified leasing business, future%%periods will no longer include a significant portion of expenses from this%%business. Operating expenses related to the business covered in the%%registration statement were $191.6 million for the twelve months ended%%December 31, 1993.%%Other Income and Expense%%Other income and expense includes equity income from the Company\\'s%%investment in unconsolidated businesses, interest and dividend income, and%%gains and losses from the disposition of assets and investments. Other income,%%net of expense, was $88.1 million in 1993, $214.4 million in 1992, and $176.2%%million in 1991.%%The 1993 decrease is primarily the result of gains on the sale of certain%%assets recorded in 1992 and approximately $32 million of interest income%%recognized in 1992 in connection with the settlement of various federal income%%tax matters related to prior periods. Other income and expense for 1993%%included approximately $42 million representing the Company\\'s share of%%restructuring charges taken by Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Limited%%(Telecom), a pretax gain of approximately $65 million related to the private%%sales of a portion of the Company\\'s investment in Telecom, and a pretax charge%%of approximately $26 million associated with a planned disposition of certain%%non-strategic businesses.%%The increase in 1992 reflects gains on sales of shares in HCA-Hospital%%Corporation of America (HCA) and real estate. The aggregate amount of these%%gains was virtually the same as the 1991 gains related to the Company\\'s sales%%of shares in Telecom and real estate and the transfer of the Company\\'s%%European computer maintenance business to a joint venture. The increase in%%1992 also included approximately $32 million of interest income recognized in%%connection with the settlement of various federal income tax matters related%%to prior periods.%%Other income and expense, net, in 1994 is expected to decrease significantly%%due to goodwill amortization associated with the Company\\'s equity investment%%in Grupo Iusacell, S.A. de C.V. (Iusacell), a Mexican telecommunications%%company.%%Interest Expense, Excluding Financial Services%%Interest expense decreased $82.8 million or 11.9% and $111.9 million or%%13.9% in 1993 and 1992, respectively, principally due to the effects of lower%%short-term interest rates and long-term debt refinancings. Decreases also%%resulted from lower interest costs associated with the Telecom investment, as%%proceeds from the Company\\'s sale of Telecom shares in 1993 and 1991 were used%%to reduce a portion of the acquisition-related debt. The effect of a $16.9%%million write-off of deferred financing costs at Metro Mobile in 1991 also%%contributed to the decrease in 1992.%%Income Taxes%%The provision for income taxes increased $148.5 million or 23.1% in 1993%%compared to a decrease of $21.3 million or 3.2% in 1992.%%9%%The Company\\'s effective income tax rate was 34.8% in 1993, 31.8% in 1992, and%%35.1% in 1991. The 1993 effective tax rate reflects the effect of federal tax%%legislation enacted in 1993, which increased the federal corporate tax rate%%from 34% to 35%. The lower effective tax rate in 1992 resulted from certain%%adjustments to deferred taxes and the recognition in 1992 of consolidated tax%%benefits attributable to operations of the Metro Mobile business. These tax%%benefits were not recognized in previous years. A reconciliation of the%%statutory federal income tax rate to the effective rate for each period is%%provided in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.%%Extraordinary Item%%The Company called $1,525.0 million in 1993 and $1,081.0 million in 1992 of%%long-term debentures of several of the telephone subsidiaries, which were%%refinanced at more favorable interest rates. As a result of these early%%retirements, the Company incurred after-tax charges of $58.4 million in 1993%%and $41.6 million in 1992. These debt refinancings will reduce interest costs%%on the refinanced debt by approximately $47 million annually over the next ten%%years.%%Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles%%In connection with the adoption of Statement No. 109, effective January 1,%%1993, the Company recorded a one-time, cumulative effect tax benefit of $65.2%%million in 1993 (see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).%%In connection with the adoption of Statement No. 112, effective January 1,%%1993, the Company recorded a one-time, cumulative effect after-tax charge of%%$85.0 million in 1993 (see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial%%Statements).%%The adoption of Statement No. 109 and Statement No. 112 did not have a%%significant effect on the Company\\'s ongoing level of expense in 1993 and is not%%expected to have a significant effect in future periods.%%COMPETITION AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT%%The telecommunications industry is currently undergoing fundamental changes%%which may have a significant impact on future financial performance of all%%telecommunications companies. These changes are driven by a number of factors,%%including the accelerated pace of technology change, customer requirements, a%%changing industry structure characterized by strategic alliances and the%%convergence of telecommunications and cable television, and a changing%%regulatory environment in which traditional regulatory barriers are being%%lowered and competition encouraged.%%The convergence of cable television, computer technology, and%%telecommunications can be expected to dramatically increase competition in the%%future. The Company\\'s existing telecommunications business is already subject%%to competition from numerous sources, including competitive access providers%%for network access services (and in some jurisdictions for intraLATA toll%%services), competing cellular telephone companies and others.%%During 1993, a number of business alliances were announced that have the%%potential to significantly increase competition both within the industry and%%the areas currently served by Bell Atlantic. Over the past several years, the%%Company has taken a number of actions in anticipation of the increasingly%%competitive environment. Cost reductions have been achieved, giving the Company%%greater pricing flexibility for services exposed to competition. A new lines of%%business organization structure was adopted. Narrowband network modernization%%programs were largely completed, permitting a greater proportion of existing%%capital resources to be reallocated to the deployment of broadband network%%platforms to address the opportunities afforded by the emerging multimedia%%market. On the regulatory front, alternative regulation plans have been%%approved or are pending in all seven state jurisdictions. Moreover, all%%telephone subsidiaries have been afforded some degree of pricing flexibility%%for products and services subject to competition. Initiatives such as the%%Company\\'s challenge to the 1984 Cable Act and the formation of an Information%%Services business unit staffed by experienced people from the video and%%entertainment industry have created opportunities for the Company in the%%information services and video markets.%%In October 1993, the Company announced its intention to invest up to a total%%of $1.04 billion to acquire a 42% (or, under certain circumstances, up to a%%46%) economic interest in Grupo Iusacell, S.A. de C.V. (Iusacell), the second%%largest telecommunications company in Mexico. In November 1993, the Company%%acquired a 23% economic interest in Iusacell through the purchase of $520.0%%million of newly issued Iusacell stock. The Company\\'s acquisition of additional%%interests is expected to occur in mid-1994. This investment will substantially%%increase the size of the Company\\'s cellular holdings. As a result of its%%investment in Iusacell, the Company expects earnings%%10%%dilution for the first several years due to the amortization of goodwill and%%financing costs. Earnings dilution is expected to be approximately $.14 per%%share in 1994. In the longer term, this investment should substantially%%increase the contribution that the wireless business makes to the Company\\'s%%earnings growth.%%In October 1993, the Company also announced the execution of a letter of%%intent regarding a stock-for-stock merger among the Company, Tele-%%Communications Inc. and Liberty Media Corporation. On February 23, 1994, the%%parties announced that they had been unable to reach final agreement on their%%proposed merger and had terminated negotiations. The parties continue to%%discuss other ways of working together, including possible joint ventures to%%build full-service networks and joint investment in programming.%%The Company conducts ongoing evaluations of its accounting practices, many of%%which have been prescribed by regulators. These evaluations include the%%assessment of whether costs that have been deferred as a result of actions of%%regulators and the cost of the Company\\'s telephone plant will be recoverable in%%the future. In the event recoverability of costs becomes unlikely due to%%decisions by the Company to accelerate deployment of new technology in response%%to specific regulatory actions or increasing levels of competition, the Company%%may no longer apply the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting%%Standards No. 71, \"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation\"%%(Statement No. 71). The discontinued application of Statement No. 71 would%%require the Company to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities and may%%require the Company to adjust the carrying amount of its telephone plant should%%it determine that such amount is not recoverable. The Company believes that it%%continues to meet the criteria for continued financial reporting under%%Statement No. 71. A determination in the future that such criteria are no%%longer met may result in a significant one-time, noncash, extraordinary charge,%%if the Company determines that a substantial portion of the carrying value of%%its telephone plant may not be recoverable.%%In October 1993, the FCC issued a report and order allocating radio spectrum%%to be licensed for use in providing personal communications services (PCS).%%Under the order, seven separate bandwidths of spectrum, ranging in size from 10%%MHz to 30 MHz, would be auctioned to potential PCS providers in each geographic%%area of the United States. The geographical units by which the licenses would%%be allocated will be \"basic trading areas\" or larger \"major trading areas.\"%%Five of the spectrum blocks are to be auctioned on a basic trading area basis,%%and the remaining two are to be auctioned by major trading area. Local exchange%%carriers such as the Company are eligible to bid for PCS licenses, except that%%cellular carriers (such as the Company) are limited to obtaining 10 MHz of PCS%%bandwidth in areas where they provide cellular service. Bidders other than%%cellular providers may obtain multiple licenses aggregating up to 40 MHz of%%bandwidth in any area. Bell Atlantic has stated that it intends to pursue PCS%%licenses in the auctions, which are expected to be held in 1994.%%In August 1993, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of%%Virginia ruled unconstitutional the 1984 Cable Act\\'s limitation on in-territory%%provision of programming by local exchange carriers such as the Company. The%%Cable Act currently prohibits local exchange carriers from owning more than 5%%%of any company that provides cable programming in their local service area. In%%a case originally brought by two Bell Atlantic subsidiaries, the court ruled%%that this prohibition violates the First Amendment\\'s freedom of speech%%protections, and enjoined enforcement of the prohibition against the Company%%and its telephone subsidiaries. The ruling has been appealed by the federal%%government.%%OTHER MATTERS%%Four of the telephone subsidiaries have been designated as potentially%%responsible parties by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in connection%%with eight Superfund sites. Designation as a potentially responsible party%%subjects the named company to potential liability for costs relating to cleanup%%of the affected sites. Management believes that the aggregate amount of any%%potential liability would not have a material effect on the Company\\'s financial%%condition or results of operations.%%FINANCIAL CONDITION%%Management believes that the Company has adequate internal and external%%resources available to meet ongoing operating requirements, including network%%expansion and modernization, business development, and the payment of%%dividends. Management expects that presently foreseeable capital requirements%%will be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Additional long-%%term debt or equity financing may be needed to fund development activities to%%maintain the Company\\'s capital structure within management\\'s guidelines.%%11%%As of December 31, 1993, the Company and its subsidiaries had in excess of%%$2.0 billion of unused bank lines of credit and shelf registrations for the%%issuance of up to $2.3 billion of unsecured debt securities.%%During 1993, as in prior years, the Company\\'s primary source of funds%%continued to be cash generated from operations. Revenue growth, cost%%containment measures and savings on interest costs contributed to cash provided%%from operations of $4.23 billion for the year ended December 31, 1993, compared%%to $3.91 billion in 1992. In addition, in 1993, the sale of a portion of the%%Company\\'s interest in Telecom provided cash proceeds from investing activities%%of $253.7 million. In 1992, sales of real estate and HCA stock, and the%%disposition of businesses, provided net cash proceeds from investing activities%%of approximately $393 million.%%In March 1994, the Company expects to receive a payment of approximately $65%%million in connection with a capital reduction plan by Telecom in which 20% of%%Telecom\\'s outstanding shares will be canceled on a pro rata basis and%%shareholders will receive one New Zealand Dollar for each share canceled.%%Telecom\\'s capital reduction will not change the Company\\'s ownership percentage%%of Telecom.%%The primary use of capital resources continued to be capital expenditures.%%The Company invested approximately $2.1 billion in 1993, $2.2 billion in 1992,%%and $2.3 billion in 1991 in the telephone subsidiaries\\' network. This level of%%investment is expected to continue in 1994. The Company plans to reallocate%%capital resources to the deployment of broadband network platforms, as capital%%requirements for the narrowband network modernization are reduced. During 1993,%%the Company funded $289.1 million of postretirement health care and pension%%benefit costs compared to $348.6 million in 1992. In 1993, the Company used%%$674.4 million of cash in connection with its investment in Iusacell and the%%acquisition of two directory sales companies and certain cellular properties.%%The Company reduced long-term debt (including capital leases) and short-term%%debt by $168.2 million in 1993 and $764.4 million in 1992. Approximately $1.7%%billion and $1.8 billion of debt was refinanced at more favorable interest%%rates during 1993 and 1992, respectively. The Company\\'s debt ratio was 54.6% as%%of December 31, 1993, compared to 56.3% at December 31, 1992.%%The Company issued shares of its common stock for cash, in satisfaction of%%liabilities and in connection with acquisitions (see Note 6 of Notes to%%Consolidated Financial Statements).%%12%%REPORT OF MANAGEMENT%%The management of Bell Atlantic Corporation is responsible for the%%consolidated financial statements and the information and representations%%contained in this report. Management believes that the financial statements%%have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles%%and that the information in this report is consistent with those statements.%%Management is required to include in the financial statements amounts,%%primarily related to matters not concluded by year-end, that are based on%%management\\'s best estimates and judgments.%%In meeting its responsibility for the financial statements of the Company,%%management maintains a strong internal control structure, including the%%appropriate control environment, accounting systems, and control procedures.%%The internal control structure is designed to provide reasonable assurance that%%assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition, that transactions%%are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management\\'s%%authorizations, and that the financial records permit the preparation of%%reliable financial statements. There are, however, inherent limitations that%%should be recognized in considering the assurances provided by the internal%%control structure. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the%%costs of the internal control structure should not exceed the benefits to be%%derived. The internal control structure is reviewed and evaluated on a regular%%basis. Compliance is monitored by the internal auditors through an annual plan%%of internal audits.%%The Board of Directors pursues its review and oversight role for the%%financial statements through an Audit Committee composed of four outside%%directors. The duties of the Audit Committee include recommending to the Board%%of Directors the appointment of an independent accounting firm to audit the%%financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Audit Committee%%meets periodically with management and the Board of Directors. It also meets%%with representatives of the internal auditors and independent accountants and%%reviews the work of each to ensure that their respective responsibilities are%%being carried out and to discuss related matters. Both the internal auditors%%and independent accountants have direct access to the Audit Committee.%%The financial statements of the Company have been audited by Coopers &%%Lybrand, independent accountants, whose report is included on page 14.%%/s/ Raymond W.

These financial statements are the%%responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an%%opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.%%We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing%%standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain%%reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of%%material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence%%supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit%%also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant%%estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial%%statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis%%for our opinion.%%In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in%%all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Bell Atlantic%%Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the%%consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the%%three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally%%accepted accounting principles.%%As discussed in Notes 1, 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements,%%the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and%%postemployment benefits in 1993 and postretirement benefits other than pensions%%in 1991.%%/s/ Coopers & Lybrand%%2400 Eleven Penn Center%%Philadelphia, Pennsylvania%%February 7, 1994%%14%%BELL ATLANTIC CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES%%CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME%%FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31%%(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)%%1993       1992       1991%%---------  ---------  ---------%%Operating Revenues%%Communications and Related Services%%Network Services%%Local service............................... $ 5,055.9  $ 4,892.1  $ 4,757.8%%Network access..............................   3,070.9    2,953.1    2,922.1%%Toll service................................   1,558.0    1,556.2    1,538.7%%Directory advertising, billing services, and%%other......................................   1,704.6    1,658.9    1,599.2%%Provision for uncollectibles................

Investments in less-than-majority-owned%%businesses, including the Company\\'s investments in Telecom Corporation of New%%Zealand Limited (Telecom), Grupo Iusacell, S.A. de C.V., a one-seventh interest%%in Bell Communications Research, Inc., several cellular mobile communications%%and real estate partnerships, and several other domestic and international%%joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method. The portion of the%%Company\\'s investment in Telecom that was required to be sold was accounted for%%using the cost method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions%%have been eliminated.%%Network Services consists of the Company\\'s seven telephone subsidiaries and%%subsidiaries that provide centralized management, financing, and technical%%services. Financial Services consists of the Company\\'s lease financing%%subsidiaries.%%The telephone subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial%%statements using generally accepted accounting principles applicable to%%regulated entities.%%Revenue Recognition%%Revenues are recognized as earned on the accrual basis.%%The telephone subsidiaries recognize revenues when services are rendered%%based on usage of the Company\\'s local exchange network and facilities. For%%Other Communications and Related Services, revenue is recognized when products%%are delivered or services are rendered to customers. Cellular operations%%revenue includes access and usage, equipment, and gross roamer revenue into and%%out of the Company\\'s markets.%%Financial, Real Estate, and Other Services revenues primarily result from%%leasing transactions, which are recorded in accordance with Statement of%%Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, \"Accounting for Leases.\"%%Direct finance lease receivables consist of the gross minimum lease payments%%receivable under the leases plus the estimated residual value of the leased%%property less the unearned income. Unearned income represents the excess of the%%gross minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value over%%the cost of the equipment leased. Unearned income is amortized to income over%%the term of the lease by methods that provide an approximately level rate of%%return on the net investment in the lease.%%Leveraged lease receivables consist of the aggregate minimum rentals%%receivable under the leases, net of related nonrecourse debt, plus the%%estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income. The%%unearned income represents the estimated pretax lease income and unamortized%%investment tax credits.%%Accumulated deferred income taxes arising from leveraged leases are deducted%%from leveraged lease receivables to determine the net investment in leveraged%%leases. Unearned income is recognized at a rate that will distribute income to%%years in which the net investment in the leveraged lease is positive.%%Operating lease income is recognized in equal monthly amounts over the term%%of the lease.%%Cash and Cash Equivalents%%The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90%%days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated%%at cost, which approximates market value.%%Short-term Investments%%Short-term investments consist of investments that mature 91 days to 12%%months from the date of purchase. Short-term investments are stated at cost,%%which approximates market value.%%18%%Inventories%%New and reusable materials of the telephone subsidiaries are carried in%%inventory, principally at average original cost, except that specific costs are%%used in the case of large individual items. Nonreusable material is carried at%%estimated salvage value. Inventories of other subsidiaries are carried at the%%lower of cost (determined principally on either an average or first-in, first-%%out basis) or market.%%Prepaid Directory%%Costs of directory production and advertising sales are deferred until the%%directory is published. Such costs are amortized to expense and the related%%advertising revenues are recognized over the average life of the directory,%%which is generally 12 months.%%Plant and Depreciation%%The telephone subsidiaries\\' provision for depreciation is based principally%%on the remaining life method of depreciation and straight-line composite rates.%%The provision for depreciation is based on the following estimated remaining%%service lives: buildings, 25 to 35 years; central office equipment, 2 to 12%%years; cable, wiring, and conduit, 9 to 45 years; and other equipment, 2 to 20%%years. This method provides for the recovery of the remaining net investment in%%telephone plant, less anticipated net salvage value, over the remaining service%%lives authorized by regulatory commissions. Depreciation expense also includes%%amortization of certain classes of telephone plant (and certain identified%%depreciation reserve deficiencies) over periods authorized by regulatory%%commissions.%%When depreciable plant of the telephone subsidiaries is replaced or retired,%%the amounts at which such plant has been carried in plant, property and%%equipment are removed from the respective accounts and charged to accumulated%%depreciation, and any gains or losses on disposition are amortized over the%%remaining service lives of the remaining net investment in telephone plant.%%Plant, property and equipment of other subsidiaries is depreciated%%principally on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:%%buildings, 15 to 40 years; and other equipment, 2 to 16 years. When the%%depreciable assets of these subsidiaries are retired or otherwise disposed of,%%the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective%%accounts, and any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in income.%%Maintenance and Repairs%%The cost of maintenance and repairs of plant, including the cost of replacing%%minor items not constituting substantial betterments, is charged to operating%%expenses.%%Allowance for Funds Used During Construction%%Regulatory commissions allow the telephone subsidiaries to record an%%allowance for funds used during construction, which includes both interest and%%equity return components, as a cost of plant and as an item of other income.%%Such income is not recovered in cash currently, but will be recoverable over%%the service life of the plant through higher depreciation expense recognized%%for regulatory purposes.%%Equipment Under Operating Leases%%Equipment under operating leases is depreciated to estimated residual value%%principally by using a sum-of-the-years-digits method.%%Cost in Excess of Net Assets Acquired%%The excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets of%%businesses acquired, which is included in noncurrent other assets, is amortized%%by the straight-line method over periods not exceeding 40 years.%%Foreign Currency Translation%%Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional%%currency is the local currency are translated at current exchange rates.%%Revenues and expenses are translated using average rates during the year.%%Resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a separate%%component of Shareowners\\' Investment. Exchange gains and losses on certain%%balances of a long-term investment nature between consolidated subsidiaries%%also are recorded in the separate component of Shareowners\\' Investment. Other%%transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate changes on%%transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are%%included in results of operations as incurred.%%19%%Financial Instruments%%In the normal course of business, the Company employs a variety of off-%%balance-sheet financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in%%interest and foreign exchange rates, including interest rate swap agreements%%and forward exchange contracts. The Company designates interest rate swaps as%%hedges of direct finance lease receivable transfer agreements and debt, and%%accrues the differential to be paid or received under the agreements as%%interest rates change and recognizes this expense over the life of the%%contracts. Realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from forward%%exchange contracts that hedge certain balances of a long-term investment nature%%are included in Shareowners\\' Investment. Realized and unrealized gains and%%losses on contracts that hedge certain balances of a temporary nature are%%included in results of operations.%%Employee Benefits%%Pension Plans%%Substantially all employees of the Company are covered under noncontributory%%defined benefit pension plans. The Company uses the projected unit credit%%actuarial cost method for determining pension cost for financial reporting%%purposes. Amounts contributed to the Company\\'s pension plans are actuarially%%determined, principally under the aggregate cost actuarial method, and are%%subject to applicable federal income tax regulations.%%Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions%%Substantially all employees of the Company are covered under postretirement%%health and life insurance benefit plans.%%Effective January 1, 1991, the Company adopted Statement of Financial%%Accounting Standards No. 106, \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postretirement%%Benefits Other Than Pensions,\" which requires accrual accounting for all%%postretirement benefits other than pensions. Under the prescribed accrual%%method, the Company\\'s obligation for these postretirement benefits is to be%%fully accrued by the date employees attain full eligibility for such benefits.%%A portion of the postretirement accrued benefit obligation is contributed to%%501(c)(9) trusts and 401h accounts under applicable federal income tax%%regulations. The amounts contributed to these trusts and accounts are%%actuarially determined, principally under the aggregate cost actuarial method.%%Postemployment Benefits%%The Company provides employees with postemployment benefits such as%%disability benefits, workers\\' compensation, and severance pay.%%Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial%%Accounting Standards No. 112, \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postemployment%%Benefits,\" which requires accrual accounting for the estimated cost of benefits%%provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before%%retirement. Prior to 1993, the cost of these benefits was primarily charged to%%expense as the benefits were paid.%%Savings Plans and Employee Stock Ownership Plans%%The Company maintains savings plans which cover substantially all of its%%employees. A substantial portion of the Company\\'s matching contribution is%%provided through employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs). The Company recognizes%%expense based on accounting rules applicable to companies with ESOP trusts that%%held securities prior to December 15, 1989. Under this method, the Company%%recognizes 80 percent of the cumulative expense that would have been recognized%%under the shares allocated method.%%The obligations of the ESOP trusts, which are guaranteed by the Company, are%%recorded as long-term debt and the offsetting deferred compensation is%%classified as a reduction of Shareowners\\' Investment. As the ESOP trusts make%%principal payments, the Company reduces the long-term debt balance. The%%deferred compensation balance is reduced by the amount of employee compensation%%recognized as the ESOP shares are allocated to participants.%%Income Taxes%%Bell Atlantic Corporation and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated%%federal income tax return.%%Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial%%Accounting Standards No. 109, \"Accounting for Income Taxes\" (Statement No.%%109), which requires the determination of deferred taxes using the%%20%%liability method. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are provided on%%book and tax basis differences and deferred tax balances are adjusted to%%reflect enacted changes in income tax rates.%%Prior to 1993, the Company accounted for income taxes based on the provisions%%of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11, \"Accounting for Income Taxes\"%%(APB No. 11). Under APB No. 11, deferred taxes were generally provided to%%reflect the effect of timing differences on the recognition of revenue and%%expense determined for financial and income tax reporting purposes. Certain of%%the telephone subsidiaries did not fully provide deferred income taxes on%%certain timing differences when regulators permitted only income taxes actually%%paid to be recognized currently as a cost of service.%%The Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed the investment tax credit (ITC) as of%%January 1, 1986, subject to certain transitional rules. ITCs of the telephone%%subsidiaries were deferred and are being amortized as a reduction to income tax%%expense over the estimated service lives of the related assets.%%Earnings Per Common Share%%Earnings per common share calculations are based on the weighted average%%number of shares and equivalent shares outstanding during the year and reflect%%the shares issued in April 1992 in connection with the merger with Metro Mobile%%CTS, Inc. as outstanding for all years presented.%%Prior to January 1, 1993, for purposes of computing earnings per common%%share, net income attributable to common shares included the income tax benefit%%resulting from dividends paid on shares held by the Company\\'s ESOPs. As a%%result of implementing Statement No. 109, the Company no longer includes the%%income tax benefit resulting from dividends paid on unallocated shares held by%%ESOPs in net income attributable to common shares for purposes of computing%%earnings per share. Pursuant to the provisions of Statement No. 109, the income%%tax benefit resulting from dividends paid on allocated shares is included in%%net income.%%Reclassifications%%Certain reclassifications of prior years\\' data have been made to conform to%%1993 classifications.%%2.DEBT%%Long-Term%%Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31:%%INTEREST%%RATES     MATURITIES   1993      1992%%---------------------------------  --------%%(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)%%Communications and Related%%Services%%Telephone subsidiaries\\' deben-%%tures:                          3.25%--7.00% 1995--2025 $1,972.0  $1,827.0%%7.125%--7.75% 2002--2033  2,105.0   2,155.0%%7.85%--8.75% 1994--2031  1,480.0   1,575.0%%--------  --------%%5,557.0   5,557.0%%Unamortized discount and premium, net..................

Payment of performance share awards is based on the%%achievement of financial, market performance, and other objectives set by the%%Board of Directors, typically over a five year period, and made in stock,%%unless otherwise determined by the Board.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS%%Pension Plans%%Substantially all of the Company\\'s management and associate employees are%%covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans.

The%%Company\\'s objective in funding the plans is to accumulate funds at a relatively%%stable level over participants\\' working lives so that benefits are fully funded%%at retirement.

The special termination benefit costs and%%28%%the net effect of changes in plan provisions, certain actuarial assumptions,%%and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to demographic and%%investment experience increased pension cost in 1992.

The assumed rate%%of future increases in compensation levels was 5.25% at December 31, 1993 and%%1992. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.25% for 1993%%and 1992, and 7.5% for 1991. The vested benefit obligation represents the%%actuarial present value of vested benefits to which employees are currently%%entitled based on the employees\\' expected dates of separation or retirement.%%The Company has in the past entered into collective bargaining agreements%%with the unions representing certain employees and expects to do so in the%%future. Pension benefits have been included in these agreements and%%improvements in benefits have been made from time to time. Additionally, the%%Company has amended the benefit formula under pension plans maintained for its%%management employees. Expectations with respect to future amendments to the%%Company\\'s pension plans have been reflected in determining the Company\\'s%%pension cost under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87,%%\"Employers\\' Accounting for Pensions\" (Statement No. 87). Since the projected%%benefit obligation, as calculated under Statement No. 87, relies on assumptions%%concerning future events, a comparison of the projected benefit obligation to%%the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 1993 and 1992 may not be%%meaningful.%%Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions%%Effective January 1, 1991, the Company adopted Statement of Financial%%Accounting Standards No. 106, \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postretirement%%Benefits Other Than Pensions\" (Statement No. 106). Statement No. 106 requires%%accrual accounting for all postretirement benefits other than pensions. Under%%the prescribed accrual method, the Company\\'s obligation for these%%postretirement benefits is fully accrued by the date employees attain full%%eligibility for such benefits.%%In conjunction with the adoption of Statement No. 106, the Company elected,%%for financial reporting purposes, to recognize immediately the accumulated%%postretirement benefit obligation for current and future retirees, net of the%%fair value of plan assets and recognized accrued postretirement benefit cost%%(transition obligation), in the amount of $1,554.3 million, net of a deferred%%income tax benefit of $945.6 million.%%For purposes of measuring the interstate rate of return achieved by the%%telephone subsidiaries, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permits%%recognition of postretirement benefit costs, including amortization of the%%transition obligation, in accordance with the prescribed accrual method%%included in Statement No. 106. In%%29%%January 1993, the FCC denied adjustments to the interstate price cap formula%%which would have permitted tariff increases to reflect the incremental%%postretirement benefit cost resulting from the adoption of Statement No. 106.%%Accrued postretirement benefit cost, including amortization of the%%transition obligation, has generally been recognized for purposes of measuring%%the intrastate rate of return achieved by the telephone subsidiaries. In%%Maryland, Delaware, and the District of Columbia, the postretirement benefit%%cost recognized for intrastate rate of return measurement purposes is not in%%accordance with the prescribed amortization method in Statement No. 106. New%%Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have not authoritatively approved the%%recognition of postretirement benefit cost in excess of pay-as-you-go amounts.%%In Virginia, recognition of postretirement benefit cost, including the%%amortization of the transition obligation, is permitted for rate of return%%measurement purposes, so long as recognition of such costs does not cause the%%company to seek a rate increase. Tariff increases for substantially all of the%%incremental intrastate postretirement benefit cost resulting from the adoption%%of Statement No. 106 have not been permitted.%%Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, \"Accounting%%for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation\" (Statement No. 71), a%%regulatory asset associated with the recognition of the transition obligation%%was not recorded because of uncertainties as to the timing and extent of%%recovery given the Company\\'s assessment of its long-term competitive%%environment.%%Substantially all of the Company\\'s management and associate employees are%%covered under postretirement health and life insurance benefit plans. The%%determination of benefit cost for postretirement health benefit plans is based%%on comprehensive hospital, medical, surgical, and dental benefit plan%%provisions. The postretirement life insurance benefit formula used in the%%determination of postretirement benefit cost is primarily based on annual%%basic pay at retirement.%%The Company funds the postretirement health and life insurance benefits of%%current and future retirees. Plan assets consist principally of investments in%%domestic and foreign corporate equity securities, and U.S. Government and%%corporate debt securities.%%Postretirement benefit cost is composed of the following:%%YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,   YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,%%1993                      1992                       1991%%-------------------------  ------------------------  -------------------------%%LIFE                       LIFE                      LIFE%%HEALTH  INSURANCE  TOTAL   HEALTH  INSURANCE TOTAL   HEALTH  INSURANCE  TOTAL%%------  --------- -------  ------  --------- ------  ------  --------- -------%%(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)%%Benefits earned during%%the year............... $ 64.9   $  8.4   $  73.3  $ 55.4   $  8.7   $ 64.1  $ 50.5   $  7.2   $  57.7%%Interest on accumulated%%postretirement benefit%%obligation.............  270.1     32.0     302.1   234.1     32.8    266.9   221.5     30.5     252.0%%Actual return on plan%%assets.................

The Company has%%periodically modified benefits under plans maintained for its management%%employees. Expectations with respect to future amendments to the Company\\'s%%postretirement benefit plans have been reflected in determining the Company\\'s%%postretirement benefit cost under Statement No. 106.%%Postemployment Benefits%%Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial%%Accounting Standards No. 112, \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postemployment%%Benefits\" (Statement No. 112). Statement No. 112 requires accrual accounting%%for the estimated cost of benefits provided to former or inactive employees%%after employment but before retirement. This change principally affects the%%Company\\'s accounting for disability and workers\\' compensation benefits, which%%previously were charged to expense as the benefits were paid.%%The cumulative effect at January 1, 1993 of adopting Statement No. 112%%reduced net income by $85.0 million, net of a deferred income tax benefit of%%$50.6 million. The adoption of Statement No. 112 did not have a significant%%effect on the Company\\'s ongoing level of operating expense in 1993.%%Savings Plans and Employee Stock Ownership Plans%%The Company has established savings plans to provide opportunities for%%eligible employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis and encourage%%employees to acquire and maintain an equity interest in the Company. Under%%these plans, the Company matches a certain percentage of eligible employee%%contributions with shares of the Company\\'s common stock. Two leveraged employee%%stock ownership plans (ESOPs) were established to purchase the Company\\'s common%%stock and fund the Company\\'s matching contribution. Common stock is allocated%%from the ESOP trusts based on the proportion of principal and interest paid on%%ESOP debt in a year to the remaining principal and interest due over the term%%of the debt.%%31%%The ESOP trusts were funded by the issuance of $790.0 million in ESOP Senior%%Notes. Effective January 1, 1993, the annual interest rate on the ESOP Senior%%Notes was reduced from 8.25% to 8.17%. The ESOP Senior Notes are payable in%%semiannual installments, which began on January 1, 1990 and end in the year%%2000. The ESOP trusts will repay the notes, including interest, with funds from%%the Company\\'s contributions to the ESOP trusts, as well as dividends received%%on unallocated shares of common stock and interest earned on the cash balances%%of the ESOP trusts.%%Total ESOP cost and trust activity consists of the following:%%YEARS ENDED DECEMBER%%31,%%----------------------%%1993    1992    1991%%------  ------  ------%%(DOLLARS IN%%MILLIONS)%%Compensation............................................ $ 45.0  $ 42.2  $ 39.7%%Interest incurred.......................................   52.9    57.7    61.3%%Dividends...............................................

Statement No. 109 requires the determination of deferred taxes using the%%liability method. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are provided on%%book and tax basis differences and deferred tax balances are adjusted to%%reflect enacted changes in income tax rates. Prior to 1993, the Company%%accounted for income taxes based on the provisions of Accounting Principles%%Board Opinion No. 11.%%Statement No. 109 has been adopted on a prospective basis and amounts%%presented for prior years have not been restated. As of January 1, 1993, the%%Company recorded a tax benefit of $65.2 million, which has been reflected in%%the Consolidated Statement of Income as the cumulative effect of a change in%%accounting principle. This tax benefit is principally attributable to net%%operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of the Metro Mobile CTS, Inc. (Metro Mobile)%%subsidiaries that the Company expects to realize based on projections of future%%taxable income.%%Upon adoption of Statement No. 109, the effects of required adjustments to%%deferred tax balances of the telephone subsidiaries were primarily deferred on%%the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with%%Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, \"Accounting for the Effects%%of Certain Types of Regulation\" (Statement No. 71). At January 1, 1993, the%%telephone subsidiaries recorded income tax-related regulatory assets totaling%%$976.6 million in Other Assets. These regulatory assets represent the%%anticipated future regulatory recognition of the Statement No. 109 adjustments%%to recognize (i) temporary differences for which deferred taxes had not been%%provided and (ii) the increase in the deferred state tax liability which%%resulted from increases in state income tax rates subsequent to the dates the%%deferred taxes were recorded. In addition, income tax-related regulatory%%liabilities totaling $1,043.8 million were recorded in Deferred Credits and%%Other Liabilities--Other. These regulatory liabilities represent the%%anticipated future regulatory recognition of the Statement No. 109 adjustments%%to recognize (i) a reduced deferred tax liability resulting from decreases in%%federal income tax rates subsequent to the dates the deferred taxes were%%recorded and (ii) a deferred tax benefit required to recognize the effects of%%the temporary differences attributable to the Company\\'s policy of accounting%%for investment tax credits using the deferred method. These deferred taxes and%%regulatory assets and liabilities have been increased for the tax effect of%%future revenue requirements. These regulatory assets and liabilities are%%amortized at the time the related deferred taxes are recognized in the%%ratemaking process.%%Prior to the adoption of Statement No. 109, the telephone subsidiaries had%%income tax timing differences for which deferred taxes had not been provided%%pursuant to the ratemaking process of approximately $615 million and $522%%million at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively. These timing differences%%principally related to the allowance for funds used during construction and%%certain taxes and payroll-related construction costs capitalized%%32%%for financial statement purposes, but deducted currently for income tax%%purposes, net of applicable depreciation. At December 31, 1992 and 1991,%%deferred state taxes had not been provided on an additional $2,057 million and%%$1,999 million, respectively, of income tax timing differences, principally%%related to accelerated tax depreciation.%%The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which was enacted in August%%1993, increased the federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 35%,%%effective January 1, 1993. In the third quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a%%net charge to the tax provision of approximately $3 million, which included an%%approximate $20 million charge for the nine month effect of the 1% rate%%increase, largely offset by a one-time net benefit of approximately $17 million%%related to adjustments to deferred tax assets associated with the%%postretirement benefit obligation of the telephone subsidiaries and the%%deferred tax liabilities and assets of the nonregulated subsidiaries (including%%the recorded benefit of the Metro Mobile pre-acquisition NOLs).%%Pursuant to Statement No. 71, the effect of the income tax rate increase on%%the deferred tax balances of the telephone subsidiaries was primarily deferred%%through the establishment of regulatory assets of $23.9 million and the%%reduction of regulatory liabilities of $94.1 million. The telephone%%subsidiaries did not recognize regulatory assets and liabilities related to the%%postretirement benefit obligation or the associated deferred income tax asset.%%The components of income tax expense from continuing operations are as%%follows:%%YEARS ENDED DECEMBER%%31,%%-----------------------%%1993     1992    1991%%-------  ------  ------%%(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)%%Current:%%Federal............................................... $ 814.0  $614.9  $588.1%%State and local.......................................   150.0   134.7   124.5%%-------  ------  ------%%964.0   749.6   712.6%%-------  ------  ------%%Deferred:%%Federal...............................................

Substantially all of this investment exceeded the recorded%%value of the proportionate share of the underlying net assets and is being%%amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 25 years.%%Subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, the Company has agreed to%%invest up to a total of $1.04 billion in Iusacell to acquire a 42% (or, under%%certain circumstances, up to a 46%) economic interest.%%13.MERGER WITH METRO MOBILE CTS, INC.%%On April 30, 1992, Bell Atlantic issued approximately 34.3 million shares of%%its common stock to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of%%Metro Mobile CTS, Inc. (Metro Mobile) in a transaction accounted for as a%%pooling of interests. Accordingly, the Company\\'s financial statements were%%restated to include the accounts and operations of Metro Mobile. The Metro%%Mobile businesses include companies that own, operate, and control cellular%%telephone systems serving markets located in the Northeast, Southeast, and%%Southwest regions of the United States and, in addition, companies engaged in%%the sale and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas.%%35%%In the second quarter of 1992, the Company recorded a charge of $47.3 million%%for the cost of consummating the merger and integrating the operations of the%%companies.%%In 1993, the Company issued 883,832 shares of common stock to settle certain%%litigation arising from the merger with Metro Mobile.%%14.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS%%Off-Balance-Sheet Risk%%The Company is party to interest rate swap contracts on its direct finance%%lease receivable transfer agreements and on its debt. These contracts entail%%the exchange of floating and fixed rate interest payments periodically over the%%life of the contracts.%%At December 31, 1993 and 1992, interest rate swap contracts on receivable%%transfer agreements, which have the effect of fixing interest rates on floating%%rate direct finance lease receivable transfer agreements, amounted to $414.4%%million and $476.4 million, respectively. The contracts outstanding at December%%31, 1993 mature from 1994 to 1997 and have fixed rates payable ranging from%%4.08% to 7.96%. The contracts outstanding at December 31, 1992 had maturity%%dates ranging from 1993 to 1996 and had the effect of fixing interest rates on%%the agreements from 4.32% to 7.96%.%%Interest rate swap contracts that have the effect of fixing the rate of%%interest on $115.0 million and $420.0 million of debt were outstanding at%%December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The contracts that were outstanding%%at December 31, 1993 expire during 1994 and effectively fix the rate of%%interest on the debt at rates of 3.65% to 7.72%. The contracts that were%%outstanding at December 31, 1992 had expiration dates ranging from 1993 to 1994%%and had the effect of fixing interest rates on the debt from 3.41% to 9.56%.%%Additionally, at December 31, 1992, interest rate swap contracts, which%%expired during 1993, were used to convert fixed interest rates ranging from%%7.45% to 7.53% on $35.0 million of debt to floating rates.%%The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of%%foreign exchange fluctuations on exposed balances. At December 31, 1992, the%%outstanding face amounts of these contracts totaled 243.0 million New Zealand%%Dollars which were exchanged for $124.0 million.%%Concentrations of Credit Risk%%Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations%%of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, trade%%receivables, and various hedging instruments, principally interest rate swap%%agreements and foreign currency contracts.%%The Company places its temporary cash investments with high-credit-quality%%financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to%%any one financial institution. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to%%trade receivables other than those from AT&T (Note 15) are limited due to the%%large number of customers included in the Company\\'s customer base.%%In management of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange%%and interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements%%and forward exchange contracts. During 1993 and 1992, the Company entered into%%these contracts with various counterparties. The Company is exposed to credit%%loss in the event of non-performance by these counterparties. The Company%%continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its%%counterparties, and limits the amount of contracts it enters into with any one%%party. While the Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of%%nonperformance by its counterparties, it does not expect to incur such losses.%%Fair Value of Financial Instruments%%The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of%%each class of financial instruments.%%Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments, Accounts Receivable,%%Accounts Payable, Accrued Liabilities, and Forward Exchange Contracts%%The carrying amount approximates fair value.%%36%%Debt Maturing Within One Year and Long-Term Debt%%The fair value of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt is%%estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or%%is based on the net present value of the future expected cash flows using%%current interest rates.%%Finance Notes Receivable%%Fair values of finance notes receivable are based on the net present value of%%the future expected cash flows using current interest rates or on quoted market%%prices for similar instruments, where available.%%Interest Rate Swap Agreements%%The fair value of interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount that%%the Company would have to pay to terminate the swap agreements at December 31,%%1993 and 1992, taking into account current interest rates and the%%creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.%%The estimated fair values of the Company\\'s financial instruments are as%%follows:%%DECEMBER 31, 1993 DECEMBER 31, 1992%%----------------- -----------------%%CARRYING   FAIR   CARRYING   FAIR%%AMOUNT   VALUE    AMOUNT   VALUE%%-------- -------- -------- --------%%(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)%%Financial Instruments on the Balance%%Sheets:%%Debt maturing within one year, excluding%%capital lease obligations................ $2,666.5 $2,696.3 $2,672.4 $2,702.2%%Long-term debt, excluding unamortized%%discount and premium and capital lease%%obligations.............................. $7,207.2 $7,512.0 $7,343.7 $7,472.9%%Finance notes receivable.................. $  926.5 $  924.5 $  882.5 $  886.5%%Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-%%Sheet Risk:%%Unrealized loss on interest rate swap%%agreements...............................      --  $    1.6      --  $   14.0%%15.SEGMENT INFORMATION%%Communications and Related Services--Provides voice and data transport and%%calling services, network access, directory publishing, inside wire%%maintenance, and public telephones to customers in the mid-Atlantic region;%%provides billing and collection services to interexchange carriers; provides%%cellular mobile communications products and services; markets and maintains%%customer premises equipment to originate, route, or receive tele-%%communications; services and repairs computers; and provides software%%development and support, systems integration, and telecommunications and data%%processing equipment sales and consulting.%%Financial, Real Estate, and Other Services--Engages in lease financing of%%commercial, industrial, medical, and high-technology equipment and in real%%estate investment and development; sells and distributes liquefied petroleum%%gas.%%37%%1993       1992       1991%%---------  ---------  ---------%%(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)%%Operating revenues:%%Communications and Related Services.......... $12,534.8  $12,164.6  $11,850.2%%Financial, Real Estate, and Other Services...     455.4      553.8      701.9%%---------  ---------  ---------%%$12,990.2  $12,718.4  $12,552.1%%=========  =========  =========%%Operating profit:%%Communications and Related Services.......... $ 2,821.6  $ 2,526.9  $ 2,566.1%%Financial, Real Estate, and Other Services...      32.4       27.7        1.8%%---------  ---------  ---------%%2,854.0    2,554.6    2,567.9%%Corporate expense.............................
